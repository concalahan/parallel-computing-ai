{"result": 0, "title": "HTC U12 Plus review: The biggest miss of 2018 so far | Trusted Reviews", "description": "## Sections  * Page 1 HTC U12 Plus  * Page 2 [Performance and Software]()HTC has used a wide 18:9 panel in the U12 Plus and it ticks most of the boxesI look for in a flagship screen. It benefits from a quad-HD resolution, fullcoverage of the DCI-P3 colour gamut and offers support for HDR. Viewing anglesare decent and the panel hits a competent level of brightness – although it’snowhere near the degree seen on the Samsung Galaxy S9 or LG G7.The issue with the display is that it’s simply ‘okay’. The Super LCD 5 paneljust can’t compete with the OLEDs that feature in rival devices. It lacks theperfect blacks and rich colours, plus there’s very limited customisation.[ Next  Performance and Software](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/htc-u12-plus-performance-and-software)"}
