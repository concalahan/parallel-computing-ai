It can\ndo 0-60mph in just 3.2 seconds when in “Ludicrous” mode (really), which is\nsupercar-fast. The normal 90D model can ‘only’ do it in 4.8-seconds, which is\nclearly far too long.\n\nAs it’s a Tesla, of course, the main thing to note here is that the Model X\nruns entirely on its two batteries, which power all four wheels along for 250\nmiles on a single charge. That charge can be attained in just 30 minutes when\ndone at a Tesla station.\n\nThe most visually arresting feature of the Model X, though, is its falcon\ndoors. These operate rather like the gull wing doors of your average DeLorean,\nbut with a far more practical hinge half way up. This ensures that you won’t\nbe trapped in your averag multistory car park, and it also allows you to\neffectively stand up in the rear of the car.\n\nThat latter feature will be of particular use to those with young families.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nAnother thing that will appeal to families is the Tesla X’s safety features.\nThe battery is positioned low in the car, minimising the risk of roll-over,\nwhilst its support structure provides additional protection from side impacts.\nAlso, as the Model X doesn’t have an engine as such, the front trunk doubles\nas an impact-absorbing crumple zone.\n\nThe Model X also has active sensors with emergency braking and collision\navoidance systems. But all that is small fry next to the Model X’s stand-out\nsafety feature.\n\nAt the launch event, Tesla CEO (and real life Tony Stark) Elon Musk boasted of\nthe car’s “bioweapon defence mode” button, which cranks up the car’s medical\ngrade HEPA air filter system and creates positive pressure within the car to\nkeep pretty much anything unsavoury out. It seems you’ll be both comfortable\nand safe during the apocalypse, provided you’re driving at the time.\n\n**SEE ALSO:[Tesla announces the best friend referral deal\never](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/tesla-announces-the-best-friend-\nreferral-offer-ever)**\n\nThe Tesla Model X won’t come cheap, of course. The stand 90D starts from\n$132,000 (£87,000), while the sportier P90D starts from $142,000 (£94,000).\n\nTesla has started rolling out its Model X to customers already, but anyone\nputting their name down now should be aware that the estimated delivery time\nstretches to the latter half of 2016.\n\n"}
