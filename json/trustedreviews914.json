That’s with a 3,600mAhbattery. The Note 7, in contrast, has to power a bigger screen and stylusfunctionality. Both phones run on Android Marshmallow, so the Note doesn’thave any power-saving features that the Edge doesn’t.All of this has us slightly – and we mean _slightly_ – concerned that the Note7 won’t offer quite the battery performance we were hoping for. That said,we’re yet to test it out, so we can’t say for sure at this point whether theNote 7’s cell is up to the task or not.## Samsung Galaxy Note 7 vs Galaxy S7 – Price & Release Date  The S7 and S7 Edge have been available for a few months now, and you cancurrently get your hands on the former for around £550, and the latter foraround £630. These prices will obviously come down as the months go on, butthat’s what you’re looking at for the time being.The Note 7 has been given a September 2 release date by Samsung, and will goon sale for an eye-watering £749. While it’s obviously a premium device,that’s a lot of money to shell out, especially when you consider the Galaxy S7and S7 Edge are equally capable when it comes to performance.## SummaryThere’s no doubt the Note 7 is a more capable device than the S7 and the S7Edge. The S Pen support alone adds a load more functionality, and you’ve gotthe extra iris scanner to consider. But it’s also a more bulky device. Theincreased screen size means the Note 7 isn’t the slickest-looking thingaround.Overall, then, you can’t really go wrong with any of these Samsung handsets.The Note 7 and the S7 should be identical in terms of performance, offeringthe fastest and most advanced user experience you can currently get in asmartphone.**[Buy Now: Galaxy Note 7 at Amazon.com from $969](http://amzn.to/2bCRi8T)**Which one you choose will be down to which design you prefer, whether you needa stylus, and whether you mind carrying the extra weight around.
