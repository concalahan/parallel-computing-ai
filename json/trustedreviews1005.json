Now folks in the USA will have\nthe chance to pick up the device, but you won’t be able to get it from\ncarriers and it’ll be restricted to GSM networks.\n\nInstead, Huawei is selling the phone unlocked through the likes of Amazon,\nBest Buy and, interestingly, Microsoft. You’ll be able to pick it up in both\nonline and retail Microsoft stores. It’ll retail for $799.\n\nThis is one of the first devices Huawei is really pushing in the States with a\nbig marketing campaign and a partnership with Wonder Woman star Gal Gadot.\nWhether this will translate into sales remains to be seen.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIf you’re unaware of the Mate 10 Pro, then here’s a quick refresher. The phone\nboasts an HDR 5.9-inch 1080p display, Kirin 970 AI infused CPU and a\n12-megapixel f/1.6 camera.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nIn our verdict we said: “If you’re on the market for a top-end phablet, but\ndon’t want to spend the extortionate cost of a [Galaxy Note\n8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-8) or [iPhone\nX](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-x), the Mate 10 Pro is the\nbest option available. As a piece of hardware the Mate 10 Pro is a gorgeous\ndevice, offering users slick performance, an above-average camera and\nexcellent battery life, all contained in a slick mixed metal-and-glass\ndesign.”\n\nThe Mate 10 Pro will be up for pre-order from February 4, with an official\nrelease date of the 18. If you pre-order the phone you’ll get a $150 gift card\nin return, which is a nice touch.\n\n"}
