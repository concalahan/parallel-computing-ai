But it seems Google has changed its tack, and\nsays that we’ll soon see fully wireless ‘Standalone VR’ headsets – no more\nphone-docking.\n\nTo bring that vision to reality, Google partnered with US chipmaker Qualcomm\nto develop a new Daydream VR headset that’s powered by the company’s\n[Snapdragon 835](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/snapdragon-835-phones-\nprocessor-specs-speed-benchmark-chipset-cores) VR platform. That platform runs\non the powerful Snapdragon 835 chipset that we’ve already seen debuted in the\n[Samsung Galaxy S8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-s8-review),\n[Sony Xperia XZ Premium](https://www.trustedreviews.com/sony-xperia-xz-\npremium-review), and [HTC U11](https://www.trustedreviews.com/htc-u11-review)\nsmartphones.\n\nSpeaking about the announcement, Keith Kressin, Senior VP of Product\nManagement at Qualcomm, said: “We are thrilled to once again work with Google\nand offer a powerful premium Snapdragon experience for devices on the Daydream\nplatform.\n\nKressin continued: “Our companies share the same vision: to make it possible\nfor everyone to enjoy rich and immersive VR experiences on a smartphone device\nor a dedicated VR head-mounts display while being fully mobile, rather than\nbeing restricted by cables or limited to predefined rooms setup for outside-in\ntracking.”\n\nIt’s important to note that Qualcomm won’t be selling this virtual reality\nheadset directly to consumers. It’s simply a reference design, which means\nthird-party companies will use the platform to build their own creations –\nwith their own individual branding.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nQualcomm says that the first of these headsets are expected to “hit shelves\nlater this year”, although pricing and exact release dates are still unknown.\nHowever, HTC has confirmed that it will be building a Standalone VR headset\nfor the Daydream platform.\n\nGoogle’s VP of virtual reality Clay Bavor said: “The Daydream standalone\nheadset reference design created in close partnership with Qualcomm will\nenable manufacturers to build a whole new category of VR devices.”\n\nHe went on: “These headsets have everything needed for VR, built right into\nthe headset itself and are as easy to use as picking them up. They’ll feature\nWorldSense for positional tracking right out of the box without any external\nequipment. We’re thrilled that headsets will begin to hit shelves later this\nyear.”\n\nWe don’t have a full list of brands to support Qualcomm’s new platform just\nyet, but we do know that both Lenovo and HTC are developing wireless,\nstandalone, highly portable headsets for Daydream. HTC, which already sells\nthe super-high-end [HTC Vive VR](https://www.trustedreviews.com/htc-vive-\nreview) headset, confirmed the news in a blog post:\n\n“Vive will be building one of the first standalone headsets for the Daydream\nplatform, to come out later this year. We have been working closely with\ndevelopers and consumers to define the best VR experiences over the past few\nyears, and are perfectly positioned to deliver the most premium standalone\nheadset and user experience.”\n\nHTC says that the standalone headset will provide a “deeper and more\nimmersive” portable VR experience than ever before, and that it will be\nsimple, easy-to-use, and will have no cables to connect: “Just pick it up, put\nit on and be fully immersed in your new reality.”\n\n**Related:[Android\nO](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/android-o-8-features-preview-name-\nrumours-release-date-news-download-beta)**\n\n**What do you think of Google’s latest VR announcement?
