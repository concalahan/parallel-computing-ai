With Echo, you can call other devices in your home or evento friends over the internet, and with the Echo Show that turns into videocalling. There’s also a Drop In feature, where you can listen-in to anotherEcho, which is a handy way of having a chat or calling the kids down fordinner. For security, you can block Drop In and calling features on each Echo.Google has a Broadcast feature, which sends a recorded message out to all ofthe speakers in your home. It’s not quite as convenient or as useful asAmazon’s feature.Google now has its hands-free voice calling feature available in the UK. Withthis, you can make high-quality calls for free to local mobile phones andlandlines. This could be a great thing for anyone with a mobile plan thatdoesn’t come with many voice minutes. And, if you set your caller ID in theHome app, calls go out as though you made them on your own mobile phone.Voice quality is excellent on both the Google Home and Google Home Mini,easily beating the best hands-free option on any smartphone. Calls can be madeto any contact in your address book, or to phone numbers found in local searchresults, such as a takeaway restaurant. Smartly, Google Home can pull indifferent contacts based on the user it recognises, so each person in yourhouse can make their own calls to people they know.Amazon has launched a similar service in the US, although there’s no UKrelease date for this feature yet.## Google Home vs Amazon Echo – ConclusionBoth are great products, and the choice between them is likely to come down towhat you want to do. Google Home is more natural to converse with and a littlesmarter out of the box. If you’re largely looking for a personal assistant,it’s the best choice. Google’s Cast integration makes it brilliant for anyonewith a Chromecast or Cast-enabled speakers, too. And, it now has parity withAmazon in terms of smart home support (bar the odd product), app control androutines.That said, Echo has a wider range of speakers, including the fancy screen-enabled Echo Show. While Alexa is a little trickier to talk to, its huge rangeof Skills means that the Echo can do more than Google Home can. Smart homecontrol is still brilliant, but Amazon doesn’t have quite the lead it once didand now Google matches Amazon feature-for-feature. If you want the range ofexpandable skills or like a wider choice of device, Amazon Echo is the systemto buy; for a smarter personal assistant go with Google.**Which of these assistants do you want to, er, assist you?
