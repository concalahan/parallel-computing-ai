It’s very\nspecial to put the car outside and in the real-world. You can see the true\nvalue of the I-PACE’s dramatic silhouette and powerful proportions when you\nsee it on the road, against other cars.”\n\n__He continued: “The I-PACE Concept represents the next generation of battery\nelectric vehicle design. For me, the future of motoring has arrived.”\n\n![Jaguar IPACE\n7](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)_Jaguar’s Director of Design Ian Callum alongside the new\nI-PACE_\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThe Jaguar I-PACE is an SUV, which means it’s effectively an electric\nevolution of the recently released Jaguar F-PACE SUV. Jaguar is describing it\nas a “long distance sprinter”, promising a range of over 500km from a 90kWh\nlithium-ion battery, as well as impressive 0-60mph acceleration in just four\nseconds.\n\nJaguar also says that the all-wheel drive I-PACE will be capable of an 80%\ncharge after just 90 minutes of 50kW DC charging – not bad at all. And thanks\nto “compact, lightweight” electric motors on the front and rear wheel axles,\nyou can expect a combined output of 400PS and 700Nm of torque.\n\n![Jaguar IPACE\n3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\n“The feedback on the I-PACE concept has been fantastic,” explained Callum.\n“With the I-PACE Concept we’ve torn up the rule book to create a vehicle with\nsupercar inspired aesthetics, sports car performance and SUV space, in one\nelectric package.”\n\n“It has surprised people and the enthusiasm for our first electric vehicle has\nbeen beyond all my expectations,” he added.\n\n**Related:[Tesla Model S review](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/tesla-\nmodel-s-review)**\n\n**What do you think of Jaguar’s I-PACE vehicle?
