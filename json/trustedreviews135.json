Let’s take a look.\n\n## iPhone 11: Latest news and rumours\n\nHuzzah! We’ve finally got a release date for the iPhone 11, with Apple now\nhave sent out official invites to its autumn iPhone launch event.\n\nThe Cupertino-based firm’s 2018 iPhones will be revealed on **Wednesday\nSeptember 12** at its Steve Jobs Theater (part of its still shiny Apple Park\nHQ).\n\nInviting attendees to “gather round” from 10am US Pacific time (6pm BST/7pm\nCET), this is the day we’ve all been waiting for – read on for an idea of what\nto expect.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Apple iPhone 11 Specs: What we know about the iPhone XI’s screen\n\nThe successor to the [iPhone\nX](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-x), which could well be\ncalled the iPhone 11 or iPhone XI, will once again feature a Samsung screen,\naccording to a report from _The Wall Street Journal_.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nApple is rumoured to have invested $3 billion into LG Display back in 2017 to\nhelp it expand its screen-making infrastructure, so it can reduce its reliance\non rival Samsung – but it’s now looking like the project isn’t going quite\naccording to plan.\n\n_The Wall Street Journal_ notes that, while it’s unclear what the problem is,\nLG’s production of edge-to-edge OLED screens has hit a snag and may not\nrecover in time to meet the enormous demand for the impending release of the\niPhone X2.\n\nTo make matters worse, Apple is tipped to release two variants of the iPhone X\nin 2018 – one with a 5.8-inch display and one with a 6.5-inch screen – and it\ncould be left with no choice but to source both OLED panels from market rival\nSamsung.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThat said, it’s not unusual for big tech companies to source components from\ntheir competitors, as these firms are often conglomerates where one arm of the\nbusiness has a different agenda to the other – Apple has been sourcing bits\nand bobs from Asia and South Korea, in particular, for some time now.\n\nThe reason Apple is so keen to find another partner to manufacture the OLED\nscreens for the high-end iPhone X successor(s) is that Samsung is the main\nOLED manufacturer, so it has complete control of the going price of the\npanels.\n\nApple knows that Samsung has it over a barrel; if it wanted it could hike the\ncost per unit, forcing Apple to cut costs in other divisions or drive up the\nprice of the next iPhone – both of which would give Sammy a competitive edge.\n\n**Related:[Best smartphone](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nsmartphone-3431175)**\n\nThe screen is the most expensive component on the iPhone X, says _The Wall\nStreet Journal_ , costing $97 of the estimated $376 that the firm spends on\neach unit. Bringing another manufacturer into the fold could slash that\nfigure.\n\n## iPhone 11 Release Date and Price: When does the iPhone XI launch?\n\nApple’s traditional launch pattern sees it unveil new premium smartphones in\nSeptember each year, and as we’ve said, that’s going to be the case again this\nyear, with Apple now having confirmed a special event for Wednesday September\n12.\n\nFollowing its reveal, you can expect iPhone 11 pre-orders to start within the\nweek, and if history is anything to go by the iPhone 11 will start shipping in\nOctober in most regions.\n\n**What feature would you like to see on the iPhone 11?
