Now\npublisher Epic Games is letting its frustrations known about the way that\nGoogle went about disclosing the issue.**\n\nTo understand the disagreement you need to know a little about the nature of\nthe bug, so here is a quick explanation of the exploit. Fortnite isn’t\navailable via the Google Play Store – instead, you have to visit download the\ngame directly from Epic. The idea of this is to avoid the punishing 30% fee\nthat Google takes on all Play Store sales and in-app purchases.\n\nThe problem with this approach is that what you’re downloading from Epic isn’t\nthe game itself – it’s simply an installer. Google discovered that the\ninstaller had a weakness where any app on your phone could hijack the process\nand install something nasty in its place. Worse, because it could also do so\nin the background, the app didn’t need to highlight to users that it was doing\nanything out of the ordinary. Given Fortnite’s popularity, all it would need\nis one popular rogue app to exploit this and you could have a mobile malware\nepidemic.\n\n**Related:**[ **Fortnite Battle Royale\ntips**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/fortnite-battle-royale-\ntips-3383586)\n\nEpic Games fixed the exploit within 48 hours of being told, and if you have\nversion 2.1.0 or newer of the installer you should be clear. All the same, the\nway in which Google has gone public with the exploit has some wondering\nwhether this is a tacit warning to any other big-name developers considering\nbypassing the Google Play Store.\n\n“How does rapidly disclosing the technical details of a security flaw to\nhackers do anything to protect Android users?” [asked Epic CEO Tim Sweeney on\nTwitter](https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1034524974999068674).\n\n“Yes, telling users that a flaw was found and advising updating is valuable,”\nhe added in a follow-up tweet. “But, again, why did Google have to rapidly\ndisclose the technical details? Who does that help, other than the hackers?”\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![fallout 76](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Don’t get your hopes up for Fallout 76 on Nintendo Switch, say Bethesda\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/gaming/bethesda-fallout-76-nintendo-\nswitch-wasnt-doable-3612141 \"Don’t get your hopes up for Fallout 76 on\nNintendo Switch, say Bethesda\")\n\n  * [ ![Elipson Prestige Facet 6B BT](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Elipson Prestige Facet 6B BT\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/elipson-prestige-facet-6b-bt \"Elipson\nPrestige Facet 6B BT\")\n\n  *   * [ ![oneplus 6t launch event live stream](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### OnePlus 6T Launch Event Live Stream: How to watch the unveiling online\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/watch-oneplus-6t-launch-live-\nstream-3612125 \"OnePlus 6T Launch Event Live Stream: How to watch the\nunveiling online\")\n\n  * \n\n**Related:**[ **Fortnite Battle Royale vs\nPUBG**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/pubg-v-fortnite-battle-\nroyale-3383394)\n\nGoogle’s policy is to publicly reveal issues seven days after the private\ndisclosure to ensure that users can take security into their own hands. Epic\napparently wanted 90 days to ensure that the patch was more widely spread\nbefore an explainer on the vulnerability was revealed.\n\nThe popularity of Fortnite has made it an easy target for cybercriminals –\nsomething reflected in Epic’s recent decision to [reward activation of two-\nfactor authentication with a free in-game\nemote](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/fortnite-2-factor-authentication-\nemote-3539233).\n\n**Was Google right to disclose, or should it have given Epic longer to get the\npatch out?
