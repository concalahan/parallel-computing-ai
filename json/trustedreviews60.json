There’s more than just\nSpotify out there, so we’re going to pit the streaming giant against its\nbiggest rivals:[Apple Music](https://www.trustedreviews.com/apple-music-\nreview), Tidal, Google Play Music, Deezer, Amazon Music Unlimited and Qobuz.\nYour ultimate guide to the best Spotify alternatives is right here. **\n\nWhy should you even care? Well, for starters there’s £10/$10 a month riding on\nthis question – and maybe more if you’re looking for the best in sound\nquality.\n\nPut simply, they all have gigantic libraries featuring tens of millions of\ntracks, offer discovery features to help you find new music, and work with the\nvast majority of phones. So we’ll have to dig pretty deep to find out which\nstreaming services comes out on top.\n\nWe’re going to split up this comparison into topics, from price and sound\nquality to whether you can use them online and what the apps are like to use.\n\n**Related:[Spotify event recap (April 2018)\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/spotify-event-april-2018-app-update-\npreview-3455054)**\n\n## Best music streaming service – pricing\n\n**Apple Music:** £9.99/$9.99 a month, £14.99/$14.99 family, £4.99 student  \n**Spotify:** £9.99/$9.99 a month, £14.99/$14.99 family, £4.99/$4.99 student,\nfree ad-funded service  \n**Google Play Music All Access:** £9.99/$9.99 a month, £14.99/$14.99 family,\nfree upload service  \n**Deezer:** £9.99/$9.99 a month, £19.99/$14.99 HiFi (16-bit/44.1kHz),\n£14.99/$14.99 family, £4.99 student, free ad-funded service  \n**Tidal:** £19.99/$19.99 a month HiFi (16-bit/44.1kHz  & MQA), £9.99/$9.99\nregular, no free service, £14.99/£29.99 family, £4.99/£9.99 student  \n**Amazon Music Unlimited:** £9.99/$9.99 a month (reduced to £7.99 a month/£79\na year for Prime subscribers), £14.99/$14.99 family (or £149/$149 a year),\n£3.99/$3.99 a month for Echo only, limited Prime Music service free with Prime\nmembership  \n**Qobuz:** £9.99 a month regular, £19.99 premium (16-bit/44.1kHz), £219.99 a\nyear Sublime, £349.99 a year Sublime+ (24-bit/192kHz)\n\nAll the main music streaming apps charge the same amount for their standard\npremium services. It’s £9.99 or $9.99 a month, and that lets one person listen\nat a time. Amazon offers a discount for Prime subscribers, and you can save\neven more by paying for the full year up front.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Best Laptop 2018: 13 notebooks for every budget\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-laptops-3431966 \"Best Laptop 2018:\n13 notebooks for every budget\")\n\n  * [ ![BEST COFFEE MACHINE DEALS](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Black Friday Coffee Machine Deals – What to expect and deals live now\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/cheap-coffee-machines-on-sale-3472986\n\"Black Friday Coffee Machine Deals – What to expect and deals live now\")\n\n  *   * [ ![iPhone XR](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### iPhone XR teardown suggests it’s the best new iPhone for battery life\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-teardown-battery-life-3613465\n\"iPhone XR teardown suggests it’s the best new iPhone for battery life\")\n\n  * \n\nFour of the services here offer a great student discount, Apple Music, Deezer,\nTidal and Spotify. All charge students £4.99 for their standard service, with\nTidal also offering its HiFi tier at £9.99.\n\nYou can’t just be a 40 year-old hedge fund manager who has music lessons on\nthe weekend, though. Student validation happens through Unidays and NUS Extra\n(Spotify only) in the UK, meaning you’ll need to be studying at a proper\nuniversity or college.\n\nAmazon Echo owners can make use of the discounted £3.99/month subscription for\nlistening purely on their Echo speaker, though, but remember that means no\nlistening on your phone.\n\nSpotify and Deezer even offer a free subscription, too, if you’re really\nstrapped for cash. On a tablet or computer you can listen to the tracks you\nchoose but have to listen to ads every now and then. With a phone, Spotify\nwill only let you listen to music from a limited number of playlists, and\nyou’ll also have to put up with the occasional ad.’\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, there are also premium plans for most of\nthese services. Apple, Spotify, Google, Tidal, Amazon and Deezer all offer a\n‘family’ plan that lets up to six people connect to the same account at once.\n\nUnlike the student deal, there’s no checking that you’re only teaming-up with\nyour brother, mum and auntie, so you can more-or-less share with whoever you\nlike. All the family deals cost £14.99/$14.99 a month.\n\nTidal, Deezer and Qobuz have rather more interesting higher-price subs too,\nones that boost the quality of the music you stream.\n\nDeezer HiFi, Qobuz Hi-Fi and Tidal HiFi all deliver CD quality lossless FLAC\n(16-bit/44.1kHz) for £19.99 a month, but Tidal also features a selection of\n“master” quality Hi Res albums using [MQA\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/what-is-mqa-meridian-s-digital-audio-\nformat-explained-2932975) in at that price as well (though you need to access\nthem through the desktop app currently).\n\nQobuz is a little different, in that it has a couple of ultra-premium tiers,\nwhich are only payable annually. Sublime adds in discounted Hi Res downloads\n(“Hi Res downloads at MP3 prices”) alongside CD-quality streaming, while\nSublime+ bumps up streaming quality to 24-bit/192kHz.\n\n**Related:[Best headphones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nheadphones)**\n\n![best music streaming services\n7](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)_  \nRdio was one of many services to fail against heavy competition_\n\n## Best music streaming service – sound quality\n\n**Apple Music:** 256kbps AAC **  \nSpotify:** up to 320kbps OGG **  \nGoogle Play Music All Access** : Up to 320kbps MP3 **  \nDeezer:** 320kbps MP3, 1411kbps FLAC, MQA **  \nTidal:** 1411kbps FLAC, 320kbps AAC, 24-bit MQA **  \nAmazon Music Unlimited:** Undisclosed, presumed 320kbps **  \nQobuz:** 320kbps MP3, 1411kbps FLAC, 24-bit FLAC\n\nThe little secret that Neil Young and vinyl-stroking bores don’t want to admit\nis that all the main streaming services offer excellent streaming quality.\nUsing the highest grade streams these companies offer, even great ears will\nstruggle to judge between a stream and a CD.\n\nApple Music uses the lowest bit-rate, with 256kbps AAC files, which is\ncomparable to a 320kbps MP3 thanks to the greater efficiency of AAC. Years\nbefore Hi Res became such a buzzword, the consensus was that 320kbps digital\naudio files were largely indistinguishable from CD quality. A good system will\ntell them apart, your phone and on-the-go earbuds may not.\n\nAcross the various services you’ll see a smattering of different codecs used.\nPlay Music, Deezer, Qobuz and likely Amazon use the rather out of date (but\nhighly compatible) MP3, Tidal and Apple Music use AAC and Spotify uses Ogg\nVorbis.\n\nWhile we’d always recommend listening in as high quality as you can, most\nservices also offer stripped-back quality settings for when you’re using\nmobile data and a) want to conserve data use or b) find yourself in an area\nwith crap signal. You’ll take an knock on sound quality, but most will do the\njob for casual on-the-go listening. In fact, Spotify’s 96kbps ‘Normal’ streams\nare among the most enjoyable of the reduced quality streams, despite having\nthe lowest bitrate on paper.\n\n**Related:[Best streaming websites](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nstreaming-sites)**\n\n![Streaming\n3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nAt the other end of the scale, both Deezer and Tidal provide lossless\nstreaming, offering CD quality 1411kbps FLAC. You get this with their\n£19.99/$19.99 HiFi tiers. With compatible hardware, you can also listen to a\nlimited number of each service’s tracks in hi-res MQA.\n\nThere are (at the time of writing) a couple of thousand of these rather than a\nmillion but there’s a lot to like in the smaller selection, and more being\nadded all the time. It’s a little hard to surface sometimes though.\n\nAs mentioned before, Qobuz goes one better than Tidal with just under 70,000\nalbums available to stream at up to 24-bit/192kHz on the Sublime+ tier.\nThere’s a more than generous lean to more classical and jazz genres in the\nselection, but plenty of more recent music is available too.\n\nThe only thing we’re not sure about is just how Qobuz does it. MQA is much\nclearer on how it packages Hi Res music for streaming, Qobuz hasn’t been quite\nso transparent. Still, it works, and sound quality is good, but arguably Tidal\nMasters has the edge.\n\n## Best music streaming service – discovery features\n\n**Apple Music:** Strong curation, Apple Connect social network, Beats 1 Radio\nand genre-based stations **  \nSpotify:** Moderate curation, Facebook integration, optional apps,\nrecommendations based on listening habits/occasions, genre and artist-led\nradio stations, Discover Weekly playlists  \n**Google Play Music All Access:** No curation, recommendations based on\nlistening habits, ad-supported radio station (US only)  \n**Deezer:** Strong curation, Facebook integration, optional apps,\nrecommendations based on listening habits, Flow mixes  \n**Tidal:** Curated content from music journalists, artist interviews  \n**Amazon Music Unlimited:** genre playlists, artist radio  \n**Qobuz:** featured playlists\n\nSome of these services are much newer than Spotify but all are mature enough\nto now offer fairly good music discovery features. We could spend ages\nnoodling on about what each service does, but let’s just take a look at the\nhighlights of each.\n\nSpotify’s best-known discovery tool is the Discover Weekly playlist. Each week\nit gives you 30 tracks Spotify thinks you might like. You also get daily\nmixes, which are built of tracks you’ve already listened to, and Release\nRadar, which rounds up new tracks from artists it knows you like.\n\nDiscover Weekly has proved an inspiration for several of the other services\ntoo. For example, Deezer’s stand-out is Flow. This is an auto-populated\nplaylist that features a mix of new tunes and ones you already like.\n\nAmazon’s effort is arguably a little less sophisticated, and offers a range of\ngenre-based playlists and radio station based on music you’ve listened to\nbefore.\n\nThere are also suggested albums, but they’re a little disappointing. While\nSpotify’s Discover Weekly often uncovers artists you’ll enjoy who you’ve never\nheard before, Amazon’s recommendations don’t stretch much further than\noffering a hip-hop fan a suggestion to listen to 2Pac’s Greatest Hits.\n\n![Streaming\n5](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nApple Music has similar playlists too. “My New Music Mix” and “My Favourites\nMix” lists are updated once a week and, just as they sound, offer playlists of\nnew and familiar music that you don’t have to curate yourself.\n\nApple’s stand-out features are perhaps a little less successful, although you\nmight disagree. Apple Connect is a Twitter-a-like feature that lets artists\npost to fans about their new music, their thoughts on right-wing politics and\nso on. It hasn’t exactly revolutionised the game, though, and lost prominence\nin the last redesign of Apple Music.\n\nThen there’s Beats 1. This is a digital radio station, the Apple equivalent of\nBBC Radio 1. It’s not for everyone but should suit those in-tune with current\ntrends.\n\nGoogle Play Music has a more stripped-back approach to the whole discovery\nside. You just get a rolling home screen of suggested playlists based on your\ntastes. It’s arranged a bit like a digital magazine, heavy on pictures and not\ntoo heavy on content. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, as some people find\nthe packed Spotify app a bit much to deal with.\n\nQobuz and Tidal are similarly laid back. It feels much less like it’s trying\nto second-guess your listening habits and instead just serves up a selection\nof featured playlists and new albums in the hope that you might be interested.\nOn Tidal, there’s also a Tidal Rising section that promotes the new acts the\nTidal bigwigs like.\n\n**Related:[ Best Bluetooth\nspeakers](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-bluetooth-speakers)**  \n**![best music streaming services\n1](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)  \n**_Deezer offers strong music discovery across all of its web, mobile and\nconsole apps_\n\n## Best music streaming service – mobile apps and support\n\n**Apple Music:** iOS, Android, iTunes , Apple Watch  \n**Spotify:** iOS, Android, Windows Phone, BlackBerry, PS4/PS3 app, desktop/web\nplayer, Apple Watch, Android Wear, Amazon Alexa, Google Home  \n**Google Play Music All Access:** Android, iOS, web player, Google Home\nsupport, Android Wear  \n**Deezer:** Android, iOS, Windows Phone, Blackberry, Xbox One, web player,\nApple Watch, Android Wear, Amazon Alexa, Google Home  \n**Tidal:** iOS, Android, desktop/web player  \n**Amazon Music Unlimited:** iOS, Android, Amazon Alexa, Fire tablets, web\nplayer  \n**Qobuz:** iOS, Android, desktop/web player\n\nUnless you still have a Windows Phone or BlackBerry, you don’t have to worry\nmuch about compatibility with your phone. All these services work across\nAndroid and iOS, even those from Google and Apple.\n\nDeezer and Spotify also work on the two outsider operating systems, though\nwith them being on their last legs, the apps are not updated anywhere near as\nmuch as their more popular counterparts.\n\nAll the services also have web players via browser apart from Apple Music,\nalthough you can listen through iTunes. The potential worry here is if you use\na secured work PC that doesn’t let you install extra software like iTunes —\nit’s one of the main reasons you might want to avoid Apple Music.\n\nSpotify has the widest support, found in places where the other services\naren’t. For example, it’s built into some home cinema receivers through\nSpotify Connect, and is generally considered the ‘default’ streaming service\nto support by wireless speaker makers.\n\nQobuz is catching up in this regard though, and supports the likes of Yamaha’s\nMusicCast, as well as DTS Play-Fi and Googlecast.\n\nAs smart home and wearable tech develops, so this area is expanding into\nstreaming too. For example. Google Play Music lets you download tracks for\noffline playback on an Android Wear watch, and is natively supported by the\nGoogle Home smart speaker.\n\nApple Music does similar with Apple Watch, while Spotify and Deezer also boast\nsmartwatch apps too.\n\nIf you’re concerned about compatibility with future hardware, Spotify is the\nplatform with the most reach and the fewest ‘political’ issues. For example,\nwhile Apple Music will be the first music platform supported by Apple’s\nHomePod, it’s safe to assume Spotify will be the second. That’s certainly the\ncase with Amazon’s Echo speakers.\n\nTidal? Not so much. As ever, Tidal is the service for those who are into\nstreaming for the music side, rather than the tech peripheral side. It sticks\nto the standard web and mobile apps, though you will find it built into some\nkey hi-fi kit, like Linn McIntosh and Naim.\n\n**Related:[Best multi-room\nspeakers](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-wireless-speakers)**  \n![best music streaming services\n11](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \n_Spotify still reigns when it comes to app support across multiple platforms_\n\n![Google Play\nMusic](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)**  \n**_Google Play Music All Access lets you upload 50,000 of your own songs to\nthe cloud for free_\n\n## Best music streaming service – offline features\n\n**Apple Music:** Unlimited mobile downloads **  \nSpotify:** 3333 mobile downloads per device, three devices, desktop playlist\ndownloads **  \nGoogle Play Music All Access:** Unlimited mobile downloads **  \nDeezer:** Unlimited mobile and desktop downloads **  \nTidal:** Unlimited mobile downloads  \n**Amazon Music Unlimited:** Unlimited mobile downloads (with 10 authorised\ndevices)  \n**Qobuz:** Unlimited mobile and desktop downloads\n\nAll eight services allow you to download tracks to their mobile apps for\noffline listening, so that’s a good start.\n\nSpotify is the most limiting of the lot, because of its 10,000 track limit.\nThis is split across three devices, divvied up as 3,333 downloads for each. If\nyou’re a big music fan with an even bigger microSD card, this could prove a\nproblem.\n\nWhen using the web player rather than the mobile app, you can only download\nplaylists too. The ‘download’ switch simply doesn’t appear outside of them, in\nalbums for example.\n\nThe rest of these services only limit offline downloads by the amount of\nstorage on your device.\n\nIt’s Google that delivers the most interesting features in this area too. Even\nif you don’t pay for a Play Music subscription, you can upload/sync up to\n50,000 of your own files to the cloud to play them without taking up any of\nyour phone’s storage.\n\nApple has a similar feature, but it’s not free. iTunes Match costs\n£21.99/$24.99 a year, and lets you cloud stream up to 100,000 of your own\ntracks. Of course, these services are quite different to the standard sub.\nYou’re streaming your own music, not new songs you don’t own.\n\n**Related:[ Best soundbars](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nsoundbars)**\n\n![Tidal](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Best music streaming service – music catalogue\n\n**Apple Music:** Over 40 million tracks **  \nSpotify:** Over 40 million tracks **  \nGoogle Play Music All Access:** Over 40 million tracks **  \nDeezer:** Over 43 million tracks **  \nTidal:** Over 46 million tracks  \n**Amazon Music Unlimited:** Over 40 million  \n**Qobuz:** Over 40 million (70,000 in high-res)\n\nFor the most part, you’re looking at about 40 million+ songs on any service at\nany one time, but that number is fluctuating daily as songs are added and\nremoved from the catalogue. Either way, it’s a lot.\n\nWhat matters more are exclusives. A lot has been made of streaming exclusives\nover the past 18 months, but thankfully the habit seems to be dying down.\nAfter all, who benefits other than the giant corporation behind the service\nand the artist, who will likely earn a big payout or huge promotion for\nsigning the deal.\n\nThe biggest exclusives to date have gone to Apple Music and Tidal, which is\nowned by Jay-Z and a “coalition” of other artists including Madonna, Daft Punk\nand Chris Martin of Coldplay.\n\nApple Music bought a limited-time exclusive for Drake’s 2016 album Views to\nbolster the service, while Beyonce’s Lemonade is still streaming exclusively\non Tidal more than a year after its release.\n\nSpotify’s popularity as a music service has seen it negatively targeted by\nartists aligned with other services too, such as Taylor Swift and Jay-Z, who\nhave both removed some of their music from the service (though Taylor has\nrecently re-instated it).\n\nRather than opting for this sort of willy-waving (although it was home to a\nlot of exclusives early on), Spotify tends to favour Spotify Sessions, which\nare (usually acoustic) live recordings, in order to get exclusive content on\nits service. Deezer is also doing similar with its Deezer Sessions.\n\nGoogle Play Music’s Mark Bennett has also spoken out against exclusive\nstreamed albums. While its done it in the past (it streamed Take That’s album\nexclusively in 2015), Bennett now says it would rather win over users with\nfunctionality over exclusives.\n\n![Streaming\n9](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\n## Best music streaming service – popularity\n\n**Apple Music:** 38 million (March 2018) **  \nSpotify:** Over 70 million (Jan 2018) **  \nGoogle Play Music All Access:** Not known **  \nDeezer:** 9 million (Sept 2017) **  \nTidal:** 3 million (controversial)  \n**Amazon Music Unlimited:** 11 million (June 2017, approximated)  \n**Qobuz:** Not known\n\nHopefully you have some idea about which streaming service might be right for\nyou. But which is the most successful?\n\nApple has expanded its audience hugely since its launch, but Spotify is still\nthe clear market leader with 70 million paid subscribers to Apple’s 38\nmillion.\n\nOther services are much less popular. Google hasn’t announced any figures (not\na great sign), and nor has Qobuz, while Tidal was reportedly at a fairly\ndismal 1.2 million paid subs last year (rather than the 3 million quoted by\nJay-Z. This is even after scoring the exclusive on Beyonce’s Lemonade.\n\nDeezer’s figures are estimated at 9 million, which sounds much healthier.\nHowever, you also need to consider that it has been around since 2007, s0\nalmost as long as Spotify.\n\nFor now this is Spotify’s business, with only Apple on track to compete.\n\n**Related:[Best wireless\nheadphones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-wireless-headphones-\nbluetooth-headphones)**\n\n![Spotify](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Spotify vs Apple Music vs the rest – which is the best music streaming\nservice right now?\n\nFor the audio snobs out there, the best services are Deezer, Tidal and Qobuz.\nThey let you stream lossless FLAC files if you sign up for a higher-price\nsubscription, and both Tidal and Qobuz goes a step further by offering a\ngrowing library of even higher-quality 24-bit albums (though you’ll have to\npay a fair whack for the pleasure on Qobuz).\n\nThe best free options are Spotify and Deezer. Google Play Music is also great\nif you’re happy streaming music you already own, while the other two are spot\non for casual music listening when you just need to fill some time, say, at\nthe gym or on the way to work.\n\nAmazon’s Prime Music option is also good for this, though as it’s bundled in\nwith Amazon’s £79/year Prime membership, it isn’t technically ‘free’.\n\nFor all-round music discovery, interface richness and effort-free playlist\ncuration, we’re inclined to stick with Spotify for the time being. However, we\nalso know plenty of people who have moved to Apple Music and don’t regret it,\nand Deezer is catch up fast, matching Spotify in features and pricing.\n\nIf you’re not convinced by any of these service’s stand-out features, the best\nbet is to give a few a go. While Apple Music doesn’t have a free service,\nthere is a generous 3-month trial that is free in the US and UK, and most\nothers will offer you a 30-day taster.
