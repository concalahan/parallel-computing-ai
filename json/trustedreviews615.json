One for the adults and one for the\nkids, perhaps?\n\n“You can find me on all kinds of devices — phones, Google Homes, and if I’m\nlucky in your heart,” Legend said in a video played during the presentation.\nHe’ll also sing to you in certain circumstances, apparently.\n\nSo did John Legend go into an studio with Google and record every word in the\nEnglish language? No.\n\nGoogle says it used the technology called WaveNet it announced 18 months ago.\nThis can be used to create a full vocabulary from less spoken words, which\nopens the door to more celebrities coming to the Assistant in the near future.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n“Wavenet models underlying raw audio to create a more natural voice, its\ncloser to how humans speak. The pitch, the pace, even all the pauses that\nconvey meaning — you want to get all that right,” Google CEO Sundar Pichai\nsaid.\n\n## Natural dialogue\n\nThe changes are part of efforts to improve the Assistant’s natural speech\nabilities. Google says the AI’s dialect is now “closer to how humans speak.”\nThanks to some natural pauses and other improvements, Google says it is\nenabling a “more natural dialogue” with Assistant.\n\n**Related:[Google Home Mini\nreview](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-home-mini)**\n\nGoogle is also adding a new feature called Continued Conversation, which will\nenable users to have a “natural back and forth conversation,” rather than\nhaving to say “Hey Google” every single time and beginning a new request.\n\nSo, in the example used during the keynote, you could ask “Hey Google, did the\nWarriors win?”\n\nAnd then follow Assistant’s response with “When’s their next game?” From there\nyou could ask Assistant to set a reminder.\n\nThis understanding of context in follow-up questions will make it far easier\nfor users to interact with the Assistant. Alexa got the feature a few weeks\nback, so Google is merely catching up here.\n\nFinally, Google announced the Assistant can now handle threaded requests;.\n\nFor example, when asking “who was the Governor of California when Kevin Durant\nwas drafted and what team drafted him?”, Google will answer “Arnold\nSchwarzenegger Wass the governor in 2007. Kevin Durant was drafted by the\nSeattle Super Sonics.”\n\n## Say Please\n\nFinally, Google is also ensuring children retain their manners when talking to\nthe Assistant with the new “Pretty Please” feature, which will roll out next\nyear.\n\nAmid concern kids could learn to be bossy by making demands of AI, this will\nensure kids still have to ask nicely and say please when talking to their\nGoogle Home\n\n**Will you be picking John Legend to voice your Google Home?
