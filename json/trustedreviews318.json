I’m attaching the visual for you to\nsee.”\n\nWhile Leon’s comments have cast doubts over the Z4’s release, it is believed\nthe flagship phone will land in May follow a MWC unveiling, with a secondary,\nspin-off handset to launch later in the year.\n\nWith the leaks seemingly showing two variations of the phone, the first\n(above) looks markedly similar to its predecessors.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nAccompanied by the strapline “The Elemental – Xperia Z Fourth Generation”, the\nimage shows a slimline device with a centrally located, round power control.\n\nThe other handset looks all the more dramatic.\n\nAlthough the latest leaks have failed to offer any details on the Z4’s specs\nsheet, the images have suggested the phone will benefit from a mirrored front\nand back alongside a resin bezel and a 1.2mm thick glass panel.\n\nIt has also shown Sony’s cluttered device will be stripped back with just a\nsingle, large, square button featuring on the phones’ right-hand edge.\n\nIf that wasn’t enough, the hacked email has also given an advanced look at a\nnew, unnamed wrist-based wearable.\n\n**Related:** [Sony Xperia Z3 Compact\nreview](https://www.trustedreviews.com/sony-xperia-z3-compact-review)\n\nWith the James Bond Spectre set to hit cinemas on November 6, 2015, the teased\nZ4 spin-off release would fit happily with some top spy-themed marketing.\n\nThe leaked email added: “Barbara wants to get a PLACEMENT FEE for putting the\nphone in. She understands that Sony is willing to commit to a\nmarketing/advertising campaign of 18MM, but she wants an additional placement\nfee. In the past, Sony Electronics/Mobile has not paid a fee.”\n\n![Sony Xperia\nZ4](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)![Sony wearable\nleak](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n"}
