Let’s take a look.\n\n## **iPhone XS vs iPhone X – Design**\n\nAfter opting for a very similar overall design for its handsets for years, the\nchanges made with the iPhone X were obvious from first glance.\n\nIt ditched that chunky bezel, pushed the display right out to the corners, and\nreplaced the metal rear with one constructed from glass. Immediately, it felt\nlike a much more premium device that matched the new high price.\n\n**Related:[Best smartphones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nsmartphone-3431175)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n![iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max\nSpecs](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nHaving been through a radical design overhaul last time, Apple has decided to\nkeep with those changes with this new lineup of phones. There were rumours\nwe’d see a smaller ‘notch’ (the indent that juts in from the display) or\npossibly an even slimmer bezel, but neither of these has come to pass.\n\n**Related:[iPhone XR vs iPhone XS vs iPhone XS\nMax](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-xr-vs-iphone-xs-vs-iphone-xs-\nmax-3565104)**\n\nLike the iPhone X, the iPhone XS is constructed from a mixture of glass and\nstainless steel. New for the XS is a gold hue. Initial pictures suggest a\nfairly subdued gold colour covering the stainless steel band. You’ll be able\nto pick up the iPhone XS in black and silver, too.\n\nOther iPhone X design traits remain: the elongated lock switch, lack of a\nheadphone jack and IP67 water-resistance.\n\n## **iPhone XS vs iPhone X – Specs and features**\n\nAs is usual with ‘S’-series upgrades, the real differences come by way of the\nspecs and internal upgrades rather than visual differences.\n\nThe most significant of those is the switch to a new SoC – the silicon that\npowers the iPhone. While the iPhone X ran the A11 Bionic chip, the iPhone XS\nupgrades to the [A12\nBionic](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-a12-3462239). As is typical\nwith these improvements, Apple showed off multiple graphs detailing the speed\nimprovements that will be experienced when it comes to everyday performance\nand graphics. Gameplay shown during the event showed off improved shadows and\nvisuals.\n\nThis is a 7nm chip and, as such, efficiency will be better than that of the\n10nm A11 Bionic. Hopefully, this will lead to improved battery life without a\nknock-on effect on performance. Inside this new chip you’ll find a quad-core\nGP, a 6-core CPU and a dedicated neural engine.\n\n**Related:[Best iPhones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\niphone-3501342)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAnother upgrade that wasn’t specifically mentioned during the unveiling was\nRAM. But if the rumours are to be believed, the iPhone XS has 4GB of RAM,\nwhich is up from 3GB. We’ll likely have to wait until the iPhone XS is\navailable to buy to confirm the allocation.\n\nIt was with the iPhone X that Apple made the switch to OLED panels. Previous\niPhones, and even the iPhone 8 and [iPhone 8\nPlus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-8-plus), used LCD tech for\nits display. OLED tends to offer deeper colours, better contrast and perfect\nblacks. As such, you get a much richer experience whether you’re looking at\npictures or watching videos. The difference between the LCD on the iPhone 8\nPlus and the OLED on the iPhone X is apparent, showing off how much better the\ntech truly is.\n\n**Related:[iPhone XS vs Galaxy S9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-\nxs-vs-galaxy-s9-3564946)**\n\nApple has stuck with a 5.8-inch\n[OLED](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/oled-vs-qled-3530313) for the\niPhone XS and it has also introduced a second, larger model with a whopping\n6.5-inch OLED, the iPhone XS Max. Arguably, the biggest differentiator with\nthe new iPhone XS is the option to up the screen size.\n\nResolution remains the same at 2436 x 1125, and there’s still support for\nHDR10 and [Dolby Vision](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/dolby-\nvision-2942509), plus the wide P3 colour-gamut.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe iPhone XS is still home to a notch on the device’s display. This small\ncutout houses all the tech for the front-facing camera and the sensors\nrequired for [Face ID](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/face-id-3286453) to\nfunction. Of course, as is the case with the iPhone X, the only biometric\nmethod to unlock the iPhone XS is with your face. Apple said the Face ID\nsensor used here is faster in every way than the one used in the iPhone X.\n\n[iOS 12](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ios-12-3385158) was unveiled\nduring WWDC in June and it will come installed on all versions of the iPhone\nXS. iOS 12 doesn’t offer a huge overhaul for the software, but it does benefit\nfrom a couple of new features. These include much-improved notifications and a\nScreen Time feature that’s supposed to help you monitor your phone usage.\n\n**Related:[iPhone XR vs iPhone X](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-\nx-vs-iphone-xr-3562409)**\n\nBattery life is always difficult to gauge until we’ve properly tested and\nreviewed a device, plus as usual, Apple hasn’t specified the size of the cell\ninside the iPhone XS. It does say you’ll get 30 more minutes of use with the\niPhone XS when compared to the iPhone X.\n\n## **iPhone XS vs iPhone X – Camera**\n\nWhen it launched in 2017 the iPhone X camera was one of the best on the\nmarket. However, a year on and it feels like an update is needed. The\n12-megapixel f/1.8 main sensor is paired with a secondary 12-megapixel f/2.4\nsensor (both with OIS) and even though it takes good snaps, it can’t match the\nPixel 2.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nWith the iPhone XS, Apple is upgrading its camera system. It still has a dual\n12-megapixel sensor with f/1.8 aperture on the main wide-angle sensor and\nf/2.4 on the telephoto, but the sensors are completely new and there’s a new\nISP inside the A12 Bionic. There’s also a faster 7-megapixel selfie camera on\nthe front.\n\nThe biggest upgrades are in the software, though. There’s Smart HDR which\nimproves highlight details and shadows and the power of the A12 Bionic chip\nimproves post-processing. You can also finally alter the depth of the field\neffect after you’ve taken the photo.\n\nVideo on both phones can be captured at 4K, however the iPhone XS adds in\nstereo-sound recording.\n\n## **iPhone XS vs iPhone X – Price**\n\niPhones of past have never been cheap, but the iPhone X took things to the\nnext level. Prices for that device started at £999/$999 for the 64GB and rose\nto £1149/$1149 for the 256GB version – comfortably the most expensive iPhone\nto date.\n\nThe iPhone XS is the same price iPhone X, with prices starting at £999/$999\nfor the 64GB. £1149/$1149 for 256GB and £1449/$1449 for 512GB. That’s a\nseriously expensive iPhone.\n\n### Trusted Reviews Exclusive iPhone XS Deal\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n###\n\n[Apple iPhone XS – 10GB, £40pm with £350 upfront on O2\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\nGiving you plenty of data for the low price of just £40 a month, this monthly\ncontract with O2 is an incredible deal that can't be missed if you want to be\none of the first people to own an iPhone XS.\n\n[Mobiles.co.uk\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n|\n\n£350 upfront\n\n|\n\n£40/month\n\n[View\nDeal](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n£40/month\n\n|\n\n£350 upfront\n\n|\n\n[Mobiles.co.uk\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n## **Early verdict**\n\nAs is usual with ‘S’ upgrades, most of the changes here are internal rather\nthan visual. Considering the iPhone X was already an attractive device, this\nisn’t an issue here. The updates to the camera on the XS are welcome, as are\nthe improvements to speed. Nevertheless, we’ll have to fully review the iPhone\nXS before we can say for certain how much of an upgrade it really offers.\n\n"}
