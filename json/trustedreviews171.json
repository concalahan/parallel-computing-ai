It sat next to the\nlarger iPhone 8 Plus and premium iPhone X. It now sits below the brand-new\n[iPhone XS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xs) and the larger\n[iPhone XS Max](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xs-max), but\nit’s still sold by Apple.\n\nPrices now start from £599 (as opposed to £699) and it makes a good phone an\never better proposition. It’s also still the highest-end iPhone with what we’d\ncall a small screen. Finally, you’ll also benefit from speed and feature\nimprovements introduced with [iOS\n12](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ios-12-features-devices-3385158).\n\n### Trusted Reviews Exclusive iPhone XS Deal\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n###\n\n[Apple iPhone XS – 10GB, £40pm with £350 upfront on O2\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\nGiving you plenty of data for the low price of just £40 a month, this monthly\ncontract with O2 is an incredible deal that can't be missed if you want to be\none of the first people to own an iPhone XS.\n\n[Mobiles.co.uk\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n|\n\n£350 upfront\n\n|\n\n£40/month\n\n[View\nDeal](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n£40/month\n\n|\n\n£350 upfront\n\n|\n\n[Mobiles.co.uk\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n## **iPhone 8 price**\n\n_Prices for the iPhone 8 start at £599/$599 for 64GB and £749/$749 for 256GB._\n\n### The top iPhone 8 deals right now\n\n[](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3202&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-\nnewmobiledeals-\niphone8&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fcontract%2Fiphone-8-64gb-space-\ngrey%2Fee-essential-plan-15gb-43-24mths-24)\n\n[](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3202&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-\nnewmobiledeals-\niphone8&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fcontract%2Fiphone-8-64gb-space-\ngrey%2Fee-essential-plan-15gb-43-24mths-24)\n\n###\n\n[ iPhone 8 64GB Space Grey – 45GB of data on EE\n\n](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3202&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-\nnewmobiledeals-\niphone8&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fcontract%2Fiphone-8-64gb-space-\ngrey%2Fee-essential-plan-15gb-43-24mths-24)\n\nMore data than you can shake a stick at combined with absolutely nothing to\npay up front.

To get the best price, check out our[iPhone 8\ndeals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/iphone-8-deals-3260322) page._\n\n## **iPhone 8 – Design**\n\nVisually, the iPhone 8 is almost exactly the same as the [iPhone\n7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-7). It’s still your typical\nslab, with rounded corners and curved edges. The aluminium rear, which has\nbeen around since the iPhone 6, has been ditched for a glass panel here that\nfeels very similar to the front.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nThe switch to a glass rear is both for design purposes and functionality, but\nit’s immediately obvious just how much better it feels. Developed in\nconjunction with Corning, the glass is much grippier than aluminium and adds a\nnotable extra bit of weight. On the Plus model it feels too heavy, but here it\nworks perfectly. Sandwiched between the glass is the 7000-series aluminium\nrim, which is home to the volume rocker, antennas and lock switch.\n\n**Related:[Best\nsmartphone](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/trustedreviews-\nawards-2010-best-smartphone-page-25)**\n\n![iPhone 8\nback](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nMy one slight annoyance with the glass design is that it doesn’t _quite_ blend\ninto the aluminium rim as it did in previous models. There’s a notable lip\nbetween the end of the glass and the start of the metal, and my fingernail\noften gets caught in it. It’s a minor design quirk, however.\n\nThe obvious downside with glass is its fragility. The worry here is that a\ndrop that wouldn’t have left any lasting damage on the iPhone 7 will leave the\niPhone 8 with a seriously cracked rear. For instance, even though the Samsung\n[Galaxy S8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s8) is\nsupposed to benefit from tough Gorilla Glass 5, my device ended life as a\nglittering mess of glass shards after a 2ft drop onto a wooden floor. Apple\nclearly realises this is an issue, claiming the iPhone 8 has the ‘most durable\nglass ever in an iPhone’. My unit has been fine so far, but I haven’t put it\nthrough any rigorous drop-tests.\n\n**Related:[Apple Watch 4 review](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/apple-\nwatch-4)**\n\nI applaud Apple for switching to glass, but my overall view of the iPhone 8’s\ndesign is that it feels dull, predictable and quite some way behind Android\nflagships. The trend to trim the bezel surrounding the display – which\nprovides more screen in a smaller body – is coming to the iPhone X, but the\niPhone 8 still sports a sizeable bezel and fairly small screen.\n\nAt least Apple has ensured the iPhone 8 is still\n[IP67-rated](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/waterproof-phones-3286386)\nfor water-resistance, a feature that’s fast-becoming a prerequisite on\nflagship phones. It also retains the exceptional Taptic engine that provides\nthoroughly satisfying nudges and buzzes throughout the operating system.\n\n**Related:[Best iPhone 8 deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-\niphone-8-deals-3260322)**\n\n![iPhone 8 side\nfront](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nApple’s handsets remain my favourite when it comes to the colour choices\navailable. There are three colour options for the iPhone 8 – not the five of\nthe iPhone 7 – and the Gold is easily my favourite. This replaces the former\nGold option and Rose Gold; it’s an amalgamation of both. The glass on the rear\nof the device gives it a soft, almost ‘creamy’ vibe, and the sides are a less\nvivid pink. It’s appealing, but not all in the _Trusted Reviews_ ’ office\nshare this view. If Gold isn’t your thing then the iPhone 8 is available in\nSpace Grey and Silver too.\n\nIt’s been a year since Apple killed the headphone jack, and to absolutely no-\none’s surprise, it hasn’t made a triumphant return here. Having lived with an\niPhone 7 for many months now, I’ve become used to either picking up some\nwireless headphones or remembering to take the dongle – but it’s hardly ideal.\n\n**Related:[Best wireless\nheadphones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/wireless-headphones-\nbluetooth-3450127)**\n\n## **iPhone 8 – Screen**\n\nAt 4.7-inches, with a barely over-720p resolution, the display on the iPhone 8\ndoesn’t whip up much excitement. However, there is actually plenty to like\nhere, and the few changes Apple has made do make a noticeable difference in\nuse.\n\nThe main upgrade is True Tone, which first debuted on the [9.7-inch iPad\nPro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/ipad-pro-10-5). It’s a clever\nfeature that dynamically alters the display’s white balance depending on the\nenvironment you’re in. It’s like the Night Shift mode in iOS, but on a\nhardware level. It sounds minimal, but it really does work to soften the blue\ntones in the display, with the end result of being more comfortable on the\neyes.\n\nApple is also now supporting the [Dolby\nVision](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/should-you-next-tv-have-dolby-\nvision-2921025) and HDR10 formats, so you can play back HDR movies from iTunes\nand supported content from Netflix. Unlike the iPhone X, which Apple claims\nhas a ‘True HDR’ screen, the iPhone 8 doesn’t. Still, watching _Mad Max_ in\nHDR does look noticeably better than on the iPhone 7.\n\n**Related:[Best iPhone](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-iphone)**\n\n![iPhone 8\n](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nThe rest of the display specs remain the same as before. It’s still an IPS LCD\npanel; if you want the perfect blacks and more vivid colours of OLED, you’ll\nhave to plump for an iPhone X or an Android device.\n\nThe resolution can make photos look slightly grainy, but it remains one of my\nfavourite displays for colour reproduction, and the support for the DCI-P3\nwide colour gamut makes a huge difference in supported content. It also excels\nfor use in super-sunny conditions – an area in which OLEDs often suffer.\n\n[ Next  \nPerformance and Software\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-8-performance-and-software)\n\n"}
