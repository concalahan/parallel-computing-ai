But it also launched its biggest PCs\never, with its new MEK brand.\n\nHere are the details, plus four more mini PCs I saw at their booth on Tuesday.\n\n**Zotak MEK: Little tower PCs**\n\nThe first Zotac PC on this list is actually relatively large. The MEK is a\nMini-ITX designed tower PC (it can only stand up and can’t be laid flat) and\nit comes packing some impressive internals. The model on display at Computex\ncame equipped with Intel’s latest quad-core Core i7-7700 alongside one of\nZotac’s own tiny GTX 1080 Mini graphics cards. There’ll be NVMe-based SSDs,\ntwo DDR4 RAM slots and a tiny 450W SFX-form-factor PSU. They come in both\nwhite and black, and the LED strips will be customisable come launch. Expect\nto see these before Christmas.\n\n![Zotak\nMEK](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Zotac ZBox MA551: A Ryzen-powered multimedia box**\n\nThe MA551 certainly isn’t the most exciting looking PC Zotac’s built, and it’s\nalso quite a lot larger than its previous efforts. However, this living room\nPC comes with an as-yet undecided mid-range [AMD\nRyzen](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/amd-ryzen-specs-performance-\nrelease-date \"AMD Ryzen\") CPU, two DDR4 memory slots for up to 32GB of RAM,\nsix USB 3.0 ports and a front-mounted card reader. If you fancy an Intel\nmachine instead, the MI553 is identical but has kit from the Blue Team\ninstead.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n![Zptac\nMA551](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Zotac ZBox PI225: A PC the size of a battery pack**\n\nThis is Zotac’s smallest PC yet. It’s a tiny thing powered by Intel’s latest\nN3350 “Apollo Lake” Atom processor. You It’s powered over microUSB and can\nconnect to a 4K display via one of its two USB-C connectors. It’s just 10 x 6\nx 8cm in size, so be careful not to lose it down the back of your sofa.\n\n![Zotak\nPI225](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Zotac Zbox Magnus EN1050: eSports mini PC**\n\nZotac launched its GTX 1060-powered\n[EN1060](https://www.trustedreviews.com/zotac-zbox-magnus-en1060-review\n\"Magnus EN1060 review\") at least year’s Computex, and now the company is\nbringing the price down with one that comes with a cheaper, less powerful [GTX\n1050](https://www.trustedreviews.com/nvidia-geforce-gtx-1050-review \"GTX 1050\nreview\") on board instead. Zotac is trying to get the price into the region of\n£600, although whether that’s possible remains to be seen.\n\n![Zotac Zbox Magnus\n17](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Zotac Zbox Magnus ER1060 Gaming: A big mini gaming PC**\n\nZotac has modified its higher-end Zbox machines, getting rid of the more\nexpensive MXM-based graphics chips and instead using their own tiny graphics\ncards connected via a more standard PCIe connector, as you’d find in a regular\nPC.\n\n![Zbox\ner51060](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nFrom the outside it makes no difference and you can’t really see evidence of\nthe PCIe graphics chip unless you look around the back for the video out\nports. The older models were liquid cooled, but with the switch to PCIe,\nthere’s a single fan instead.\n\n**Are compact PCs your bag? Let us know what your ultimate mini desktop would\nbe.**\n\n"}
