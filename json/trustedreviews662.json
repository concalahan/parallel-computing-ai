Apple Watch Series 4 (or [Apple Watch\n4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-watch-4-release-date-price-\nspecs-3487177)) sees the line receive a welcome physical upgrade, a few more\nfitness-focused features and an electrocardiogram (ECG) monitor, too.\n\n## **Apple Watch 4 vs Apple Watch 3 – Design**\n\nThe [Apple Watch Series 3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/apple-\nwatch-3) looked almost identical to the ones that came before it. There were\nsome minor tweaks to the weight and thickness of the shell – mostly due to the\nadded LTE modem – but the general design was what we’ve come to expect from an\nApple wearable.\n\nFor the Apple Watch Series 4, that’s all changed. Apple has given the wearable\nits first significant design upgrade, and it looks a whole lot better for it.\nWhile the overall look feels familiar, the face has been stretched out nearly\nedge-to-edge to give a much larger panel. The Apple Watch Series 4 also comes\nin bigger sizes than previous editions: 40mm and 44mm as opposed to 38mm and\n42mm.\n\n**Related:[Best smartwatch](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nsmartwatch-3434307)**\n\nThe resolution of the panel has also received a boost, allowing more stuff to\nbe crammed on the screen at once. For instance, there’s a new watch face that\npacks in many more complications than before, allowing you to keep an eye on\nthe weather, music, fitness rings and more without having to switch faces or\napps.\n\nApple has updated a lot of its other watch faces too, allowing much more stuff\nto be visible. There are a couple of new faces, also, including a particularly\nneat-looking fire version.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n![Apple Watch 4 Fire\nface](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Related:[ iPhone XR, iPhone XS and iPhone XS\nMax](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-xs-release-date-specs-price-\nuk-3551351)**\n\nThe rest of the watch retains a familiar feel. There’s a Digital Crown on the\nside, with a quick-access button below. We haven’t yet held the watch for\nourselves, but it does appear to look slimmer and therefore lighter than\nprevious versions of the device. Apple did say you will now get a haptic\nresponse when you move the Crown, which should give a more mechanical feel via\nincremental clicks. Apple has also moved the microphone to the other side of\nthe speaker, to reduce echo for voice applications. The speaker gets an\nupgrade and is now 50% louder than on the previous generation.\n\nCharging is still via a magnetic clip that attaches to the bottom of the\nwatch, and the device will support AirPower – Apple’s wireless charging pad\nthat can also charge [Apple\nAirPods](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/airpods) and iPhones.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nEach Apple Watch to date has come in a variety of styles, whether in terms of\nstraps or the body. The Apple Watch Series 4 has the same strap mechanism of\nprevious Apple Watches, so straps you may already have are likely to fit just\nfine. Like the Apple Watch Series 3, the Series 4 comes in either an aluminium\nor stainless steel shell. Aluminium watches are available in silver, gold and\nspace gray. The stainless steel variety is available in silver, black and the\nnew gold.\n\n## **Apple Watch 4 vs Apple Watch 3 – Features**\n\nThe Apple Series 3 was a feature-packed wearable and remains one of the most\nfeature-rich watches.\n\nIt boasts the option of LTE for phone-free calling and music streaming;\nhowever, there’s a version without this capability too. In the UK, this LTE\nfunctionality has been restricted to EE thus far and, as such, it isn’t\nimmediately available to all. It’s far more widely adopted in countries such\nas the USA.\n\n**Related:[iPad Pro 2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ipad-\npro-2018-release-date-specs-price-3482812)**\n\nLTE remains an optional feature on the Apple Watch 4 and, once again, this is\nsignified by a red accent on the crown. This time around, the cellular version\nof the Watch 4 will be available through Vodafone as well as EE.\n\nBoth the Watch 3 and Watch 4 benefit from a generous number of sensors.\nThere’s GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, QZSS, a heart-rate monitor, accelerometer,\nambient light sensor and a gyroscope. The devices are also water-resistant, so\nyou can happily work up a sweat in the gym without worrying about any damage.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nApple says it has updated the accelerometer in the Series 4 and it can now\ndetect if you fall, notifying emergency services if it doesn’t sense movement\nafter.\n\nSomething new for the Apple Watch Series 4 is an ECG sensor. This will monitor\nthe electrical activity of your heart over a time period, feeding you the\nresults just by tapping your finger on the digital crown. The new watch will\nalso alert you if your heart rate falls below a certain level.\n\n**Related:[WatchOS 5](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-\nwatchos-5-3481152)**\n\nInside the new Apple Watch, you’ll find an updated S4 Chip. Apple says this is\n2x faster than the S3 from the Apple Watch Series 3 and it’s now a 64-bit\ndual-core processor.\n\nBattery life should, Apple says, remain the same as before. This means it\nshould last 18 hours, which Apple calls ‘all-day’. We’ll, of course, have to\nproperly test this when we get the new Apple Watch in for review.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## **Apple Watch 4 vs Apple Watch 3 – Price**\n\nDue to its range of different styles and strap options, the Apple Watch 3 was\navailable at a load of different prices. The most affordable versions, without\nLTE, start at £329 (38mm); the LTE range starts at £399 (38mm) and £429\n(42mm). This price rises all the way to £1349 for the priciest LTE ceramic\nvariety.\n\nThe Apple Watch 4 comes in a few different variations, including a new\npolished stainless steel and a shiny-looking gold. There will be aluminium\nones on sale too and these will come in silver, gold or space grey. Prices\nwill start at $399 for the GPS version and rise to $499 for the LTE-enabled\none. We’ll update this piece once we know UK pricing and other information on\nfurther prices for the various styles.\n\n## **Early Verdict**\n\nIf you’ve been hankering after a visual refresh for your Apple Watch, then the\nchanges in the Series 4 will no doubt go down well. The ECG sensor is a\nwelcome addition, too, once again demonstrating Apple’s focus on fitness for\nthese wearables. Still, we’ll need to spend a good amount of time with the new\nWatch 4 to see whether it’s really worth the upgrade.\n\n"}
