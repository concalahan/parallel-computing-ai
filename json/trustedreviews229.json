We\ngo behind the hype to see if your next TV or smartphone really should have\nDolby Vision.**\n\n[High dynamic range](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/hdr-tv-high-\ndynamic-television-explained-2927035) (HDR) video gets about as close to the\nclassic ‘good cop, bad cop’ routine as any AV technology ever will.\n\nOn one hand, it does more to improve picture quality than arguably any TV\npicture innovation since the development of colour. But on the other, the\narray of HDR formats and wide variances in how HDR looks on different TVs have\nmade it the most complex and frustrating technology the TV world has ever\nseen.\n\nDolby Vision could be the answer to the HDR conundrum. It is the HDR formats,\non paper at least, seems to be trying the hardest to make sure we all enjoy a\nmore uniform, more consistently impressive HDR performance.\n\nDolby Vision has actually been around for a while now, but it’s only recently\nthat it’s enjoyed widespread attention.\n\n![Dolby\nVision](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Dolby Vision: What is it?\n\nWe’ll keep this bit brief as, for many of us, the technology behind Dolby\nVision isn’t as interesting as the result.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nPut simply, the most important thing about Dolby Vision is that it adds a\nlayer of ‘dynamic metadata’ to a normal HDR video signal. This dynamic\nmetadata carries scene by scene instructions from content creators on how a TV\nshould present the images it’s receiving. Potentially, that improves\neverything from contrast to detailing and, especially, colour reproduction.\n\nThis is means that colours mapped with Dolby Vision tend to look richer, more\nnuanced, and better balanced compared to standard dynamic range footage.\nThings like shadow detail, colour finesse and black levels are all improved.\nOverall, the result is a more immersive experience, as you find yourself\ntaking in the HDR image as a whole, rather than focussing on stand-out peaks.\n\nBut there’s a catch…\n\n## Dolby Vision: What devices support it?\n\nUnlike HDR10, all devices that want to support Dolby Vision have to pay a\nlicensing fee to Dolby. At the time of writing, some manufacturers are willing\nto do this, while others are not.\n\nThe Dolby Vision-supporting TV brands to date in the UK are LG (with its high-\nend LCD and OLED TVs), Loewe (with its OLED TVs), and Sony with any of its\nmodels that carry X1 Extreme chips – though Sony’s TVs need an as yet\nundelivered firmware update to make Dolby Vision work.\n\nApple is also fully on the bandwagon, with the 4K [Apple\nTV](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/apple-tv-4k), alongside the [iPhone\n8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-8), [iPhone 8\nPlus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-8-plus) and the [iPhone\nX](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-x).\n\nThe two biggest TV brands to not currently offer Dolby Vision support are\nPanasonic and Samsung. Both manufacturers say that they believe they can get\nequally good HDR performance by applying their own picture processing and\nscreen technologies to a normal HDR10 video stream. They are pushing a\n‘dynamic metadata’ alternative to Dolby Vision, HDR10+.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n_Without Dolby Vision_ : _Colours are muted and focal point of the welding\ntorch is blown out_  \n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n_With_ _Dolby Vision:_ _Colours are richer and the sparks from the torch\nbrighter and better defined_\n\n## Dolby Vision: Does it really make a difference?\n\nWhile the way Dolby Vision works makes it tricky to do perfect-condition head\nto head comparisons, it certainly seems that Dolby Vision consistently\ndelivers a better result overall than the HDR10 industry standard. The extent\nof the improvement can vary from title to title, though, and the technology’s\nability to adapt to the specific capabilities of your TV isn’t absolutely\nbulletproof.\n\nStarting with 4K Blu-rays, I watched the two Despicable Me titles, Power\nRangers and The Fate Of The Furious in Dolby Vision using an Oppo 203 Ultra HD\nBlu-ray player and an LG OLED55C7 4K OLED TV. For HDR10 comparison, I played\nthe same discs into the same TV, but using a Panasonic UB900 4K Blu-ray\nplayer. Since this player doesn’t support Dolby Vision, it simply plays the\ntraditional HDR10 stream that’s also present on all Dolby Vision discs.\n\nWith all four titles the Dolby Vision difference is strong enough to be\nimmediately noticeable and persists with pretty much every frame of each\nmovie.\n\nColours, for starters, look more natural, more balanced, more detailed and,\nespecially in bright areas, more subtly blended. You can, for instance, see\nextra subtleties in the wallpapered walls of the bank of evil in Despicable\nMe, and there’s a greater range of tonal shading in the sun-drenched skin\ntones on show during The Fate Of The Furious’ Cuban scenes. Some shades\nactually look quite different in Dolby Vision – and I invariably felt that the\nDolby Vision tones looked more effective and natural than the HDR10 ones.\n\n![Graphic\n3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\n_This graphic shows the luminance range (brightness) of standard TV signals  \ncompared to Dolby Vision mastered footage. (Source: Dolby)_\n\nThe Dolby Vision image also handles light more effectively than the HDR10 one.\nThe brightest parts of the HDR image look more both punchier but also more\nfull of subtle detail than they do via the OLED55C7’s own management of HDR10.\nThere’s more finesse in dark picture areas too, making them look more detailed\nand natural, and overall the image’s light range seems to be both more extreme\nbut also more minutely managed.\n\nGreat examples of this improved light control are the scenes in Despicable Me\n1 in Gru’s lab as he first addresses his minions, and the gorgeous-looking\nshots in the main alien ship control room in Power Rangers.\n\nAdd this improved light control to the subtler colour handling and you’ve got\nan image that often looks strikingly three dimensional versus the flatter\nHDR10 experience, with an increased sense of solidity to objects in the image,\nand an enhanced sense of depth and space.\n\nThe extra light and colour refinement also makes the DV images look more\ndetailed and crisp, highlighting just how much precision can be lost when a TV\nis constantly having to ‘calculate’ how an HDR10 scene should look without any\nextra metadata information to help it out.\n\n![Dolby\nVision](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThese various Dolby Vision strengths have a much greater impact on the two\nDespicable Me titles and Power Rangers than I’d ever expected would be the\ncase. Going back to the HDR10 versions of these films after experiencing them\nin Dolby Vision feels almost like going back to HD after experiencing good\nquality 4K.\n\nDolby Vision doesn’t have quite so much impact with the Fate Of The Furious,\nbut it’s still beneficial – especially when it comes to bringing out more\ndetail refinement in all the gleaming metal and detailing of the film’s cars.\n\nPower Rangers and The Fate Of The Furious did also highlight one unexpected\nproblem with the OLED55C7’s Dolby Vision images, though. The thing is, OLED\ntechnology still has a problem with suddenly losing its usually spectacular\nblack level prowess if its brightness is pushed too high, and strangely the\nDolby Vision feed is much more likely to trigger this issue with the OLED55C7\nduring dark scenes than the HDR10 feed. Even with the screen’s brightness set\nto the same default 50 level.\n\nSo obvious can the sudden loss of black level be when watching Dolby Vision\nthat it really can be quite distracting – especially when, as occasionally\nhappens, the issue also reveals some minor vertical bands of light\ninconsistency.\n\n![LG C8](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nFortunately this DV/LG OLED issue only crops up occasionally during a typical\nfilm (and I didn’t really notice it at all during the Despicable Me films,\nperhaps because of their animated nature). You can also pretty much remove the\nproblem by reducing the TV’s brightness to around 46 from its 50 default.\nThough doing this reduces the image’s dynamism a little, and can lead to a\nlittle detail loss in the darkest areas.\n\nIt’s also true that to some extent this occasional greyness is ultimately down\nto a limitation of the TV. Given that part of Dolby Vision’s appeal, though,\nis its ability to get the very best out of whatever screen it’s being played\non, it seems unfortunate that its optimisation processes seem to have missed\nthe OLED brightness limitation that LG’s own internal HDR10 management seems\nto take into account.\n\nThe bottom line, though, is that overall and for the vast majority of the\ntime, Dolby Vision on Ultra HD Blu-ray is a surprisingly resounding success.\n\nTurning next to Dolby Vision on streamed video, I should start by pointing out\nthat I had to change the testing procedure quite a bit. After all, when a\nNetflix or Amazon stream detects that you’re using a Dolby Vision TV, it\nautomatically feeds you the Dolby Vision stream; you can’t opt to watch HDR10\ninstead. So I had to run Dolby Vision streams on the LG OLED55C7 alongside\nHDR10 streams of the same shows on a Samsung UE65KS9500.\n\nUsing a combination of Okja, Glow, Bosch 2 and Marco Polo, the good news is\nthat Dolby Vision again appears to deliver a noticeable improvement over\nHDR10. The picture once more exhibits more subtle colours, more sensitive\nlight control, more detail in the brightest areas, and a cleaner, clearer look\nto densely detailed areas such as those in the forest where we first meet\nOkja.\n\nI’d thought that maybe Dolby Vision could deliver a greater benefit with the\nreduced picture quality associated with streaming than it did with something\nas pristine as 4K Blu-ray. Actually, the opposite is true. There certainly\nstill seems to be some benefit in terms of overall image refinement, though.\n\nStrangely the Dolby Vision streams on the LG OLED TV looked noticeably less\nbright and dynamic than the HDR10 images on the Samsung set. It’s difficult to\nsay, though, how much of this is down to a deliberate ‘reining in’ decision by\nthe Dolby Vision system, and how much it’s down to the Samsung TV using\nbrighter LCD technology.\n\nWhile I can imagine some people preferring the more aggressive look of\nSamsung’s streamed HDR10 presentation, there’s no doubt that with all aspects\nof picture quality taken into account the Dolby Vision picture contains more\ninsight and finesse, and so may be preferable to the ‘enthusiast’ market.\n\nI should briefly mention a separate issue with streamed HDR content whereby\nsome titles, at least, look more natural in standard dynamic range than they\ndo in HDR. Recent release Glow, for instance, looks oddly fragile and washed\nout in HDR compared with the SDR image, while Bosch 2’s dark scenes tend to\nlook noisier and suffer reduced black level depth in HDR versus their SDR\ncounterparts. Okja, on the other hand, generally looks much superior in HDR.\n\nPotential issues with the way the streaming services master for HDR is a\ndiscussion for another day, though. The issue at hand here is whether Dolby\nVision delivers a better experience than HDR10. And the short answer is that\nyes, it does. In some cases dramatically so.\n\n**Related:[Best TV](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-tv-3440232)**\n\n## Dolby Vision vs HDR10: What’s the difference?\n\nWe’ve said in no uncertain terms that Dolby Vision is superior to HDR10, but\nwhy?\n\nThe main specification differences are that Dolby Vision masters of movies are\ndone at 12-bit, rather than HDR10’s 10 bits.\n\nAlso, peak brightness can go – in theory, at least – right up to 10,000\nlumens. In reality, most Dolby Vision masters seem to be targeting 4,000 nits\n– which remains a very big step up from the 1,000 nits that HDR10 masters work\nto.\n\nBut most significant is how Dolby Vision uses frame-by-frame metadata to\nmanage HDR performance. This helps to deliver the best results as it adapts\nthe source material to the performance of your TV.\n\nThis is why Dolby Vision requires the extra hardware we’ve talked about, and\nultimately why HDR10 and Ultra HD Premium are likely to be the more prevalent\nstandards. But the Dolby argument is this hardware will deliver better picture\nquality, and we agree.\n\nAnd, in case you were concerned, anything that supports Dolby Vision supports\nHDR10 by default, it just doesn’t work in the reverse.\n\n**Related:[Best 4K TV](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/4k-tv-3500597)**\n\n## Dolby Vision: Should your next TV support Dolby Vision?\n\nThis is a tricky one. Dolby Vision does, from all the evidence I’ve seen so\nfar, deliver a superior viewing performance to standard HDR10. So as more\nDolby Vision content turns up I can certainly imagine some, maybe many, AV\nfans only wanting to buy gear that supports it.\n\nThat said, it’s possible to buy TVs from the likes of Samsung and Panasonic\nthat deliver excellent quality from HDR10 alongside some unique picture\nfeatures – such as extreme colour volumes and ambient light management in\nSamsung’s QLED case, and Hollywood-tuned video processing in Panasonic’s OLED\ncase. Then there’s the HDR10+ format being pushed as an alternative to Dolby\nVision.\n\nAt this point it’s too early to say which format will ‘win’ and become more\nprevalent in the industry. That being said, if your TV or smartphone supports\nDolby Vision, take that as a good thing.\n\n"}
