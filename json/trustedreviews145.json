We delve into the particularities of\nthese two leading TV technologies.**\n\nTelevisions have never been better, or more exciting, than they are today.\nThis is partly because manufacturers have gone into competitive hyperdrive\nwith new features such as [4K Ultra\nHD](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/what-is-4k-2908860) and\n[HDR](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/hdr-tv-high-dynamic-television-\nexplained-2927035) (high dynamic range). But it’s also because we’re seeing a\nno-holds-barred scrap – driven by the intense rivalry between Samsung and LG –\nbetween two different television screen technologies.\n\nBoth make their pictures in very different ways, and both come with quite\ndistinct advantages and disadvantages. We’ll explain all of those differences\nhere.\n\n## OLED vs QLED – How OLED works\n\nOLED screens enable every pixel they contain to produce its own light. The\nclue to how they achieve this is in the technology’s full name: Organic Light\nEmitting Diode.\n\nEach pixel is made from organic materials that light up when charged with\nelectricity. The more electricity you apply to these organic materials, the\nbrighter they’ll glow, with different materials being used to deliver\ndifferent colours.\n\nSince each OLED pixel needs its own electric current to work, you end up with\na situation where every single pixel can work pretty much independently of\neven its nearest neighbours. This sort of pixel-level lighting precision has\nmade the technology a firm favourite of home cinema fans over recent years.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n![OLED vs\nQLED](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nOLED – LG C8\n\n## OLED vs QLED – How QLED works\n\nQLED is basically a fancy take on LCD TVs. The term itself recently underwent\na significant change in meaning.\n\nPrior to the CES in January 2017, QLED referred to future ‘self-emissive’ LED\ntechnology, where every pixel in an LED display makes its own light, similar\nto OLED screens. But then Samsung essentially (and controversially) rebranded\nQLED. Now, it refers to any TV that combines traditional LCD technology with\nQuantum Dots.\n\nQuantum Dots are an alternative to the filters LCD TVs usually employ to make\ncolour. They use an array of tiny dots of slightly different sizes that\nproduce different wavelengths (and therefore colours) when light is applied to\nthem.\n\nSince each tiny ‘dot’ is focused on just one colour, QDs can produce bolder\nbut also more precise colours than traditional filters. They can also make\nmore efficient use of any light that hits them than a typical filter, yielding\npotential energy consumption advantages.\n\nQLED TVs as they’re defined now still use external LED light sources to\nilluminate groups of pixels in normal LCD TV style.\n\n**Related:[Best TV 2018: The most amazing TVs you can\nbuy](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-tv-3440232)**\n\n![OLED vs\nQLED](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nQLED – Samsung Q9FN\n\n## OLED vs QLED – OLED advantages\n\n**1) Peerless black-level performance**\n\nSince every pixel in an OLED TV can make its own light, it’s possible to have\na perfectly black pixel sitting right alongside a maximum-brightness white\npixel.\n\nIt doesn’t take a leap of imagination to figure out that this individual\npixel-level light control has the potential to deliver much more contrast and\nimage light uniformity than any current LED solution.\n\nThis really comes into its own with today’s HDR sources, as it means HDR’s\nbrighter image highlights can be delivered without compromising any dark areas\nthat might be around them. There’s none of the general greying over of dark\nelements, or distracting light blooming or striping around bright elements,\nyou get with LED TVs (depending on the type of backlighting they use).\n\n**2) Beautiful contrast**\n\nBeing able to put deep black and bright white pixels beside each other without\nany compromise between the two has a stunning effect on a picture’s contrast.\nTorches flickering in a dark window, the moon in a night sky, stars in space,\nspotlights in dark buildings – all such picture elements enjoy a level of\nintensity on OLED screens that you just don’t get on any other current screen\ntechnology.\n\nSo pronounced can the difference in brightness be between the darkest and\nbrightest parts of an OLED screen’s images, in fact, that very extreme\ncontrast content can actually momentarily make OLED appear brighter than QLED.\n\n**3) Enhanced shadow detail**\n\nBeing able to control the light level of every pixel potentially enables OLED\nTVs to reveal subtle shades and details in the darkest corners of pictures\nthat can get ‘crushed’ out of QLED pictures.\n\nThis doesn’t always work out as you’d expect. Certainly many OLED TVs need\nquite carefully setting up to avoid crushing subtle detailing themselves. But\nthe principle is sound, and borne out in our head-to-head comparisons of real-\nworld TVs later.\n\n**4) Superior viewing angles**\n\nSince OLED TVs use self-emissive pixels, their pictures can be viewed from a\nmuch wider angle than those of QLED TVs before they start losing any\nsignificant colour and contrast.\n\nThis is clearly a big deal if your viewing room requires anyone to sit off\ndown near the sides of the screen.\n\n**5) Unlocks the dark end of what HDR can do**\n\nWhile some refer to the introduction of HDR as creating a brightness race\nwhere TVs are concerned, the reality is that HDR is as much about the dark end\nof the light spectrum as the bright end. So while QLED can certainly put on a\nlight show with HDR’s bright stuff, OLED is better equipped to unlock all that\nextended dark scene detail HDR can carry.\n\n![OLED vs\nQLED](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nOLED – LG likes to make walls and tunnels with its TVs\n\n## OLED vs QLED – QLED advantages\n\n**1) Really bright**\n\nFor decades, brightness wasn’t really a big deal in the TV world. The old\n‘Rec. 709’ video standard just didn’t put much store in it. The arrival of HDR\nvideo, though, has suddenly put brightness on the TV map.\n\nQLED TVs can run far more brightly than current OLED TVs. For instance, the\n65-inch [Samsung Q9FN](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-q9fn-\nqled) can pump out a peak measured light output (on a white HDR window filling\n10% of the screen) of 2400 nits.\n\nThe recently tested [Hisense\n75U9A](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/hisense-h75u9a) Quantum Dot TV,\nmeanwhile, punched in at 2700 nits with the same test signal. OLED TVs, by\ncomparison, have yet to break the 1000-nit barrier.\n\n**2) More colour volume**\n\nColour volume is the name given to measurements of colour at varying levels of\nbrightness. So it kind of goes without saying that since QLED TVs can hit much\nhigher brightness levels than OLED ones, they deliver measurably more of the\nsorts of colour volumes we see in the real world.\n\n**3) More lifelike HDR content**\n\nHDR video is currently defined as being capable of hitting peak brightness\noutputs of 10,000 nits. Most HDR content to date is mastered to peaks of\n1000-4000 nits (or less). But this still provides plenty of breathing room for\nthe brightness of QLED TVs to deliver much more of the sort of impact – at\nleast during bright scenes – that HDR is designed to reproduce.\n\nAs well as delivering a bigger picture quality ‘jump’ from standard dynamic\nrange to HDR during bright scenes, this extra brightness means that QLED\nscreens can make HDR pictures look more lifelike. After all, one of the points\nof HDR is to enable screens to reproduce more of the light levels our eyes\nwitness in the real world every day.\n\n**4) Immune to screen burn**\n\nSince QLED TVs don’t use organic elements, they are essentially immune to\nscreen burn/image retention, whereby prolonged exposure to a particularly\nbright static image element – a channel logo, say, or part of a game HUD – can\neventually leave a permanent shadow of that image element behind.\n\nOLED TVs have improved greatly in this respect in recent years, and you can\nmitigate the risks of screen burn by taking care how you use an OLED screen –\nespecially in the first 100 hours of its life. But this still isn’t as good as\nbeing immune to the issue like QLED screens are.\n\n**5) Easier/cheaper to manufacture**\n\nOLED TVs are notoriously difficult to make, meaning that panel yields were\nuntil recently low. This has tended to result in prices that have remained\nstubbornly high. QLED technology, by comparison, can be relatively\nstraightforward to manufacture, costing only a small premium over standard LED\nTVs.\n\nIt should be stressed, though, that chief OLED manufacturer LG has started to\nmake great strides with OLED production efficiencies lately – and OLED prices\nhave finally started to shift significantly downwards as a result. Also,\nadvanced QLED approaches, such as the metal-clad QDs in Samsung’s QLED TVs,\ncan actually be quite expensive to produce.\n\n**Related:[Sony ZF9 vs Samsung Q9FN](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/sony-\nzf9-vs-samsung-q9fn-3527002)**\n\n![OLED vs\nQLED](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nQLED – Samsung shows it’s not afraid of bright rooms\n\n## OLED VS QLED – Which is better?\n\nTrying to simply pick OLED over QLED or vice versa is a fool’s errand. The\nbottom line is that they both excel in different ways. And so they both suit\ndifferent types of viewing conditions and picture preferences.\n\nIf you’re looking for a TV for a bright room, or something to give you the\nmost consistent dynamism from HDR content, the top-end, direct-lit QLED TVs\nare the way to go. They’re brighter, deliver more ‘real-world’ colour volume,\nhandle ambient light better and are immune to screen burn issues.\n\nFor darker conditions, though – at least for the sort of AV fans who value\nblack-level depth and dark detailing over brightness – LG’s OLED TVs are the\nway to go. That is particularly the case if your room layout routinely\nrequires someone to have to watch the TV from much of an angle.\n\nEither way, my biggest takeaway from putting this article together is that\nanyone buying a TV in 2018 should feel very happy indeed to have such choices.\n\n"}
