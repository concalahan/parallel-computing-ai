But Sony may just have provided us with an answer inthe shape of its upcoming ZF9 series.**Sony ZF9 vs Samsung Q9FN: Recently unveiled in New York, the Sony ZF9 is theeagerly awaited successor to Sony’s much-loved ZD9. They use the same keytechnology of a direct backlighting system with hundreds of zones of localdimming. Aside from that – as we’ve already discussed in our separate [SonyZF9 vs ZD9]()Samsung Q9FN## Sony ZF9 vs Samsung Q9FN – HDR formatsThe Samsung and Sony sets differ, too, on the HDR formats they support. Bothhandle the industry-standard HDR10 and broadcast-friendly HLG systems. Butwhile the ZF9 supports the Dolby Vision ‘premium’ HDR format with its extralayer of scene-by-scene data, the Q9FNs support HDR10+. This is a new rival toDolby Vision, developed predominantly by Samsung.There isn’t enough HDR10+ content out there yet to form a conclusion as towhich format delivers the best results. And the fact that there are alreadydozens of Dolby Vision streams and 4K Blu-rays available to watch at homemeans Sony’s HDR horse is off to a flyer. But the first HDR10+ 4K Blu-raysfrom 20th Century Fox are incoming soon, and all of Amazon’s HDR TV shows arealready streaming in HDR10+.The final comparison to make between the ZF9 and Q9FN is their smart systems.During its demonstration of the upcoming ZF9, Sony gave us a tantalisingglimpse of the new Android Oreo system. This looked far superior to pastAndroid TV interfaces: less cluttered, more intuitive and with a greaterunderstanding of the stuff TV owners want their smart systems to be focusedon.The Samsung Q9FN uses Samsung’s own Eden smart platform. And a very goodsystem this is too: well organised, slick, easy to customise and rich incontent. I suspect it may still have the edge over the Oreo version of Android– but at least I look forward to trying out Oreo much more than I did spendingtime with any previous Android TV system.We’ll be bringing you a review of a Sony ZF9 as soon as the TV launches inautumn 2018. For now, here’s our [SamsungQ9FN](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-q9fn-qled) review."}
