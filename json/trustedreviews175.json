We’ve tested every part we could find and\nscoured stores to find the best deals for builds to suit five main budgets:\n£600, £800, £1000, £1500 and £2000.\n\nWe rigorously benchmarked all the parts on our test bench to ensure you’re\ngetting the best gaming PC build for everything from casual gaming to hardcore\n4K fragging.\n\n**Related:[Best motherboards](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nmotherboard)**\n\n## Best Gaming PC 2018: What’s new?\n\nThe first wave of [Nvidia’s RTX 20 Series graphics\ncards](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/nvidia-geforce-rtx-2080-specs-\nprice-2952823) are finally here, with the RTX 2080 now available to buy. That\ndoesn’t mean you should rush to the store and grab one just yet though, as\nwe’re still awaiting the release of the RTX 2070 and 2080 Ti, which could\npotentially better suit your needs.\n\nWhile the new generation of graphics cards reportedly offer a sizeable boost\nto 4K visuals, it’s the real-time ray tracing tech that is seemingly the most\nexciting update, which Nvidia claims will dramatically improve light effects\nin supported video ames. While we’ll have to wait a few months for software\nsupport and the list of compatible games to grow, it’s still a very exciting\nfeature to keep in mind when building your rig. Plus, the launch of the new\ngraphics cards will likely trigger a price cut for the current range of GPUs.\n\nAs well as new graphics cards, [Intel’s 9th Gen\nCPUs](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/intel-9th-gen-cpu-release-date-\nspecs-3501382) are also expected to be arriving shortly. Rumours suggest that\nthe Core i9-9900K will offer a noticeably slicker performance compared to last\nyear’s equivalent, as [YouTuber Lau Kin\nLam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6MnSsD9UUI&feature=youtu.be) posted a\nvideo that claimed the new high-end processor scored a benchmark rating of\n2166 in Cinebench.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nAnd of course, a new generation of CPUs will inevitably be followed by a wave\nof Intel 9th Gen-compatible motherboards too. We did warn you that it’s not a\ngreat time buy PC components. If you want the best gaming PC rig possible, we\nsuggest you wait a few weeks and look to Trusted once we’ve reviewed all the\nnew GPUs, CPUs motherboards and more. Can’t wait that long?

It runs at a decent clock\nspeed, boasts four cores and its overclockable so there’s room to eek out more\nperformance. It also comes with a cooler included.\n\nWhat’s more, going with the 2200G means you can potentially put off buying a\nseparate graphics card, if you really are on a tight budget, thanks to its\nonboard graphics. It will be a significantly slower machine until you do\nupgrade the graphics, but it’ll still get you 60fps+ in several eSports\ntitles.\n\nThe rest of this build is about as basic as it gets but there are two crucial\nadditions. Instead of a hard drive it uses an SSD so your PC will boot and\nload games faster. This makes storage space limited but, if you have any, you\ncan always reuse older hard drives for storing bulk data.\n\nMeanwhile, when it comes to that separate graphics card, the [GTX\n1050](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-gtx-1050) is a\nreally powerful card for the price, and it positively sips power. With it, you\ncan game comfortably at up to 1080p resolutions at Low-Medium settings on AAA\ngames, and higher on eSports titles.\n\n**Potential swaps:** The most obvious potential swap is dropping the SSD and\nopting for a hard drive instead. This will get you much more space to store\nall your files, but your PC will be slower at booting up, loading apps and\ncopying files. Crucially, games won’t be any slower – slower to load, but not\nslower to run.\n\nOtherwise, there’s very little you can do to this build to save more money,\napart from buying second-hand gear or compromising more on graphics power.\nAllow yourself an extra £100 to spend and you can get both a slightly larger\nSSD and a hard drive.\n\n**Video: Intel Core i models explained  \n**\n\n# VR-ready PC – Best Gaming PC for £800 ($900)\n\n[Oculus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/oculus-rift-review) provides an\noptimum spec for a PC that will provide a great VR experience, but it’s long\nsince been superseded, so this is our recommended build instead:\n\nComponent | Name | UK Price | UK Supplier | US Price | US Supplier  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nCPU | AMD Ryzen 3 2200G | £90 |\n[Overclockers.co.uk](https://www.overclockers.co.uk/amd-ryzen-3-2200g-vega-\ngraphics-am4-cpu-w-wraith-stealth-cooler-cp-3ab-am.html) | $99 |\n[Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/AMD-Ryzen-Processor-Radeon-\nGraphics/dp/B079D3DBNM/)  \nMotherboard | Gigabyte B450M-DS3H | £70 |\n[Overclockers.co.uk](https://www.overclockers.co.uk/gigabyte-b450m-ds3h-amd-b450-socket-\nam4-ddr4-micro-atx-motherboard-mb-571-gi.html) | $79 |\n[Newegg.com](https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813145083)  \nRAM | Corsair Vengeance 8GB 2666MHz, 2 x 4GB | £80 |\n[Overclockers.co.uk](https://www.overclockers.co.uk/corsair-vengeance-\nlpx-8gb-2x4gb-ddr4-pc4-21300c16-2666mhz-dual-channel-kit-red-\ncmk8gx4m2a2666c1-my-453-cs.html) | $90 |\n[Newegg.com](https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820233827)  \nGraphics card | GeForce GTX 1060 3GB | £210 |\n[Overclockers.co.uk](https://www.overclockers.co.uk/evga-geforce-\ngtx-1060-3072mb-gddr5-pci-express-graphics-card-gx-30d-ea.html) | $280 |\n[Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/EVGA-GeForce-GAMING-\nSupport-06G-P4-6163-KR/dp/B01IPVSLTC/)  \nSSD | Crucial MX500 250GB | £55 |\n[Scan.co.uk](https://www.scan.co.uk/products/250gb-crucial-mx500-25-ssd-sata-\niii-6gb-s-sm2258-3d-tlc-nand-read-560mb-s-write-510mb-s-95k-90k-iops) | $59 |\n[Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-MX500-250GB-NAND-\nInternal/dp/B0781VSXBP/)  \nHDD | WD Blue 1TB HDD | £38 | [Amazon.co.uk](https://www.amazon.co.uk/WD-TB-\nPC-Hard-Drive/dp/B0088PUEPK/) | $44 |\n[Newegg.com](https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIABZ053G6556)  \nPower Supply | Corsair VS450 | £35 |\n[Scan.co.uk](https://www.scan.co.uk/products/corsair-450w-vs450-fully-\nwired-80-plus-white-single-rail-36a-120mm-fan-atx-psu) | $35 |\n[Newegg.com](https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817139230)  \nCase | BitFenix Neos | £35 |\n[Overclockers.co.uk](https://www.overclockers.co.uk/bitfenix-comrade-midi-\ntower-black-windowed-ca-182-bx.html) | $41 |\n[Newegg.com](https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811345091)  \nCooler | Included with CPU | £0 |  | $0 |  \nSoftware | Windows 10 | £120 | [Microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-\ngb/store/d/product/D76QX4BZNWK4/1NT3) | $120 |\n[Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Windows-Home-Flash-\nDrive/dp/B01019T6O0/)  \n| Total: | £733 |  | $847 |  \n  \nAMD Ryzen 3 is the CPU of choice for our £800, VR-ready build, with the 2200G\nagain being our choice. Elsewhere, we’ve also stuck with the same motherboard\nas our cheaper build but there’s now budget for a hard drive as well as a\nlarger, faster SSD.\n\nWe also thought it about time to leave behind the RX 570 graphics card that\nwe’ve been recommending. It was the direct upgrade to the RX 470 that Oculus\nrecommends but it’s so expensive for the performance it provides. The GTX 1060\n3GB is significanty faster and a bit cheaper too.\n\nIn our opinion, this is the best gaming PC you can build for the money, both\nfor VR and gaming at Full HD resolutions on a conventional monitor.\n\nBear in mind, though, if you’ve got an [HTC Vive\nPro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/vive-pro), you’ll want a GPU\nthat’s equivalent to or better than the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070, while your\nmotherboard will need a DisplayPort.\n\n![Best Gaming PC - Oculus\nRift](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Potential swaps:** This build is ripe for upgrades with the case, CPU\ncooler, SSD and hard drive all being about as low as you can go, so spending\nan extra £30-£50 on any of those would be worthwhile – see our pricier builds\nfor what to go for.\n\nOtherwise, if you want to save a nice chunk of money you could go for the GTX\n1050, but that would mean quite a large compromise on graphics performance,\nand of course you’ll no longer be up to spec for VR gaming.

We’ve also jumped up to a sizable 500GB SSD and a snazzier\ncase – it’s an all-round upgrade from our £800 build.\n\nThis is also true when it comes to the graphics card. While it’s still a GTX\n1060, we’ve opted for the 6GB version. It doesn’t have a tonne more\nperformance but is better suited to higher resolutions and detail settings.\n\nIt would be tempting to jump up to the GTX 1070, but it’s just too big a leap\nin price right now.\n\nThis spec of machine is ideal for gaming comfortably at 1440p at 60Hz or\ngetting 120fps+ in 1080p games.\n\n**Watch: Nvidia GTX 1070 review**\n\n**Potential swaps:** There’s very little here that’s obviously lacking.

A six-\ncore chip, with overclocking and that runs at 3.6-4.3GHz, it should be all the\nCPU most users ever need.\n\nThe rest of the build is much the same as our £1000 build other than a\nmotherboard upgrade and the leap to the GTX 1070 graphics card. Not that long\nago we were listing the GTX 1080 for this build but with graphics card prices\nstill high, we’ve had to drop down to the GTX 1070. It won’t always deliver\nquite the smoothness of performance at 4K as the GTX 1080 but will be close\nenough most of the time.\n\nA fast Samsung 970 Evo SSD will keep boot-up, app startup and file transfer\ntimes to a minimum, while you’ve plenty of budget for a big 3TB hard drive for\nall your bulk data.\n\n**Watch: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 review  \n**\n\n**Potential swaps:** The obvious upgrade here is to jump back up to the GTX\n1080 but it’s worth bearing in mind what monitor you’ll be using. If you’re\nonly really gaming at 1080p, a GTX 1080 is unnecessary – there’s a reason we\ncall this the 4K build.\n\nMeanwhile, if multi-thread performance is particularly important to you, then\nyou could swap the Intel CPU and motherboard for the Ryzen 7 2700 and an AMD\nmotherboard such as the [Asus Prime\nX370-Pro](https://www.overclockers.co.uk/asus-prime-x370-pro-amd-x370-socket-\nam4-ddr4-atx-motherboard-mb-69f-as.html).\n\nIf you want a tidier-looking build then you could replace the large Noctua CPU\ncooler for a more compact all-in-one liquid cooler such as the Corsair H110i.\nIt’s louder and slightly more expensive, but it will keep the CPU even cooler\nas well as freeing up space inside your case.\n\n![Best Gaming PC - Asus Maximus VIII\nHero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n# The Workstation – Best gaming PC for £2000 ($2100)\n\nComponent | Name | UK Price | UK Supplier | US Price | US Supplier  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nCPU | AMD Ryzen 7 2700X | £286 | [Amazon.co.uk](https://www.amazon.co.uk/AMD-\nRyzen-8-Core-Wraith-Cooler/dp/B07B428M7F/) | $320 |\n[Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/AMD-Ryzen-Processor-Wraith-\nCooler/dp/B07B428M7F/)  \nMotherboard | Gigabyte X470 Aorus Gaming | £135 |\n[Overclockers.co.uk](https://www.overclockers.co.uk/gigabyte-x470-aorus-ultra-\ngaming-amd-x470-socket-am4-ddr4-atx-motherboard-mb-56z-gi.html) | $160 |\n[Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/MSI-X370-GAMING-PRO-CARBON/dp/B06WGS4FJL/)  \nRAM | Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB 3000MHz | £159 |\n[Overclockers.co.uk](https://www.overclockers.co.uk/corsair-vengeance-\nlpx-16gb-2x8gb-ddr4-pc4-24000c15-3000mhz-dual-channel-kit-black-\ncmk16gx4m2b30-my-445-cs.html) | $150 |\n[Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-Vengeance-3000MHz-Desktop-\nMemory/dp/B0134EW7G8/)  \nGraphics card | MSI GTX 1080 Ti | £690 |\n[Overclockers.co.uk](https://www.overclockers.co.uk/evga-geforce-gtx-1080ti-\nsc2-gaming-icx-11264mb-gddr5x-pci-express-graphics-card-11g-p4-6593-kr-\ngx-312-ea.html) | $710 |\n[Newegg.com](https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814487336)  \nSSD | Samsung 970 Evo 500GB | £170 |\n[Overclockers.co.uk](https://www.overclockers.co.uk/samsung-970-evo-\npolaris-500gb-m.2-2280-pci-e-3.0-x4-nvme-solid-state-drive-hd-23n-sa.html) |\n$148 | [Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-970-EVO-500GB-\nMZ-V7E500BW/dp/B07BN4NJ2J/)  \nHDD | Toshiba 3TB HDD | £69 |\n[Amazon.co.uk](https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Internal-Hard-\nDrives/Toshiba-P300-7200RPM-SATA-Hard-Drive-bulk/B0151KM6F0/) | $77 |\n[Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Desktop-7200rpm-Internal-\nDrive/dp/B013JPLOQQ/)  \nPower Supply | Corsair TX650M 80 Plus Gold | £99 |\n[Overclockers.co.uk](https://www.overclockers.co.uk/corsair-\ntx650m-650w-80-plus-gold-semi-modular-power-supply-cp-9020132-uk-\nca-234-cs.html) | $105 |\n[Newegg.com](https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIAD6H5US6287)  \nCase | NZXT S340 | £69 | [Amazon.co.uk](https://www.amazon.co.uk/NZXT-\nCA-S340MB-GR-Source-Midi-Tower/dp/B00RN3SJW8/) | $73 |\n[Newegg.com](https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811146190&cm_re=NZXT_S340-_-11-146-190-_-Product)  \nCooler | Noctua NH-U12S SE-AM4 | £71 |\n[Overclockers.co.uk](https://www.overclockers.co.uk/noctua-nh-d14-dual-\nradiator-cpu-cooler-hs-011-nc.html) | $75 |\n[Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/Noctua-NH-D14-Heatpipe-Radiator-\nBearing/dp/B002VKVZ1A/)  \nSoftware | Windows 10 | £120 | [Microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-\ngb/store/d/product/D76QX4BZNWK4/1NT3) | $120 |\n[Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Windows-Home-Flash-\nDrive/dp/B01019T6O0/)  \n| Total: | £1,868 |  | $1,938 |  \n  \nOur £1,750-£2,000 AMD Ryzen/Workstation build is all about the huge multi-core\npower of the AMD [Ryzen 7 2700X](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/amd-\nryzen-7-2700x) CPU. Its 8-core/16-thread configuration provides masses of\nprocessing for a fantastic proce.\n\nWe’ve paired it with the feature-packed Gigabyte X470 Aorus Gaming motherboard\nand 16GB or RAM. It would be tempting to get 32GB but RAM prices are just too\nhigh at the moment to justify 32GB for most users.\n\nMeanwhile, if you were wondering about both\n[AMD](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/amd-threadripper-release-date-price-\nspecs-3231747) and [Intel](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/intel-\ncore-i9-specs-release-date-skylake-x-2948774)‘s new ultra-high-end\nThreadripper and Skylake X CPUs they’re both overkill for most users. The only\nreason most will want to consider them is if you’re building a PC with\nmultiple graphics cards, and that’s mega-bucks territory.\n\nThe rest of this system is based on our £1500 gaming PC build with a fast main\nSSD and a secondary hard drive for bulk data, plus a quality power supply and\ncase. We’ve swapped out the CPU cooler for one that’s a tad beefier to cope\nwith the 2700X’s extra heat output.\n\nWe’ve chosen the Nvidia GTX 1080 Ti graphics so as to deliver one of the best\ngaming performance available right now. Only Nvidia’s 20 Series GPUs can beat\nit, but we’re yet to give them a thorough testing, so we not yet able to\ndetermine whether the RTX 2080 represents a better buy.\n\n**Potential swaps:** If you’re after even more of a workstation-type build\nthen you may want to swap back to the 32GB of RAM and get a slower graphics\ncard but otherwise the main consideration here is whether to swap to an Intel\nCPU. The [Intel Core i7-8700K](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/intel-\ncore-i7-8700k) is the ultimate gaming CPU right now – until Intel releases its\n9th Gen CPUs – but with this build we wanted something of a balance between\ngaming and multi-core workstation workloads.\n\nThe other alternative is to drop things down a gear by opting for the [AMD\nRyzen 7 2700](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/amd-ryzen-7-1700). This\nchip still gets you eight-core performance but for just £250. Similarly, drop\nthe motherboard to a £120 MSI X370 SLI Plus and go for a GTX 1070 and you’ll\nhave a multi-core workstation build for around £1500 that’s still mighty good\nfor gaming – especiallly if you do a bit of overclocking.\n\n"}
