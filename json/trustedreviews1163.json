But is it the best value buy in this Nvidia RTX 2080 vs GTX\n1080 face-off?**\n\nThe [RTX 2080](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/nvidia-geforce-\nrtx-2080-specs-price-2952823) – the top card in the lineup bar the RTX 2080 Ti\n– is a rather more specific generational shift than we saw with the [Nvidia\nGTX 1080](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-gtx-1080). The\nnew architecture focuses on real-time ray tracing and AI-based graphical\nenhancement, but comes comes with a fairly intimidating price hike.\n\nGame engines will need to use these features to make Nvidia’s claims of ‘6x\nperformance’ increases anything like a reality. But real-time ray tracing will\ncertainly have a big impact on the kinds of improved graphical effects we’ll\nsee in games over the next 18 months.\n\nBefore real-time ray tracing support arrives though, the RTX 2080’s\nperformance boost should still please owners. Reports suggest that the new\ncard is capable of running 4K games in 60 frames per second. We’re yet to test\nthat out for ourselves, but if the reports are true, Ultra HD gamers will\nsurely be tempted to upgrade.\n\nLet’s compare the Nvidia RTX 2080 to the GTX 1080 to whether it’s worthy of\nall the excitement.\n\n**Related:[Nvidia RTX 2080](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/nvidia-\nrtx-2080-specs-price-2952823)**\n\n## Nvidia RTX 2080 vs GTX 1080 – Overview\n\nTime flies when you spend half your free time looking for a graphics card\ndeal, apparently. Nvidia announced the GTX 1080 way back in May 2016; it went\non sale towards the end of that month.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThe Nvidia RTX 2080 was announced more than two years later on 20 August 2018,\nas part of the Gamescom conference. It’s on sale right now.\n\nNvidia says it’s worked on the Turing architecture for 10 years. An important\nelement of this new style of GPU, the Tensor core, was also used in 2017’s\nTitan V and Tesla V100 cards.\n\nThe V100 is a £10,000 card intended for engineers and data scientists. This\nRTX generation sees a tasty trickle-down of technology, which before now was\njust too expensive for most of us to afford.\n\n**Related:[Best gaming PC](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/best-gaming-\npc-2993099)**\n\n![Nvidia RTX 2080 vs GTX\n1080](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Nvidia RTX 2080 vs GTX 1080 – Price\n\nNvidia’s RTX 2080 is far from an ‘affordable’ component, however. The\noverclocked Founders Edition of the RTX 2080 costs £749/$799, and there’s a\n£649 ‘RRP’ for future third-party cards.\n\nThis is significantly more expensive than the initial £619 price of the GTX\n1080 back in May 2016. It’s much closer to the original cost of the [GTX 1080\nTi](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-gtx-1080-ti).\n\nAt the RTX 2080’s launch, online prices for the GTX 1080 were down to the\n£450-500.\n\nThe hope now is that we won’t see another shortage-induced price hike over the\ncoming months, caused by Bitcoin miners hogging the supply.\n\n**Related:[Best graphics card](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\ngraphics-card-3431869)**\n\n## Nvidia RTX 2080 vs GTX 1080 – Performance\n\nWe’re yet to get our hands on a Nvidia RTX 2080, so can’t provide our own\nbenchmarks or thoughts on the new graphics card’s performance. However, Nvidia\nhas provided some benchmarks scores of various games playing in 4K to get an\nidea of how it compares to the GTX 1080.\n\nNote that Nvidia used the same testing rig for the two graphics cards, with\nthe specs listed below:\n\n  * **Processor:** Intel Core i9-7900X 3.3GHz CPU\n  * **RAM:** 16GB Corsair DDR4\n  * **Motherboard:** Asus X299 Rampage VI Apex\n  * **OS:** Windows 10 (v1803) 64-bit\n  * **Nvidia drivers:** 411.38\n\nNvidia also confirmed that it used its own testing process to achieve these\nscores. What’s most important here, though, is the difference in performance\nbetween the two graphics cards rather than the isolated scores.\n\n| **GTX 1080** | **RTX 2080** | **RTX 2080 vs GTX 1080**  \n---|---|---|---  \nBattlefield 1 (SDR) | 52.5 | 72.3 | +37.7%  \nBattlefield 1 (HDR RGB444) | 48.9 | 72.2 | +47.8%  \nBattlefield 1 (HDR YUV422) | 44.2 | 73.0 | +65.4%  \nCall of Duty: WWII (SDR) | 66.0 | 104.2 | +57.8%  \nCall of Duty: WWII (HDR RGB444) | 66.4 | 100.5 | +51.3%  \nCall of Duty: WWII (HDR YUV422) | 59.7 | 95.7 | +60.3%  \nF1 2018 (SDR) | 51.8 | 72.0 | +39.1%  \nF1 2018 (HDR RGB444) | 51.1 | 72.8 | +42.4%  \nF1 2018 (HDR YUV 442) | 46.5 | 72.8 | +56.5%  \nPlayerUnknown’s Battleground | 46.3 | 61.6 | +33.0%  \nShadow of the Tomb Raider | 31.7 | 47.1 | +48.6%  \nWitcher 3 | 43.3 | 61.5 | +42.0%  \n  \n**Related:[Best motherboard](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nmotherboard)**\n\nNoticeably, the more visually demanding games listed above see performance\nincreases floating around the 50% mark, which is seriously impressive if true.\nVarious reports suggest the RTX 2080 is able to render 4K games at 60 frames\nper second too, something that the GTX 1080 is definitely not capable of.\n\nWe’re unlikely to see such a drastic visual improvement for video games\nrunning atHD or SD, however. With this in mind, it might only be worth buying\na RTX 2080 over a GTX 1080 if you’re going to be gaming in Ultra HD – until\nsupport for real-time ray tracing arrives at least.\n\nOf course, without testing the RTX 2080 ourselves, we can’t say that for sure.\nWe suggest waiting to read our full review to get a better idea of the\ndifference in performance.\n\nNote, also, that Nvidia’s test rig features a 7th-gen Core i9 CPU – Intel is\nrumoured to be on the verge of announcing its 9th generation of processors, so\nby the time you’ve put your money down for an RTX 2080, you might want to\nthink about picking up a new processor to go with that.\n\nIn the press, Nvidia says that in a lot of cases ‘the GeForce RTX 2080 is so\npowerful that the CPU is the bottleneck’, and when you’re running that with an\ni9-7900X, this may well be true. With the rumlured i9-9900K, it might be a\ndifferent story.\n\nIf you’re thinking about making the jump to the 9th-gen processor, you’re also\nlikely to need a bigger board. Expect to see a ton of new motherboards hitting\nshelves later in the year.\n\n**Related:**[ **Intel 9th Gen\nCPU**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/intel-9th-gen-cpu-release-date-\nspecs-3501382)\n\n## Nvidia RTX 2080 vs GTX 1080 – Specs\n\n| **RTX 2080** | **GTX 1080**  \n---|---|---  \n**Generation** |  Turing | Pascal  \n**Announcement** |  August 2018 | May 2016  \n**Cuda cores** |  2944 | 2560  \n**Tensor cores** |  384 | 0  \n**Base speed** |  1515 | 1607  \n**Boost speed** |  1710 (1800 Founders) | 1733  \n**RAM** |  8GB GDDR6 | 8GB GDDR5X  \n**Memory speed** |  14Gbps | 10Gbps  \n**Memory bandwidth** |  448 GB/sec | 320 GB/sec  \n**Power draw** |  215W | 180W  \n**Rec. system power** |  650W | 500W  \n  \nAssess the RTX 2080 by the same metrics we might use for the GTX 1080 and it\ndoesn’t appear to be that impressive an upgrade. You get 15% more CUDA cores\nand 40% faster memory speed.\n\nHowever, Nvidia claims a performance improvement of ‘up to 6x’. We have to dig\na little deeper to discover what this really means.\n\nCUDA cores have been around since 2006. The RTX range brings new Tensor, RT\nCore and Turing SM components into mainstream cards, and these are what will\nreally boost this generation’s functional power.\n\n## Nvidia RTX 2080 vs GTX 1080 – Features\n\nNvidia’s two highlighted features for Turing cards are ‘AI’ and ‘real-time ray\ntracing’.\n\nRay tracing is the tracking of beams of light. It allows for much more\nrealistic-looking shadows and reflections in particular. In a rendered scene\nwith ray tracing, it isn’t only the objects that are rendered, but the light\nbeing bounced around and off them.\n\nConsider, for example, what a textured metallic surface does to light. Or the\nsubtler effect a glass box has on a light source. You might think of it as\ntransparent, but it will still cast a shadow.\n\nUnreal Engine 4’s team posted one of the clearest demonstrations of real-time\nray tracing in action in a _Star Wars_ -inspired video from March 2018. It’s\nmost useful for accurate rendering of reflections across complicated surfaces,\nin a manner that could make video game graphics look real. Or at least closer\nto the quality of a current CGI-rendered movie or game cut-scene.\n\nRay tracing is extremely power-intensive, and the new RTX hardware uses ‘deep\nlearning’ to cut some of this down. You could also interpret this as cheating\nour way to full ray tracing, getting the same perceived effect with less\npower.\n\nUnreal Engine 4, Frostbite and the 4A Engine, as used in [Metro\nExodus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/metro-exodus-release-date-\ngameplay-news-trailer-story-preorder-2952446), have already been used to\ndemonstrate this tech in action. It seems far more obvious an improvement in\nreflections than shadows.\n\nHowever, because of the somewhat specific nature of these changes, the\ndifference in performance in existing games may not be as significant as you\nmight expect. This may be the reason Nvidia didn’t show any traditional\nbenchmark results to highlight the power of the RTX 2080.\n\nAnother significant issue is that there won’t be any games that support ray\ntracing from launch. This is because we’re still waiting for the Windows 10\nupdate that will see the roll out of [Microsoft’s own DirectX Raytracing\nAPI](https://www.pcworld.com/article/3263746/components-graphics/microsoft-\ndirectx-raytracing-dx12-features-hardware-software.html), which Nvidia’s ray\ntracing tech is built upon.\n\nOnce that arrives, RTX 2080 users will finally be able to see ray tracing in\neffect for games such as Shadow of the Tomb Raider and Battlefield V, although\nthe list of compatible games looks pretty thin so far, as it isn’t an easy\ntask for developers to integrate the tech into their games.\n\nThe GTX 1080 may not offer ray tracing, but it can still play many of today’s\ngames at a 4K resolution, at 60fps – although it doesn’t quite manage this\nwith titles such as GTA V.\n\n## Nvidia RTX 2080 vs GTX 1080 – Design\n\nNvidia has switched up the design of its Founders Edition RTX 2080, perhaps in\nresponse to criticisms of the classic model. Instead of the single fan\n‘blower’ layout of the original GTX 1080, you now get two fans.\n\nThis should make the RTX 2080 much quieter, giving you fewer reasons to wait\nfor third-party models. That said, you may well be able to save some money if\nyou wait.\n\n## Nvidia RTX 2080 vs GTX 1080 – Early verdict\n\nUntil we test the RTX 2080, we can’t call a clear winner. But if even a\nfraction of Nvidia’s performance claims ring true then it should be an\nexcellent card that will play pretty much any game with ease. The 1080 remains\nan impressive beast, however. If you just have a 1080p monitor then it’s a\nsolid choice, especially with the discounted price tag.\n\n**Excited by Nvidia’s new card or are you going to go for a discounted 1080\nwhile stocks last?
