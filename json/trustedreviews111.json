They can reach speeds of\nup to 12mph and are expected to make £1 million in revenue by the end of the\nfirst year.\n\nFuture pod commuters will be able to download a special smartphone app to book\nand pay for the pod journeys.\n\nThe 20 trial pods will have steering wheels or joysticks for controls, but\nwill pretty much be able to drive themselves.\n\nThe Government project hopes to cut down traffic, pollution and driver stress\nand one day the technology could be extended to major roads as well.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n“People basically come into MK on the train and they want to go to the city\ncentre, or there is a very large office community around the train station and\nthey may actually want to go to the city centre for a short period and come\nback,” said Jon Beasley, Programme Director from the Transport Systems\nCatapult, one of the project’s collaborators.\n\n“Basically it gives them the option to get to the city centre comfortably,\nsafely, they can continue processing and doing work, reading emails, reading\npapers whilst they go to the city centre itself. So they don’t have to\nconcentrate in the long term how they drive these things.”\n\nHeathrow Airport Terminal 5 already uses a similar type of pod, also designed\nby Ultra Global, but the Milton Keynes’ versions will have GPS, high-\ndefinition cameras and sensors to navigate and avoid pedestrians.\n\n**Next, read our pick of the[best mobile phones of\n2013](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-smartphone_round-up).**  \n**  \nVia:** [Sky News](http://news.sky.com/story/1165018/milton-keynes-pioneers-\ndriverless-car-scheme)\n\n"}
