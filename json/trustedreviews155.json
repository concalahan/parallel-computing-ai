Both [LG](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-tipped-to-battle-snapdragon-with-high-end-mobile-chip) and[Samsung](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-s6-review) areproducing handsets with custom-built chipsets.It’s worth noting that Google has never worked with Huawei on a Nexus devicebefore, so it will be interesting to see what the Chinese OEM can muster up.The last round of Nexus devices – the [Nexus6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/nexus-6-review) and [Nexus9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/nexus-9-review) – were both met with chillyreception, described as underwhelming by many critics.Google will almost certainly make a much greater effort to wow consumers withthe next batch of Nexus wares."}
