It should feature Cortex-A15 cores clocked at 2.2Ghz and a\nbig.LITTLE configuration with four Cortex-A15s and four frugal Cortex-A7s\nclocked at 1.7GHz.\n\nA big.LITTLE configuration would mean the LG Odin chipset will be very power\nefficient and not be a drain on the battery life of future tablets and\nsmartphones.\n\nThe LG Odin was originally tipped to feature in the LG G2 with clock speeds of\n1.7GHz and 1.2GHz respectively for the A15 and A7 cores, but it seems LG has\ndecided to hold back the chipset for future devices.\n\nThe LG G2 has a 2.26Ghz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor, like its\nrivals the [Samsung Galaxy Note 3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-\ngalaxy-note-3_Mobile-Phone_review) and [Google Nexus\n5](https://www.trustedreviews.com/google-nexus-5_Mobile-Phone_review).\n\nAlthough the octa-core Odin is reserved for future smartphones and tablets,\nthe quad-core version should appear in LG Electronics devices like Smart TVs.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nSamsung has already equipped one version of the Samsung Galaxy S4 with its\nocta-core Exynos 5 processor, and other manufacturers will no doubt follow in\n2014.\n\nIf LG does use its LG Odin chipset in future smartphones it would mark a move\naway from a reliance on third-party manufacturers.\n\nLG could save money and make more profit by manufacturing its own chips and it\ncertainly has the facilities to do so.\n\nIt will have to be pretty powerful to compete with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 800\nand the Exynos equivalent, so we’ll be intrigued to see what the LG Odin can\ndo next year.  \n **  \nRead more:[Best smartphones of 2013](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-\nsmartphone_round-up).**  \n **  \nVia:** [P honeArena](http://www.phonearena.com/news/LG-Odin-2.2-GHz-octa-core-\nmobile-processor-prepped-for-G2-and-G-Pad-successors_id49594)\n\n"}
