Here’s are some of the best ones you can buy in 2018\nto get started with Kodi today.**\n\nPopular streaming platform Kodi might have some unsavoury connotations, but\nthe fact is it’s a perfectly legal piece of software designed to help cord\ncutters build the ultimate streaming system.\n\nLooking to get started with all things Kodi? All you need is a decent Android\nTV box, and while there are loads and loads of options out there, we’d\nrecommend going with a name brand, as there are safety issues surrounding a\nnumber the cheap and cheerful devices you’ll see advertised on the internet.\n\nLet’s get started with the best of the best.\n\nThe NVIDIA Shield TV is the most powerful Android TV device around. Despite\nits slender design, this 4K box packs some serious welly, coming not only with\nHDR support but a Tegra X1 graphics card and 3GB of RAM, so it’s also amazing\nfor gaming.\n\nIt’s also the easiest device to install Kodi on, making it a great option for\nmost people, though its £190 RRP means it’s not for everyone.\n\n  * **Buy Now:**[ **Nvidia Shield TV from Amazon UK**](http://amzn.to/2z6nvQT)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThose after a much cheaper but still incredibly capable Kodi streamer should\nlook no further than Amazon’s incredibly versatile Fire TV Stick and big\nsibling the Fire TV 4K. It’s pretty straightforward getting a [Kodi on Fire\nTV](https://www.trustedreviews.com/how-to/install-kodi-fire-tv-stick-2949936)\ndevices, and the dongle and box both support most popular streaming services,\nincluding Prime Video, Netflix, iPlayer, YouTube and Spotify.\n\nBetter still, Amazon is cutting the price of both these devices **from 9am GMT\non Wednesday, February 7.**\n\n  * **Get Deal:[Amazon Fire TV 4K Ultra HD for just £59.99 – save £10](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B06XTWLSRF/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=sl1&tag=tr_dailydeals-21&linkId=d5a48b37f80993d5918d01f7d3d97010)**\n\nAlternatively, save some space (and even more money!) and still enjoy a great\nKodi (and all round streaming experience) with the marvellous Fire TV Stick.\n\n  * **Get Deal:[Amazon Fire TV 4K Ultra HD for just £59.99 – save £10](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B06XTWLSRF/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=sl1&tag=tr_dailydeals-21&linkId=d5a48b37f80993d5918d01f7d3d97010)**\n\nThese are currently the three best Kodi-friendly Android TV devices on the\nmarket – again, we wouldn’t recommend no-name Android TV boxes, due to safety\nconcerns.\n\nThere are plenty of other ways you can equip yourself with Kodi, from new-gen\nconsoles like the [Xbox One X](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/xbox-\none-x) and [Xbox One S](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/xbox-one-s), to\nRaspberry Pi and Linux-based, but Android TV devices offer the ideal\ncombination of usability and affordability, in our opinion.\n\nThe newly announced [Asus Chromebox\n3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/asus-chromebox-3-looks-like-mac-mini-\nupgrade-apple-refuses-make-3368075) also holds some promise further down the\nroad, but we’ll need to wait for it be released so we can test it out for\nourselves before recommending it.\n\n**What’s your favourite ‘Kodi box’ or Android TV device?
