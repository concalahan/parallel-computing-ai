While we can’t make any\npromises today, we are actively working towards a solution that would allow\nepisodes 3 and 4 to be completed and released in some form.”\n\nThe internet seems to be divided on whether this would mean an outsourced team\ncame in – which seems cruel to the people Telltale just laid off, or whether\nthis would take the form of a cash injection and involve them rehiring some of\ntheir staff which also seems cruel to the people Telltale Games just laid off.\n\nIt’s a messy situation that’s just gotten messier. We talk about it on the\nPatch Notes podcast, embedded below.\n\n**UPDATE: In a statement, Telltale Games has confirmed Friday’s lay-offs are\npart of a ‘majority studio closure’ due to ‘insurmountable challenges’. The\nfirm says the remaining staff are staying on to fulfil existing obligations,\nbut after that it’s curtains.**\n\n“Today Telltale Games made the difficult decision to begin a majority studio\nclosure following a year marked by insurmountable challenges,” the company\nsaid. “A majority of the company’s employees were dismissed earlier this\nmorning.” The remaining employees will stay on “to fulfill the company’s\nobligations to its board and partners.” Multiple sources have suggested that\nemployees are leaving the company without severence packages, while others say\nthat a small team of 25 are being kept on to handle things for Telltale’s\nMinecraft Story Mode project for Netflix. At this stage, all games in\ndevelopment at Telltale are being cancelled, with [The Walking Dead: The Final\nSeason](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/walking-dead-final-season-\nepisode-1) wrapping up after the soon to be released Episode 2. This also puts\npaid to the fortcoming Stranger Things game, and the anticipated The Wolf\nAmong Us season 2.\n\nThe firm plans to comment on the status of its product portfolio in the weeks\nto come.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n> [pic.twitter.com/evqg5X98WZ](https://t.co/evqg5X98WZ)\n\n>\n\n> — Telltale Games (@telltalegames) [September 21,\n2018](https://twitter.com/telltalegames/status/1043252010999410689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n_Original story continues below…_\n\n**Telltale Games, the studio behind episodic titles like The Walking Dead,\nMinecraft: Story Mode and Game of Thrones, has laid off a large number of\nemployees.**\n\nAmid some reports claiming the studio would be [shutting\ndown](https://www.usgamer.net/articles/report-telltale-games-shutting-down-\nthe-wolf-among-us-2-and-stranger-things-canceled) completely, [The\nVerge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/21/17888162/telltale-games-layoffs-the-\nwalking-dead) says around 25 team members of the 250 will remain on staff. The\nstudio itself is yet to comment on the reports, but employees have taken to\nTwitter to confirm they’ve been made redundant.\n\nMatt Kim, news editor for [USgamer](https://www.usgamer.net/articles/report-\ntelltale-games-shutting-down-the-wolf-among-us-2-and-stranger-things-\ncanceled), says the skeleton staff will stay on to complete the final season\nof The Walking Dead, the [first episode of which arrived last\nmonth](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/walking-dead-final-season-\nepisode-1). However, he says, the sequel to The Wolf Among Us and the planned\nStranger Things game could be dead in the water as a result of the layoffs.\n\n> I'm told that Telltale is keeping a skeleton crew to finish The Walking Dead\nFinal Season but The Wolf Among Us 2 and Stranger Things are effectively\ncancelled. Developing.<https://t.co/dgEGaUwyhE>\n\n>\n\n> — Matt Kim (@LawofTD) [September 21,\n2018](https://twitter.com/LawofTD/status/1043223826941669376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nToday’s news comes following a prolonged period of turmoil at the studio\nresponsible for some of the most popular titles of recent times.\n\n**Related:[The Walking Dead – The Final\nSeason](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/telltales-walking-dead-final-\nseason-everything-know-3236995)**\n\nLast November, the company also laid-off a quarter of its staff. At the time,\nCEO Pete Hawley said: “The realities of the environment we face moving forward\ndemand we evolve, as well, reorienting our organization with a focus on\ndelivering fewer, better games with a smaller team.”\n\nEarlier this year, a report cited [an environment of “toxic\nmanagement”](https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/20/17130056/telltale-games-\ndeveloper-layoffs-toxic-video-game-industry) at the studio, where staff were\nconstantly overworked. This summer, the co-founder and former CEO of Telltale,\nKevin Bruner sued the company, seeking damages.\n\nThe studio has also produced games based on high-profile franchises like\nGuardians of the Galaxy, Batman and Back to the Future, as well the Tales From\nThe Borderlands series. If today’s reports are confirmed, it’ll come as a\ndevastating blow to the developer community as well as the legions of fan\nwho’ve dined out on Telltale’s episodic storytelling.\n\nWe’ve reached out to Telltale Games for comment on this development and will\nupdate this article if a response is forthcoming.\n\n**This is a developing story…**\n\n"}
