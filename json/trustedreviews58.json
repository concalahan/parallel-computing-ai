The experience offered upby the iPhone X showcases some notable changes on the interaction front thataren’t necessarily for the better (compared to more traditionally-shapediPhones). However, it also offers a consistently great app experience and,paired with the powerful internals, still feels fast and fluid after months ofuse.Sadly, the Note 9 doesn’t launch on the freshly named [Android 9.0Pie](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/android-pie). Instead, it arriveson the slightly older Android 8.1 Oreo, with its own Samsung Experience UI ontop. It offers a more coherent navigation structure to that of iOS on theiPhone X and has the added benefit of all that S Pen stylus functionality.**Related:[Samsung Galaxy Note 9 vs Galaxy Note8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-9-vs-note-8-3526974)**Whip out the S Pen and its new Bluetooth connectivity lets you remotelycontrol presentations while your Note is hooked up to the big screen using thedesktop-like DeX environment 9which no longer requires any form of dock). Youcan remotely pause and play media with it, too. Air Command also means the SPen can be used to grab snippets on-screen, doodle Live Messages (which mirrorApple’s Digital Touch feature), and translate text to or from other languagesin real-time.## Samsung Galaxy Note 9 vs iPhone X price – Which is better value?The iPhone X launched with a headline-grabbing £999 price tag in the UK, andthat’s for the smaller capacity 64GB model. Samsung’s new Note is equallypremium but only break that same threshold in its higher-capacity form, withthe 128GB costing £899 and the 512GB version costing £1099.## Early VerdictAt first glance, it would seem that the Note 9 offers more bang for your buck,matching the iPhone on most fronts and offering additional benefits such asfaster wireless charging, DeX support and the S Pen stylus. However, for somethe superior app experience, performance and compact power of the iPhone Xstill make for a more compelling purchase."}
