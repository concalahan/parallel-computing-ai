But Sony may just have provided us with an answer in\nthe shape of its upcoming ZF9 series.**\n\nSony ZF9 vs Samsung Q9FN: Recently unveiled in New York, the Sony ZF9 is the\neagerly awaited successor to Sony’s much-loved ZD9. They use the same key\ntechnology of a direct backlighting system with hundreds of zones of local\ndimming. Aside from that – as we’ve already discussed in our separate [Sony\nZF9 vs ZD9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/sony-zf9-vs-sony-zd9-whats-\ndifference-3523377) comparison – the Sony ZF9 is a very different animal, in\nways that make it an even more intriguing rival for the [Samsung\nQ9FN](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-q9fn-qled).\n\n![Sony ZF9 vs Samsung\nQ9FN](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSony ZF9\n\n## Sony ZF9 vs Samsung Q9FN – Design and dimming zones\n\nIn terms of design, both the Sony ZF9 and Samsung Q9FN look chunkier round the\nback than most modern TVs because of their need to accommodate direct (rather\nthan edge) LED lighting systems. They both have trim screen frames – but\nSamsung’s Q9FN just wins on design thanks to its attractive, centrally mounted\nstand (in the UK format) versus the ZF9’s oversized and slightly comical feet.\n\nNeither Sony or Samsung like to divulge stuff like the number of dimming zones\nthey’re using, but we know it’s more than 400 in Samsung’s case, and should be\naround 600 in the ZF9’s case if it follows the old Sony ZD9. My impression\nfrom Sony’s launch event is that the Sony ZF9 may actually use fewer dimming\nzones than the ZD9 series. But we can only guess for the time being.\n\nIn any case, the sheer number of dimming zones a TV has is not a guarantee of\npicture quality. Also important here are the processing system and the\nalgorithms that drive that local dimming system.\n\n**Related:[Best TVs](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-tv-3440232)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n![Sony ZF9 vs Samsung\nQ9FN](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSamsung Q9FN\n\n## Sony ZF9 Vs Samsung Q9FN – Processing\n\nSamsung has made big steps in this respect with its new Q Engine, which can\ngradually dim the light in each individual dimming zone as the light travels\naway from the zone’s brightest point.\n\nThe Sony ZF9 is the first TV to carry the X1 Ultimate processing chip. This is\naround twice as powerful as the old X1 Extreme processor in Sony’s ZD9 set.\nOne of Sony’s top TV engineers confirmed at the ZF9 launch event that one job\nof the Ultimate processor is to drive a much-improved local dimming system.\n\nThe X1 Ultimate processor’s extra power should also make some traditional Sony\nstrengths even better. Particularly the upscaling of HD sources to 4K, and\nupconversion of standard dynamic range pictures to HDR. Samsung’s own Q Engine\nis no slouch in these respects either, but from what we’ve seen so far, the\nSony Z9F will likely break new ground when it comes to bringing legacy content\nup to the latest standards.\n\n![Sony ZF9 vs Samsung\nQ9FN](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSony ZF9\n\n## Sony ZF9 vs Samsung Q9FN – Brightness\n\nSony never discusses its TVs’ brightness specifications, so we don’t know yet\nif the Sony ZF9 will be as bright as the ZD9 (which measured around 1600 nits)\nor the Samsung Q9FN (2413 nits). From what we could see of the Sony ZF9, my\nsuspicion is that it may be slightly less bright than its predecessor. And so\nmuch less bright than the Samsung Q9FN.\n\nThis is perhaps unsurprising, given that the Q9FN uses Samsung’s proprietary\nQLED technology, where colour is provided by Quantum Dots clad in metal so\nthat they can be pushed harder for more HDR-friendly brightness and colour\n‘volume’.\n\nIn the face of such aggression from Samsung and HDR’s hunger for light, Sony’s\npotential (I must stress that it isn’t yet confirmed) step back from the\npursuit of brightness with the ZF9 may sound counter-intuitive. However,\nthere’s enticing method to Sony’s apparent madness.\n\nNamely that it has designed the ZF9 with a new mission in mind: delivering\npictures that get as close as possible to the way their creators intended them\nto look like. And since many creators currently design their content on Sony’s\nBVM-X300 OLED professional monitor, the ZF9’s pictures appear to have been\ntuned to bring them closer to that.\n\nThis puts them squarely at odds with those of the Samsung Q9FN, which\naggressively uses its brightness to make the most of the brightest end of\nHDR’s potential light spectrum.\n\n**Related:[Best soundbars](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\ntv-3440232)**\n\n![Sony ZF9 vs Samsung\nQ9FN](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSamsung Q9FN\n\n## Sony ZF9 vs Samsung Q9FN – Performance\n\nFirst impressions of the ZF9’s performance suggest that it may also sacrifice\na little black level response compared with the Q9FN in its quest to get close\nto the X300 monitor. Again, this might sound counter-intuitive, given that\nOLED screens are renowned for their inky black colours.\n\nHowever, the ZF9’s approach let it reproduce impressive amounts of subtle\ndetailing in the darkest parts of the ZF9 picture during the launch event\ndemos, whereas Samsung’s focus on combining very bright peaks with very deep\nblacks can lead to subtle details in the darkest picture areas getting\n‘crushed’ out of the picture.\n\nUntil we get a ZF9 in to test fully, it’s impossible to say which approach\ngives the best overall results. It could simply be a case of different strokes\nfor different folks.\n\nBut there is one performance area where the ZF9 definitely outguns the Q9FN:\nviewing angles. A proprietary new panel design lets you watch the ZF9 from\nalmost right angles without the usual contrast and colour reductions.\n\n![Sony ZF9 vs Samsung\nQ9FN](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSony ZF9\n\nAlso likely to give the ZF9 an edge is Sony’s X-Motion Clarity system. This\nuses the TV’s direct lighting and local dimming to improve how motion looks by\nmanipulating the back light only in those areas of the picture where the\nmotion is taking place. This avoids the image-wide brightness loss associated\nwith the black frame insertion system usually needed to get such natural\nmotion from LCD TVs.\n\nSamsung’s Q9FN, however, has a clever trick of its own. Filters in its screen\nsoak up ambient light and room reflections supremely well, making pictures\neasier to enjoy even in a bright room. The ZF9 screens certainly looked more\nreflective during the recent ‘reveal’ demonstrations.\n\nThe Q9FN would have been able to boast professional calibration tools over any\nprevious Sony rival. But with the ZF9, Sony has introduced calibration support\nfor the first time – including an app for running an auto-calibration process\nif you have the necessary measuring equipment.\n\nSony’s new ‘as the director intended’ focus has also seen it become the first\nTV brand to introduce a Netflix Calibrated Mode. This adjusts the TV’s picture\nsettings when watching the Netflix app, to make it look like what the\nNetflix’s mastering team intended. No such mode is available on Samsung’s\nQ9FN.\n\n![Sony ZF9 vs Samsung\nQ9FN](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSamsung Q9FN\n\n## Sony ZF9 vs Samsung Q9FN – HDR formats\n\nThe Samsung and Sony sets differ, too, on the HDR formats they support. Both\nhandle the industry-standard HDR10 and broadcast-friendly HLG systems. But\nwhile the ZF9 supports the Dolby Vision ‘premium’ HDR format with its extra\nlayer of scene-by-scene data, the Q9FNs support HDR10+. This is a new rival to\nDolby Vision, developed predominantly by Samsung.\n\nThere isn’t enough HDR10+ content out there yet to form a conclusion as to\nwhich format delivers the best results. And the fact that there are already\ndozens of Dolby Vision streams and 4K Blu-rays available to watch at home\nmeans Sony’s HDR horse is off to a flyer. But the first HDR10+ 4K Blu-rays\nfrom 20th Century Fox are incoming soon, and all of Amazon’s HDR TV shows are\nalready streaming in HDR10+.\n\nThe final comparison to make between the ZF9 and Q9FN is their smart systems.\nDuring its demonstration of the upcoming ZF9, Sony gave us a tantalising\nglimpse of the new Android Oreo system. This looked far superior to past\nAndroid TV interfaces: less cluttered, more intuitive and with a greater\nunderstanding of the stuff TV owners want their smart systems to be focused\non.\n\nThe Samsung Q9FN uses Samsung’s own Eden smart platform. And a very good\nsystem this is too: well organised, slick, easy to customise and rich in\ncontent. I suspect it may still have the edge over the Oreo version of Android\n– but at least I look forward to trying out Oreo much more than I did spending\ntime with any previous Android TV system.\n\nWe’ll be bringing you a review of a Sony ZF9 as soon as the TV launches in\nautumn 2018.
