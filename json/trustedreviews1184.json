In the past this has included substantial\nperformance improvements and app management. The new watchOS 4 update looks to\ncontinue this trend. Here are some of the most important features.\n\n## watchOS 4 – Siri Watch face\n\nApple is using Siri to proactively bring information to a new Apple Watch\nface. This face, powered by Siri Intelligence, will update contemporaneously\nwith new information depending on the user’s needs and habits.\n\nIt’s powered by machine learning and, in essence, is just like the Google Now\napp on Android.\n\n![Siri_Watch_Face](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThe watch face will refresh whenever users raise their wrist throughout the\nday and enable users to flip through cards serving up different pieces of\ninformation.\n\n**Related:**[ **Apple Watch 2 review**  \n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/apple-watch-2-review)  \nThere is Photos, content from Apple news, coaching reminders from the Activity\nApp, the weather, a reminder from the Breathe app. It’ll tell you what time\nthe sunset is and give you options to control HomeKit enabled products, in\nline with that time of day.\n\n## watchOS 4 – Person to person Apple Pay payments\n\nWith watchOS 4, you’ll be able to make and receive payments between family and\nfriends by using iMessage or Siri. Money you receive will be held in an Apple\nPay Cash account, ready for you to spend anywhere Apple Pay is accepted or to\nsend on to other friends when they call in your debt.\n\n## watchOS 4 – Activity app\n\nThe Activity app is also getting an overhaul with watchOS 4. Apple is\nintroducing monthly goals and will deliver notifications to users that are\napproaching new streaks, in the hope of boosting motivation. Apple says these\ngoals will be achievable because they’re based on the user’s actual workout\nhistory.\n\nApple has also expanded the swim mode, to automatically detect different sets.\nFor Crossfitters or triathletes there’s also the ability to easily add a\ndifferent workout to the same session for those involved in multiple\nactivities.\n\n![watchOS\n4](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nBig news for more hardened fitness fanatics is the addition of High Intensity\nInterval Training (HIIT). These are workouts built around periods of intense\nactivity followed by recovery periods and are seen as a more effective workout\nover a shorter period of time compared to steady-state exercise, such as\njogging.\n\n**Related:[What is HIIT?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/hiit-\nworkouts-2951271)**\n\nHeart rate monitoring of HIIT workouts have typically been an area where\nwearables have struggled but we found the Apple Watch Series 2’s heart rate\nsensor proved surprisingly capable. When conducting an Outdoor Run or more\nintense Outdoor Walk activity, the Apple Watch will also be able to estimate\nyour VO2 Max, which is a function of many fitness trackers and running watches\nand is a great way to measure your overall cardiovascular fitness.\n\n**Related:[What is VO2 Max?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/what-is-\nvo2-max-2954082)**\n\nApple is also teaming with a number of fitness equipment providers like\nTurboGym, which makes it possible to directly sync workout data back to the\nApple Watch. This will work through NFC.\n\n![watch\nequipment](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nOther useful fitness functions include the new ability to use the display as a\nsafety feature to make you more visible when night running.\n\nSome keen detectives at [iHelp BR](https://ihelpbr.com/arquivos-internos-do-\nios-11-revelam-novos-tipos-de-exercicios-para-o-apple-watch/) also poked\naround under the hood of watchOS 4’s beta and found some rather intriguing\nicons nestled away in the Workouts app. If the icons are to be believed, Apple\nis seriously bolstering the activities that the Apple Watch 2 can track and\nmonitor.\n\n**Related:[How the Apple Watch 2 stacks up against dedicated fitness\ntrackers](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/this-is-how-the-apple-\nwatch-2-stacks-up-against-dedicated-fitness-trackers)**\n\nThe full list of icons include: badminton, barre, baseball, step training,\nsurfing, sailing, skating, snow sports, pilates, paddle sports, kickboxing,\njump rope, lacrosse, stretching, functional strength training, golf, fishing,\nfencing, equestrian sports, downhill skiing, dance, curling, cross training,\ncricket, cross-country skiing, core training, bowling, boxing, and climbing.\n\nHere’s hoping this is more official support than what is already covered by\nthe existing ‘Other workout’ option. We expect to hear more about these on\nSeptember 12th.\n\n## watchOS 4 – Heart Rate app\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nA new Heart Rate app will give you live data from the Apple Watch’s heart rate\nsensor including resting heart and recovery heart rate, which will give you a\nindication of your cardiovascular health. The Apple Watch will also detect if\nyour heart rate is abnormally high when you’re not actually exercising. This\ncould potentially be an early indicator of health conditions such as an\noncoming stroke. The Apple Watch will also be detecting heart rate rhythm. All\nof the heart rate data will plug into a major Apple Heart Study with Stanford\nMedicine, which could improve understanding of heart conditions.\n\n## watchOS 4 – Music\n\nIn watchOS 4, the Music experience is getting a redesign and revamp. “Apple\nWatch paired with AirPods has really become a magical combination,” Apple\nsays. We’re not so sure about this, but go on…\n\nApple says it is automatically syncing content from the Apple Watch it thinks\nyou’ll want to listen to, so your mixes and playlists and new albums will all\nbe available on the Watch without you having to mess around with transfers.\n\n![watchOS 4\nMusic](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nUsers will also be able to pick out a playlist to start in sync with their\nworkouts, or alter the playlist from the workout app with a simple swipe.\n\nThere’s also new full-face album art designs arranged in a deck of cards that\nare easier to swipe through.\n\n## watchOS 4 – More new watch faces\n\nApple is continuing its partnership with Disney. Following on from the\noriginal Apple Watch’s Mickey Mouse face, watchOS 4 will introduce Buzz, Woody\nand Jessie from Pixar’s Toy Story franchise. Yes. Elsewhere there’s also a new\nkaleidoscope watch face that can be adjusted using the digital crown.\n\n![Toy\nStore](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Related:[Apple Watch 3 vs Apple Watch\n2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-watch-3-vs-apple-\nwatch-2-3286324)**\n\n## watchOS 4 – The rest…\n\nApple has also added a Flashlight App in the new watchOS 4 operating system.\nThere’s also support for audio recording in the background navigation, screen\nauto-rotate and native Core Bluetooth. The latter is a big deal for the future\nas that means greater support for external sensors and devices, such as oft\nrumoured glucose sensors.\n\n**Will Apple watchOS 4 tempt you into an Apple Watch purchase this year?
