It may not be as groundbreaking as it once\nwas but it still stands as a great entry-point into the iOS ecosystem and all\nthat the App Store has to offer. What’s more, the various iPhone iterations\nthat have appeared since the iPhone 8 have only helped to drive its price\ndown, meaning there’s truly never been a better time to buy.\n\nIf you’re still sceptical then just remember that Apple is still currently\nselling the iPhone 8 brand new, even after the announcement of the iPhone XS,\niPhone XS Max and iPhone XR. This means that the device will be supported into\nthe foreseeable future with plenty of updates and content.\n\n**Related:**[iPhone XS vs iPhone XS\nMax](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-xs-release-date-specs-price-\nuk-3551351)\n\nFor that reason, the iPhone 8 is also a great shout for parents looking to get\ntheir kids an inexpensive iPhone with a low data contract. Of course, if\nyou’re after a high data contract for all that late-night Fortnite fun then\nthere are plenty of those too. One great contract will nab you 45GB of data\nfor just £41.96 each month and no upfront cost on EE.\n\n### The top iPhone 8 deals right now\n\n[](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3202&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-\nnewmobiledeals-\niphone8&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fcontract%2Fiphone-8-64gb-space-\ngrey%2Fee-essential-plan-15gb-43-24mths-24)\n\n[](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3202&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-\nnewmobiledeals-\niphone8&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fcontract%2Fiphone-8-64gb-space-\ngrey%2Fee-essential-plan-15gb-43-24mths-24)\n\n###\n\n[iPhone 8 64GB Space Grey – 45GB of data on EE\n\n](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3202&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-\nnewmobiledeals-\niphone8&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fcontract%2Fiphone-8-64gb-space-\ngrey%2Fee-essential-plan-15gb-43-24mths-24)\n\nMore data than you can shake a stick at combined with absolutely nothing to\npay up front.

It shares some features with its pricier cousin, including\nthe latest A11 Bionic chip that makes it feel slick and responsive. It also\nintroduces fast wireless charging for the first time, letting you top up the\nbattery just by placing it on a wireless charging pad.\n\nOtherwise, you can expect the usual fantastic camera capabilities that have\nbecome associated with iPhones. This is thanks to a 12-megapixel f/1.8 camera\nwith OIS. The 4.7-inch HD True Tone display can change its temperature to\nmatch your environment, making it look better and be less damaging to your\neyes. The iPhone 8 currently runs the latest version of iOS 11, which has all\nthe apps and games you could want.\n\n* * *\n\n### iPhone 8 not the phone for you?\n\n**Consider these:**\n\n  * **Related:** [Best iPhone XS Max deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-iphone-xs-max-deals-3565655)\n  * **Related:** [Best iPhone XS deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-iphone-xs-deals-3565210)\n  * **Related:**[Best iPhone 7 deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-iphone-7-deals-2993225)\n  * **Related:** [Best iPhone 8 Plus deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-iphone-8-plus-deals-3289474)\n  * **Related:** [Best iPhone X deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-iphone-x-deals-3289493)\n  * **Related:** [Best Samsung Galaxy S9 deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s9-deals-3402357)\n  * **Related:** [Best Samsung Galaxy S8 deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-samsung-galaxy-s8-deals-2993182)\n  * **Related:**[Best SIM only deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-sim-only-deals-2943877)\n\n* * *\n\n## How to pick the right iPhone 8 deal for you\n\n![iPhone\n8](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\n### Consider what you’re willing to pay upfront\n\nA good general rule of thumb is that the more you’re willing to spend upfront,\nthe lower your monthly cost will be. Typically, spending more upfront will\nalso reduce the amount you pay over the course of your contract, which is\ntypically 24 months.\n\nThis is called your total cost of ownership (TCO), which is your monthly cost\nx the term of your contract + any upfront cost.\n\nIf you don’t have the money to splash out at the beginning, look for a\ncontract with a low upfront cost, some contracts will even completely forego\nany upfront cost, which is handy.\n\n### Work out how much data you need\n\nWe’ve talked a lot already about how important data is nowadays. Most of use\ndon’t really care about the number of texts and call minutes you’re given for\na contract. Most will give you more than you’ll ever use in a month, if not\njust giving you an unlimited allowance.\n\nNowadays, it’s all about data. Data is what you need to browse the internet on\nyour phone, check your emails, stream Netflix or Spotify, or send messages on\nservices like WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger. The likes of WhatsApp and\nFaceTime let you make calls and video calls that use your data allowance, too,\nmaking call minutes even more redundant.\n\nStreaming video is going to be the biggest data gobbler, so if you plan on\nusing Netflix on the move a lot, make sure you go for a big data package.\nHaving said that, some networks such as Three don’t count Netflix and other\nservices against your allowance, letting you go nuts. Just make sure to read\nthe terms of your contract before going too overboard.\n\nIt’s also worth comparing the TCO of higher data tariffs against the lower\noptions. Sometimes you can get more data for the same amount of money, and\nthere’s really no reason not to have more data as it’ll give you some\nbreathing room if you suddenly do become a massive Netflix binger.\n\n### How to choose the right mobile network\n\n### **![iPhone 8\nback](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)**\n\nUnless you’re determined to stick with your current mobile network, you’ve got\nthe extra job of picking a new provider when you upgrade. It could be that one\nknockout deal makes the decision easy, but if you’re stuck, it doesn’t hurt to\nget clued up on what the main providers are offering with their phone\ncontracts.\n\nExtra perks and freebies can really help separate one provider from the next.\nSome contracts will bundle in subscription services for free, like Now TV or\nApple Music, so if you’re interested in these already, these can compound the\nsavings. A service like Spotify normally costs £9.99 a month, so over a\ntypical 24 month contract that’s a saving of £240. Not to be sniffed at if you\nwant streaming music from your shiny new iPhone 8.\n\n### Three\n\nLots of people choose Three because the network gives you a heck of a lot more\n4G data for your money than others, but there’s an extra bonus in store if you\nlike your data in supersized servings. Three’s Go Binge service gives you\nunlimited 4G streaming time on apps like Netflix, Apple Music, Soundcloud and\nloads more without eating into your data allowance.\n\n### Vodafone\n\nVodafone is generously offering a free subscription to services such as NOW\nTV, Spotify Premium or Sky Sports Mobile TV when you buy one if its Red\nEntertainment packages. That could be a major deciding factor if you’ve been\nagonising over whether to pick up one of those subscriptions for a while.\n\nIf you’re a frequent flyer, the recent expansion of Vodafone’s roaming plans\nmight be of interest. Red Entertainment packages can now be used abroad with\nno additional cost in 77 countries, including the US, which is great news if\nyou want to avoid nasty surprise bills when you get back from your time\nabroad.\n\n### O2\n\nO2 isn’t known for the being the cheapest network when it comes to contracts\non major flagship phones, but it has a couple of great features that make it a\nsolid, reliable choice.\n\nWith an O2 Refresh contract, your monthly bill gets split into two payments:\nthe cost of the phone, and your service plan. Once you’ve paid off the cost of\nyour phone, your bill reduces. You can also choose to trade in your phone to\nupgrade at any time.\n\nO2 also offers flexible contracts that let you change your airtime tariff up\nor down once a month, which could come in handy if your mobile habits aren’t\nconsistent.\n\n### EE\n\nEE claims to have the biggest 4G coverage in the UK – a major boon if you hate\ngetting caught in a dead spot when you need to do some urgent Googling. The\npopular network also offers a free six-month Apple Music subscription, as well\nas a three-month sign-up with BT Sports on mobile.\n\n### iD\n\nCarphone Warehouse’s network, iD, is a brilliant option if you’re on a budget,\nbut it’s also got a fantastic Data Rollover feature that might just swing it\nfor certain buyers. At the end of the month, if you haven’t used all of your\ndata allowance, iD kindly rolls it over into your next month.\n\n### Make sure you check mobile coverage\n\nFinally, the one thing you should definitely do before you commit to a network\nis check to make sure the coverage is good in your area.

The\niPhone 8 supports something called Wi-Fi Calling, which is also supported by\nall of the UK’s big network operators. This essentially lets you use a Wi-Fi\ninternet connection to make and receive calls and texts, bypassing the need to\nhave reception from a traditional cell tower.\n\nThe calls and texts still come out of your regular allowance as normal, but\nyou should find you have much better call quality over Wi-Fi. To turn this on,\non your iPhone 8 just go to Settings > Phone > Wi-Fi Calling and toggle this\nsetting on. This is great if there are certain places where you never get\nreception, such as in basements.\n\n### Move providers but keep your phone number\n\nIf you’re moving network providers, say from O2 to EE, you can bring your old\nphone number with you. No need to message everyone in your phone book with\nyour new digits. To do this, simply contact your old provider either by phone\nor online and ask for something called a PAC code.\n\nYou then take this PAC code and give it to your new provider. This gives them\npermission to port over your old phone number, which often takes about one\nbusiness day so be sure to keep your old SIM in the interim if you don’t want\nto go off the grid. After it’s all done, you’ll have the phone number it’s\ntaken you years to memorise available to use with your shiny new phone and\nprovider.
