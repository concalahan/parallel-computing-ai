Rather than having the Apple Watchon your wrist, it actually moves it to the back of your hand, just below yourthumb. It’s unorthodox but it makes for a much more natural way to quicklyview the display without having to rotate your wrist.All models of the Apple Watch 3 remain water-resistant to 50m and will happilysurvive a dunk in salt water, too. The new model uses the same charming water-ejection method as the Series 2, where it will play a specific tone to ejectwater from the speaker.[ Next  Display, Speaker and LTE Performance](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/apple-watch-3-display-lte-performance)"}
