But that’s exactly the big new\nchange to come in Madden NFL 19 and, despite its questionable name, it really\nhas changed almost every aspect of the experience.\n\nThe fancy real player motion tag is really just a good way of grouping a lot\nof subtle changes together, but when you start to break it down it becomes\nclear just how impactful these changes are, and how they create the most\nrealistic and satisfying Madden yet. After switching to the Frostbite engine\nlast year, the team has reformed the physical side of things, which has\nresulted in better control over the run game, top players having signature\nstyles and actions, and of course some much bigger hits.\n\nWith new rules coming in to better protect players in the real NFL, it seems a\nlittle strange that the Madden team would make big hits feel as good as they\ndo, but smashing into a running back who tried to make a big cut with a full-\nspeed linebacker is insanely satisfying. With tons of new animation options\nfor tackles you never really feel like you were unfairly brought to the\nground.\n\n**Related:[Best PS4\nGames](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/ps4-games-3431751)**\n\n![madden nfl\n19](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nEven after the play is dead the new focus on moments has brought some big\nchanges, with players now returning to their feet in more realistic ways. No\nlonger will they seem to levitate up, or try to climb over six other people to\nreturn to the huddle. It’s still not quite perfect, with a few instances of\nplayers trying to hug each other as they stand up, but it sure makes things\nlook a lot better than previous years.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Google Home Hub YouTube](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Will Google Home Hub ever get Netflix?

A whole host of new movement options have been\nadded, most of which come from the ability to slow down your full speed sprint\nby letting go of the R2 button. Flick the right stick in a direction at the\nsame time and you will make a sharp cut and hopefully watch the defender fly\npast you. Then if you manage to time it right you can hit the R2 button again\nto accelerate out of the cut with speed and with a bit of luck have a clear\nrun to the end zone.\n\nThis is just one of a heap of changes for runners, with other additions such\nas hitting the hole with the right stick allowing you to burst through a tight\ngap in the line, or being able to push your linemen to create a gap for you to\nhit, making the run game feel better than ever. Sure, everyone still wants to\nhit that awesome 75-yard post route for a touchdown, but now breaking through\nthe line and juking a couple of defenders is just as satisfying and equally as\nlikely to happen.\n\nIt may be a marketing buzzword but the real player motion system changes\nenough on the field that it feels new, and easily the most enjoyable on-field\nexperience in a long time, but at the same time, it still feels like the\nMadden we have become accustomed to in the last few years. Subtle additions\nsuch as signature movements and behaviours for the big stars, which will see\nAaron Rodgers constantly adjusting his thigh pad, for example, only add to the\nrealism.\n\n**Related:[Best Xbox One Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-xbox-\none-games-3435271)**\n\n![madden nfl\n19](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nOff the field, the changes become a little less noticeable. Along with\nmultiple quality of life improvements and improved visuals, the big new change\nto Franchise mode are schemes having a direct impact on players. Now, offense\nand defense runs will have an impact on how well a player fits into your team,\nand if they don’t fit your style then you will want to use the streamlined\nupgrade system to make them fit your system.\n\nIt’s a small change and one that will disappoint those who like to min-max\ntheir players by only upgrading certain attributes, which is no longer\npossible, but one that makes it easier for newcomers to understand and adds an\nextra thought process when drafting and bringing in free agents.\n\nThere is also the addition of custom draft classes, which allow you to edit\npretty much everything about all players in the draft class. Now chances are\nthat few people will actually create a perfect draft class of up and coming\nstars from the real world, but thanks to a very easy to use sharing system you\ncan grab one of the community made classes and draft the NFL stars of\ntomorrow.\n\nOver in the world of Madden Ultimate Team, the only real addition of note is\nMUT Solo Battles, which allow you to take on the AI in a battle and nab some\nserious rewards if you do well. It’s a nice distraction that probably should\nhave been added a while back, and can offer a decent challenge, but it\nprobably won’t be where you spend most of your time.\n\n**Related:[Best PC Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-pc-\ngames)**\n\n![madden nfl\n19](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe real surprise of Madden 19 is just how good it’s story-driven Longshot\nmode is once again. Last year was great, but this time it’s even better, which\nis quite the achievement. The story picks up quite a while after the close of\nlast year’s offering, but we are still following Devin Wade, who starts out\nbattling for a place on the Cowboys’ roster, and Colt Cruise, whose NFL dreams\nseem to be on their last legs as things start out. Throughout the course of\nthe story multiple twists and turns, along with some genuinely likeable\ncharacters, will keep you glued to your seat, and there’s a good chance you’ll\nplay through it in one sitting.\n\nWithout getting into spoiler territory the high school games are the undoubted\nhighlight, thanks to the totally different setting and brilliant commentators\nwho are significantly more entertaining than the standard commentary team who\nreuse lines constantly. There are a few emotional punches that do have an\nimpact and some twists that are genuine surprises.\n\nA few scenes are a little cliché, the big bad guy really doesn’t seem like a\ncredible threat, and Devin’s story seems to disappear for most of the second\nact, but these are all minor issues in what is a thoroughly enjoyable few\nhours, and easily the best story any sports game has ever produced. It’s just\na shame that you will have to rely on the questionable AI when playing as\nDevin, which can lead to a few frustrating moments.\n\n**VERDICT**\n\nThere’s enough in terms of one field changes to make this feel like a\nsubstantially different game to Madden NFL 18, and all of those changes are\nfor the better, with collisions and running being much improved. There are\nstill occasional physics issues but they are greatly reduced, and playing\nfeels incredibly satisfying most of the time.\n\nOff the field, improvements are severely lacking, with only minor additions to\nFranchise and Ultimate Team, but for most that won’t matter as the core of\nthese modes can keep you entertained well past the Super Bowl. Longshot is\nonce again the star of the show, great big-name cameos and a story you will\ngenuinely care about make this a must play for everyone who picks up Madden\nthis year.\n\nMadden NFL 19 is much more than a roster update, but if you were hoping for\nsweeping changes off the field you will be very disappointed.\n\n## Score\n\n  \n\n"}
