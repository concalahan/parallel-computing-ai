All the Black Friday tips and tricks you need are right\nhere.**\n\nHere are our expert bits of advice to help you nab the hottest bargains this\nBlack Friday. With multiple decades of combined experience shopping and\nfinding the greatest Black Friday discounts, we’re here to help you snare only\nthe best deals and avoid the rest of the noise.\n\n## **1) Black Friday shopping tips – make a wishlist**\n\nIt might sound obvious, but going into Black Friday with an idea of what you\nactually want to buy should be your first step. Otherwise, you might find\nyourself making impulse purchases you don’t really need. So make a list of\nwhat you’re after beforehand, be that in a [Google\nKeep](https://www.google.com/keep/) list or just classic pen and paper.\n\nIf you’re doing a lot of your online shopping via Amazon, then add the\nproducts you want to your basket beforehand. The basket will actually tell you\nif the prices of its contents have changed (either up or down), so you can\ninstantly see if the products you want have been discounted.\n\nThe Amazon Assistant browser extension is also great for compiling a list, as\nit will let you add products to your basket when browsing other retailers – as\nwell as showing you Amazon’s competing price. You can download it\n[here.](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/BIT)\n\nBased on our experience, some of the key product categories to look out for\nthis year are:\n\n  * **[Headphone Black Friday deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/cheap-headphones-black-friday-2993303)**\n  * **[TV Black Friday deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/black-friday-tv-deals-2018-2993362)**\n  * **[Laptop Black Friday deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/laptop-deals-black-friday-3238633)**\n  * **[Nintendo Switch Black Friday deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/nintendo-switch-deals-black-friday-2993180)**\n  * **[PS4 Black Friday deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-ps4-deals-black-friday-2993085)**\n  * **[Xbox One Black Friday deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-xbox-one-deals-2993078)**\n  * [**Dyson Black Friday deals**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/dyson-deals-black-friday-2942479)\n  * [**Coffee Machine Black Friday deals**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/cheap-coffee-machines-on-sale-3472986)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## 2) **Black Friday shopping tips – i** t’s not just tech that’s for sale\n\nFar from it! Black Friday sees pretty much everything under the sun\ndiscounted, so whether you’re looking to stock your cellar with some choice\ntipples ahead of Christmas or bag a great deal on toys to stick under the\ntree, the November shopping extravaganza has something to you.\n\nIn particular, we’d recommend paying attention to savings on mobile phone and\nbroadband contracts, as well as TV packages and streaming devices. Prices\ntypically plummet around Black Friday, but rather than enjoying a one-off\nsaving, you’ll be saving all year round.\n\n  * **[Broadband Black Friday deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/broadband-deals-uk-3344261)**\n  * **[Mobile phone Black Friday deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/mobile-phone-deals-3529473)**\n  * **[SIM-only Black Friday deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-sim-only-deals-uk-2943877)**\n  * **[iPhone Black Friday deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/iphone-black-friday-deals-3597079)**\n  * **[Fire TV and Fire TV Stick Black Friday deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/amazon-fire-tv-deals-3409997)**\n  * **[Apple TV Black Friday deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-apple-tv-deals-3244411)**\n  * **[Chromecast Black Friday deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/chromecast-deals-2993413)**\n\n![iPhone XS 3/4 view on\nwood](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## 3) Black Friday shopping tips – know your retailers\n\nMost retailers go hard on Black Friday, but some stand out from the crowd with\nthe breadth of the savings on offer.\n\nWith that in mind, the key retailers to look out for this year during Black\nFriday in the UK are:\n\n  * **[Amazon Black Friday deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/amazon-black-friday-2993188)**\n  * **[Currys PC World Black Friday deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/currys-pc-world-deals-black-friday-2940461)**\n  * **[Argos Black Friday deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/argos-deals-black-friday-2993228)**\n  * **[John Lewis Black Friday deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/john-lewis-deals-black-friday-2940065)**\n  * **[eBay Black Friday deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/ebay-discount-code-black-friday-2942632)**\n  * [**Asda Black Friday deals**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-asda-deals-3334832)\n\nOur US readers should keep a close eye on the following outlets:\n\n  * **[Walmart Black Friday deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/walmart-black-friday-3594113)**\n  * **[Best Buy Black Friday deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-buy-black-friday-3594122)**\n  * **[Target Black Friday deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/target-black-friday-3592904)**\n\n![black friday\ntips](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nImage Credit: Mike Mozart\n[via](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jeepersmedia/14787245911/in/photolist-o7cSBE-4QdJYH-\nowGv2H-adaKoH-E6W75a-5pTjhV-VVuyLU-7TPpvM-rk7MU-nPNVMC-8vEXkh-9dEUm7-hYaGrT-\nnkWqZY-n9R1wo-nWUQ4Q-nPQvSg-9FaKqg-48uLHV-o7cT4m-nSedc9-diKkx6-cbxRiY-\ndCgi7w-2aMHKHP-3tKXgm-4Tapdw-aeQhTt-6uTygi-Qzgp2-7WhzbY-akQv34-axmvaf-FmRyGb-\ndHvkzp-5CbcTW-8yo7ut-8nnv7V-9K4bGg-bkB2Lo-ahsP8v-6aLbzp-\nEFmdeD-99Ra4S-4QBGvW-6vwwiV-fnytjs-28aqrwa-7Q8Eij-5aQJG2) Flickr\n\n## **4) Black Friday shopping tips – get Amazon Prime for free**\n\nWhile we’re obviously excited to see what the likes of Currys, John Lewis and\nArgos are getting ready to price slash, you could quite happily do all your\nBlack Friday shopping on Amazon without missing out.\n\nAmazon gives its Prime subscribers a helpful head-start on many of its deals\nand often deliver exclusive prices for Prime members. Prime subscribers also\nenjoy a host of other benefits, including Prime Music and Prime Video,\nunlimited one-day deliveries, and more. If it’s within your budget, it’s well\nworth trying out, and you can get a free 30-day trial to see if it’s for you.\n\nYou can sign up for a free 30-day Amazon Prime trial\n[here](http://amzn.to/2jvIffB). If you don’t need Prime right now, it’s worth\nwaiting until November to sign up for a trial so it coincides with Black\nFriday.\n\n![Amazon Easter\nSale](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## **5) Black Friday shopping tips – use price-tracking tools**\n\nNot all Black Friday deals are created equal, and for every genuinely great\nbargain out there, there’s a right ol’ lemon hoping to mug you of your hard-\nearned cash.\n\nFortunately, it’s easy to safeguard yourself – and your wallet – against such\nploys.\n\nYou’ll want to have a good price-tracking tool in your Black Friday arsenal,\nand our favourite right now is the Chrome extension\n[Keepa](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keepa-amazon-price-\ntracke/neebplgakaahbhdphmkckjjcegoiijjo?hl=en). This embeds a historical graph\ninto each and every Amazon product page, letting you see what price it’s been\nselling at in the past.\n\nThis way, you can see if you’re getting a genuine bargain. You’ll instantly be\nable to see if it’s the lowest price it’s ever been sold or if it’s been a\nlong time since it’s last discount. Also useful is seeing if the price was\nrecently hiked up in order to give you a misleading discount. It also shows\nyou the price history across Amazon Warehouse and third-party sellers, too.\n\nIf you’re not a Chrome user, there is also\n[CamelCamelCamel](https://uk.camelcamelcamel.com/). Drop any Amazon link in\nits search box and you’ll see the highest, lowest, and average price of\nwhatever product you’re interested in, giving you a proper bird’s-eye view of\nthe ‘deal’ you’re looking at.\n\nNo, it won’t win any design awards, but between the basic search functionality\nand all the [useful add-ons](http://uk.camelcamelcamel.com/tools) you can\nutilise – from Twitter alerts to Amazon List synchronisation and browser\nextensions – CamelCamelCamel is nigh on indispensable.\n\n![Fitbit Blaze Historical\nPrice](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nFitbit Blaze Historical Price\n\n## **6) Black Friday shopping tips – download all the apps you can find**\n\nWith deals coming and going in the blink of an eye, you need to be ready to\njump on the best bargains as soon as they land. That means arming your mobile\ndevices with the right apps ahead of Black Friday.\n\nPretty much all major UK retailers (and their US counterparts) offer dedicated\napps for Android and iOS, so stockpile your home screen with all your\nfavourite stores. We’d recommend Amazon, John Lewis, Currys and Argos as a\nbare minimum. Many of these will give you push notifications to let you know\nwhen sales begin or products you’re interested in are discounted.\n\n![Apps](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## **7) Black Friday shopping tips – get the espresso machine ready**\n\nBlack Friday deals literally run around the clock, so the truly committed to\nbargain hunting are rewarded with the big savings. This might mean burning the\nmidnight oil in the name of a discount, as there will be some great deals late\ninto the evening, if not straight through to the early hours.\n\nAmazon in particular is fond of scheduling some big deal drops for the early\nhours, so you’ll want to break out the espresso shots if you want to avoid\ndisappointment. Some deals will appear out of nowhere with no warning, so you\ndon’t want to get caught unawares.\n\nArgos as already said that the quietest time to shop is 3am to 4am on Black\nFriday, so if you’re looking for the most stress-free time to not be fighting\nto get on the Argos site, that might be your best bet.\n\nWe’ll have a team monitoring deals into the most ungodly of hours so you can\nalways keep your sights locked to _Trusted Reviews_ if you want to stay on top\nof the best Black Friday deals.\n\n**Related:[Best coffee machines](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\ncoffee-machines-3430237)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## **8) Black Friday shopping tips – check the returns policy and warranty**\n\nIf you’re slightly undecided about whether or not you want something in the\nBlack Friday sales – but simply can’t resist a bargain – be sure to check the\nreturns policy. Provided the returns policy allows a hassle-free return, you\ncan always decide later on.\n\nFactor in whether or not you need to cover the cost of shipping a product back\nto the retailer, however, otherwise your indecisiveness can leave you out of\npocket.\n\nAlso, don’t forget about the warranty on any prospective purchases. You’ll\ntypically get a year as standard, but retailers like John Lewis often give you\nan extended warranty. On a big ticket purchase like a TV this can really add a\nlot of value.\n\nMany of John Lewis’ TV deals have a five-year warranty, which gives you a lot\nof peace of mind. This is on top of price-matching its rivals, so in this case\nopting for John Lewis is a no-brainer for the extra customer service.\n\n![John\nLewis](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## **9) Black Friday shopping tips – save yourself some of the hassle**\n\nWe’ve survived more Black Fridays than most here at _Trusted Reviews,_ so we\nknow our way around the hysteria.
