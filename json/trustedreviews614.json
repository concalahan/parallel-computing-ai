We’ll be re-reviewing the Apple Watch 3 to\nreflect its new position in the market._\n\n## What is the Apple Watch 3?\n\nApple Watch is now in its third iteration, and while it may appear that not\nmuch has changed on the surface, there have been some developments under the\nhood.\n\nThe big draw for the Series 3 is the option of LTE connectivity. This means\ngreater independence from your paired iPhone, and always-on connectivity\nwherever you get network coverage. The best news of all is that your Apple\nWatch 3 will share the same phone number as your iPhone, doing away with one\nof the biggest grievances of previous LTE-enabled smartwatches: juggling\nmultiple numbers.\n\n**Related:[Apple Watch 4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-\nwatch-4-release-date-features-rumours-3487177)**\n\nIf you’re in the UK then it’s worth noting that only EE supports LTE\nconnectivity for the Apple Watch Series 3, and this will cost £5 in addition\nto your standard monthly network tariff. The feature is more widely supported\nby US carriers and you can expect to pay an extra $10 on top of your usual\ncontract for a smartwatch plan. It seems odd that nearly a year after release\nyou can still only use the LTE functionality if you’re on EE in the UK.\n\n**Related:[Apple Watch Series 3 vs Apple Watch Series\n2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/apple-watch-series-2-vs-samsung-\ngear-s3-2940144)**\n\n![Apple Watch Series\n3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nWhile the Apple Watch 3 GPS + Cellular (£399/$399) offers the full raft of new\nfeatures, there’s also the Apple Watch 3 GPS (£329/$329) model for\nconsideration. This does away with the cellular capabilities but includes all\nthe other improvements over the now discontinued [Apple Watch Series\n2.](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/apple-watch-2) It has half the\nstorage capacity (8GB) of the Cellular model, and launches at a lower price\nthan last year’s model (originally costing £369). It’s potentially a more\ntantalising prospect for those not enamoured by LTE or a hiked up monthly\nbill.\n\nUltimately, the Apple Watch 3 remains a difficult sell as a must-have device –\neven if I do find myself missing it when I take it off. But, whether or not\nyou feel the need to be always connected, the Apple Watch Series 3 – in both\nits guises – offers the best smartwatch experience to date. While not perfect,\nit delivers a welcome balance of smartwatch convenience and fitness tracking\nto make it a versatile companion.\n\n## Apple Watch 3 – Design and comfort\n\nAs mentioned, not a great deal has changed in terms of the Apple Watch’s\ndesign. While nearly every other smartwatch maker has transitioned to a\ncircular design, Apple has stayed the course since the device’s launch in\n2015. For me, the Apple Watch 3 remains one of the more tasteful smartwatch\ndesigns out there.\n\nEach iteration of the device has seen its thickness creep up, but it’s such a\nnegligible amount that you’ll only notice if you place each model side by\nside. Consider the hardware enhancements being packed into newer models, and\nit’s really an impressive feat of engineering that the Apple Watch 3 remains\none of the more svelte smartwatches.\n\nIn the Watch Series 3, the LTE antenna has been squeezed in behind the screen,\nbarely impacting the device’s overall thickness. The positive side effect of\nthis move, which may come as a surprise, concerns comfort. In other LTE-\nenabled smartwatches, the antenna has often been placed inside the strap\njoint, making the join with the watch casing stiff and uncomfortable. This\nisn’t an issue with the Watch Series 3.\n\n![Apple Watch Series\n3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nApple has also opted to include an eSIM, which is physically smaller than a\nnano-SIM. The embedded eSIM isn’t a component you’ll ever need to swap out;\ninstead, changing providers is done on the network’s side. Setting up the\nApple Watch 3 for LTE usage is completed through the Watch app on your iPhone.\nIt takes you through the process of signing up to a smartwatch plan with your\nprovider, which in my case meant adding the £5 Smartwatch Plan on top of my\nongoing EE contract.\n\n**Related:[What is an eSIM?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/what-is-\nan-e-sim-2926904)**\n\nIf you don’t go through this part of the setup process then your Apple Watch\nwon’t make use of its LTE modem. Instead, it will operate much like the\ncheaper Apple Watch Series 3 + GPS model – although you’ll have the option of\nsigning up for an LTE data plan at a later date (perhaps when other UK network\nproviders get on board).\n\nBeyond the thickness of the device, the only other visual separator from the\nWatch Series 2 is in fact only present if you opt for the LTE-enabled model.\nThe Apple Watch’s Digital Crown gets a splash of colour, with a red dot\ndenoting your always connected capability.\n\nIs this visual flourish really necessary? Probably not. But I’ll hazard a\nguess that some folk will secretly enjoy letting the world know that they have\nthe latest and greatest adorning their wrist. Personally, I actually quite\nlike the slight visual break offered by the red dot. Especially on the silver\naluminium model I have for review, which has spent most of its time paired\nwith a Fog grey silicone sports band.\n\n![Apple Watch Series\n3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nBelow the Digital Crown is the side button that’s been re-appropriated in use\nover the years. It can now either bring up your dock of favourite apps or your\nmost recently used apps. The other side of the watch casing houses the speaker\nand microphones. Flip the watch over and the optical heart rate monitor is\nstill present.\n\nLike the Series 2, the display is made of what Apple calls ‘Ion-X strengthened\nglass’. I’ve accidentally bashed last year’s aluminium model on every\nimaginable surface, and put it through various workouts and swims, and it\nremains blemish-free. I’m confident this year’s model will live up to the same\nrigours.\n\nAs with previous models, there’s a dizzying array of Apple Watch 3 versions\navailable for every taste and budget. The LTE model is available in both 38mm\n(£399/$329) and 42mm (£429/$429) size options, and these come in Silver, Space\nGrey or Gold aluminium finishes. Then there are the more premium stainless\nsteel finishes starting from £599/$599 for the 38mm model. Watch Edition\nmodels are now available in either white or grey ceramic, with prices starting\nat £1,299/$1,299. Top these all off with returning collaborations with Hermés\nand Nike, and the number of options remain plentiful.\n\n**Related:[Best smartwatch](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nsmartwatch)**\n\n![Apple Watch Series\n3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nThis doesn’t include the range of different bundled strap options at time of\npurchase, which also impacts the price. The good news is that you’re able to\nswap out the straps at a later date. I was provided a Burnt Orange Woven Nylon\nstrap for review too, which added a bit more pizzazz compared to the more\nsubdued grey silicone strap I typically wore for exercise and swimming. The\nstandard Sport band bundle includes two different-sized straps in the box.\n\nI also tried on the Sport Loop, one of the new straps introduced with the\nApple Watch Series 3 (but compatible across all models). It’s made from a\nslightly elastic fabric and uses a hook and loop fixing, similar to the\npremium Milanese loop, to secure around your wrist. Since it’s slightly\nstretchy, I found it super-comfortable and great if you want to quickly adjust\nthe tightness depending on the situation – you’ll want a snugger fit during\nexercise for more accurate heart rate tracking, for instance.\n\n![EdgeGear\nShift](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nFor avid runners, there’s the [EdgeGear Shift](https://www.getedgegear.com/),\nwhich I’ve also been using for longer runs. Rather than having the Apple Watch\non your wrist, it actually moves it to the back of your hand, just below your\nthumb. It’s unorthodox but it makes for a much more natural way to quickly\nview the display without having to rotate your wrist.\n\nAll models of the Apple Watch 3 remain water-resistant to 50m and will happily\nsurvive a dunk in salt water, too. The new model uses the same charming water-\nejection method as the Series 2, where it will play a specific tone to eject\nwater from the speaker.\n\n[ Next  \nDisplay, Speaker and LTE Performance\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/apple-watch-3-display-lte-\nperformance)\n\n"}
