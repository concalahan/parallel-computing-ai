For the **Season 6 Week 3 challenges**\nwe’ll be reviving teammates, throwing tomatoes at people (because why the heck\nnot?) and trying to run as fast as we can from Risky Reels to Wailing Woods.\n\nThis week also sees the return of the Timed Trials. If you missed them the\nfirst time around, these tasks have you racing through checkpoints in an\nallotted time. If there anything like the last batch, there’s a chance you’ll\nneed patience and a certain amount of planning. If you’re asking yourself\nwhere exactly all the Timed Trials are, don’t worry, _Trusted Reviews_ has a\ncompiled a quick and easy guide that will help you complete Fortnite Season\n6’s third week of challenges.\n\nTo the challenge-mobile!\n\n## Fortnite Season 6 – Free Battle Pass Challenges\n\n**Revive a player in different matches 0/5**\n\nMore easy challenges. If you regularly play duos or squads, this will unlock\nnaturally, but you may need to revive teammates while also defending against\nother players. If you’re looking for an easier solution, head over to 50v50.\nPlayers go down a lot, and there’s normally enough space between you and the\nenemy team to build a one-by-one around your revive and resurrect them without\nany opposition.\n\n**Stage 1: Search a chest in Lonely Lodge 0/1**\n\nThis is a staged challenge, so we’ll have more details later today. For Lonely\nLodge, there are several chests hidden in the upstairs walls of the main\nhouse, but every man and his Bonesy will be going for them. Instead, it may be\nworth aiming for the smaller huts and checking the roofs. Just run up to the\nhuts, jump, and if you hear the chest hum, you’re safe to build up and smash\nthe roof. The other staged locations that need searching this week are Retail\nRow, Snobby Shores, Fatal Fields, and Pleasent Park.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\n**Damage Trap Eliminations (HARD) 0/1**\n\nThe damage trap, for those who aren’t aware, is the spike trap. This one may\nsound difficult, but there is a tried and tested method.\n\nOnce you’ve found a trap, head inside a house through the front door. Ready\nthe trap and place it directly above the front door. Next head back outside\nand close the door behind you. Make as much noise as possible, and when\nsomeone starts to engage with you, leg it back into the house; slamming the\ndoor behind you to hide the trap. Your victim, as they always do, will chase\nafter you and run straight into the trap as they enter through the door.\nEmoting afterwards is entirely optional.\n\n**Related:[Best Nintendo Switch\nGames](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/nintendo-switch-games-3435122)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Fortnite Season 6 – Paid Battle Pass Challenges\n\n**Stage 1: Visit Risky Reels and Wailing Woods in a single match 0/1**\n\nAnother easy one, although this will mean having to fight out of one area then\nfight into the next. Or, you know, grab an ATK from Lazy Links and just drive\nthrough both areas. Minimal fighting, minimal fuss. For the other areas, the\nATK method works, as does using rifts (or rift in a cans).\n\n**Stage 2: Visit Dusty Divot and Paradise Palms in a single match**\n\n**Stage 3: Visit Greasy Grove and Leaky Lake in a single match**\n\n**Stage 4: Visit Lucky Landing and Tilted Towers in a single match**\n\n**Stage 5: Visit Snobby Shores and Salty Springs in a single match**\n\n**Hit a player with a tomato 15m away or more 0/1**\n\nThis is will be a lot easier if you down your opponent first, walk back a\nshort distance, then lob a tomato at them. It’s also definitely worth setting\nyour emote at the start of the match. That way it’s just a case of pressing a\nbutton rather than having to cycle through all the different emotes to find\nthe one you need.\n\n**Complete timed trials (HARD) 0/3**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nTimed trials are fairly easy once you know what you’re doing. The trick is to\ntry it out first, then place ramps before restarting the trial. That way all\nyou need to do after you hit start is run a pre-made course. This goes without\nsaying, but 50v50 will make this challenge much, much easier to accomplish.\nThe fewer enemies the better.\n\nThe locations from above are as follow:\n\n  * The West side of the main tower in Tomato Temple\n  * The mountain up and right from Snobby (not the Skyrim area)\n  * The bridge South-East of Shift Shafts\n\n**Eliminate an opponent in different matches 0/10**\n\nKill, kill, and kill. Experiment with which game mode nets you the higher\nchance of at least one kill and spam that 10 times. Saying that, it’d probably\nbe best to ignore this challenge and just play the game as you normally would.\nIt’ll happen naturally, and you won’t need to get stressed if you play a match\nwith zero kills.\n\nIf you’ve still yet to complete [last week’s\nchallenges](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-complete-the-\nseason-6-week-2-challenges-3597851), we’ve got a guide for that.
