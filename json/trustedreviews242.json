It’s an open-\nworld RPG played from mainly a first-person perspective, players can expect a\nwide departure from The Witcher 3.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n## Cyberpunk 2077 release date – When is it coming out?\n\nSince development is still in the early stages, a release date for Cyberpunk\n2077 remains unconfirmed. CD Projekt Red has said it hopes to launch in 2019\nat the earliest, and it refuses to let itself be hurried, and this has been\nmade apparent throughout E3 2018.\n\nPerhaps the recent gameplay demonstration is a vertical slice as opposed to a\npart of the finished project? In terms of platforms, it’s currently confirmed\nfor [PS4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/playstation-4-review), [Xbox\nOne](https://www.trustedreviews.com/xbox-one-s-review) and\n[PC.](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-pc-games_round-up)\n\n## Cyberpunk 2077 story – What’s it about?\n\nCyberpunk 2077 is set in an open-world metropolis known as Night City, where\nmega-corporations have surpassed any democratically elected government in\ncontrolling the lives of citizens. Multiple criminal factions are vying for\ncontrol. You’re a cyberpunk, working outside of the system to build a life for\nyourself, and trying to not get killed in the process.\n\n## Cyberpunk 2077 trailer – How does it look?\n\n**Related:[Battlefield\n5](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/battlefield-5-release-date-news-\ngameplay-3231890) **\n\nThis in-engine trailer was proceeded by a brief teaser trailer which you can\nwatch below.\n\n**Related:[Best PC Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-pc-\ngames)**\n\n## Cyberpunk 2077 Gameplay Preview — How does it play?\n\nWe had a decent look at the world during Microsoft’s conference, but it wasn’t\nuntil our behind closed doors gameplay demonstration that we got a chance to\nsee how the game actually plays.\n\nThis was a hands-off experience where a member of the CD Projekt Red team\nguided us through a couple of the first-person game’s early missions. We got\nto see how it played in the moment to moment, as well as the different paths\nyou can take through its missions.\n\nWhereas previous CD Projekt Red RPGs have limited you to playing as a single\ncharacter, Geralt, who you couldn’t customise in appearance, Cyberpunk will\ngive you complete control of your character. You can choose to be either a\nmale or a female cyberpunk, and you can also tweak more granular features such\nas hair type and colour, as well as adding tattoos. You’ll still be called ‘V’\nthough, that part doesn’t change.\n\n**Related:[Final Fantasy 7 Remake](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/final-\nfantasy-7-remake-release-date-2993127) **\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAlthough you’ll pick your characters opening stats, as well as a mysterious\n‘origin’ that defines your background, the developers were keen to emphasise\nthat there are no classes in the game and that you can modify your stats\nthroughout the experience to fit any play style.\n\nThe game is set in ‘Night City’, a dystopian megacity filled with flying cars,\nskyscrapers, and — of course — organised crime.\n\nFactions war for control of the city, and fight back against the mega-\ncorporations that have usurped any democratically elected government to hold\nthe majority of the world’s resources.\n\nIt seems like the game will rely on you keeping various factions in this city\nhappy as you play. Early on in the demo, we were shown a faction leader called\n‘Drax’, who gave us a job tracking down a stolen piece of military hardware\nand getting it into his criminal hands.\n\nAlthough we got the impression you could go after the street gang yourself,\nour demonstrator chose to involve a corporate agent in the mission’s story in\norder to procure the funds to simply purchase the bot from the gang.\n\nThis solution seemed to offer the best of both worlds by keeping both factions\nhappy, but the demonstrator was keen to point out that angering one or both of\nthem would come with its own advantages. For example, we could have simply\ntaken the money given to us by the corporate agent, and fled to use it to\npurchase some tasty gear for ourselves.\n\n**Related:[The Last of Us 2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/last-of-\nus-2-release-date-gameplay-trailer-pre-order-news-wishlist-2944236) **\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nWe only got a small look at the gear that’s available in the game, but it\nlooks like there’s a huge combination of guns to buy, upgrades you can\npurchase for existing guns, and implants you can purchase to enhance your own\nabilities.\n\nThese implants form a key part of the lore of Cyberpunk 2077. Scavenger gangs\nkidnap people with particularly powerful implants in order to harvest and sell\nthem on, while other gangs choose to mutilate themselves with the most extreme\nimplants available.\n\nOne particularly gross set of enemies had half their faces missing so that\nthey could install a Splinter Cell-style set of glowing red eyes. 2077 is a\ndirty and messy world, and it’s every bit the adult-focussed experience we’ve\ncome to expect from a developer like Projekt Red.\n\nYou can get these tech upgrades for yourself by visiting ‘Ripper Docs’, NPCs\nequipped with the tools to rip out your eyes and replace them with better\nmodels (our demonstrator’s new optics had the ability to zoom in and scan\nobjects for example), or maybe just install a better gun grip in your hand to\nlet you handle your weapons more easily.\n\n**Related:[Gears 5](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/gears-of-war-5-news-\nrelease-date-2949338)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nOnce we got into the meat of the mission, it left no doubt in our minds that\nthis is a firm hybrid between RPG and shooter, rather than a shooter with RPG\nelements.\n\nShooting enemies causes numbers to fly from them, showing you the amount of\nyour damage you’re doing, and at various points in the mission our\ndemonstrator found panels and doors that they didn’t have the hacking skills\nto be able to crack open.\n\nLater on, thanks to a bit of behind the scenes developer tweaking, we were\nshown a series of enhanced abilities, such as the ability to bounce bullets of\nwalls or see and shoot people behind cover.\n\nIt all sounds a lot like Deus Ex, and certainly, Cyberpunk 2077 owes a lot to\nthis classic sci-fi franchise, but the execution of its open world puts it in\nanother league entirely.\n\n**Related:** **[Forza Horizon 4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/forza-\nhorizon-4-release-date-gameplay-3382198) **\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThere’s so much going on in every single frame we saw of Night City, from\nhover-cars flying overhead to police investigating holographic records of\ncrimes by the side of the road.\n\nIts size becomes more apparent when you hop in your companion Jackie’s car —\nalthough the demo suggested you’ll get your own later on. You can either drive\nfrom a first- or third-person perspective, but we think we’ll be opting for\nthe latter because of how great the designs of the vehicles are.\n\nThere was no sign of getting to pilot a hover car for ourselves, but we’ve got\nour fingers crossed that we’ll get a flying Blade Runner-style spinner later\non in the game.\n\n## First impressions\n\nThere’s so much more to talk about with Cyberpunk 2077, from the way you’ll\nseamlessly interact with the computers in its world, to the way you can\nsilently take down enemies and hack into their minds to gain a competitive\nadvantage against the rest of their gang.\n\nYes, many of these ideas aren’t new, but CD Projekt Red is approaching the\ntitle with a level of world-building finesse and, importantly, budget, that\nlooks like it will put the game into a similar league as The Witcher 3 when it\nreleases (a 2019 date is expected, but nothing has been officially confirmed).\n\nWe can’t wait to get the chance to play the game for ourselves.\n\n_**What would you like to see in Cyberpunk 2077?
