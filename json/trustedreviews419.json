But should you buy Rippe (XRP), Litecoin or\nEthereum? Recent data from two popular digital currency tracking sites can\nhelp you decide. As can insider warnings…**\n\nThe biggest rising crypto-star of 2017 was XRP aka Ripple,\n[according](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ripple/) to data from\nCoinMarketCap. It started 2017 worth a measly $0.0065 per coin (unit?), but\nwas valued at $2.47 by the end of the year –a Herculean 37,000% increase.\n\nIt also enjoys the second largest market capitalisation behind Bitcoin and is\nnow valued at $142bn overall. Bitcoin tots up a $251.4bn market cap, by way of\ncomparison.\n\nEthereum and Litecoin also performed exceptionally well in 2017.\n\nFigures from Coinbase [show](https://www.coinbase.com/charts?locale=en) that\nEthereum, which is currently hovering just shy of the $1000 mark at time of\npublication, surged by over 9240% last year. Its market cap now sits at around\n$100.6bn.\n\nLitecoin ($13.2bn market cap), for its part, grew by more than 5195% year-on-\nyear, and was hovering just over $245 on the morning of Friday, January 5\n\nTo put this all into context, a single Bitcoin will set you back some $15,550\ntoday.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThese are the cryptocurrency world’s three fastest risers, and those wanting\nto dabble without could do worse than to snap up a few still-affordable XRPs.\nLitecoin and Ethereum are arguably bigger names and will set you back more,\nbut if Bitcoin’s rise and rise is anything to go by, they could still be far\nfrom their ceiling and also represent good alternatives to consider.\n\nHowever, know that the value of digital currencies are subject to major\nfluctuations – far more pronounced than physical monies – and high-profile\ncryptocurrencies have been known to completely crash in the past.\n\nLike any ‘investment’, a certain amount of risk is involved and you should\nonly part with what you can afford to lose.\n\n## Bitcoin alternatives to consider avoiding\n\nWhich brings us to…our one you might want to avoid.\n\nDogecoin was originally devised as a Bitcoin piss-take, but humorously\nintended or not, its value has soared over the years, with the cryptocurrency\nenjoying a market cap well in excess of $1.5bn when at the time of our last\nupdate.\n\nHowever, its creator says he is ‘worried’ about the future of the digital\ncurrency and believes that the current crypto-bubble will “inevitably” burst.\n\nTaking to Twitter, Jackson Palmer\n[wrote](https://twitter.com/ummjackson/status/949313802994008064):\n\n> “I haven’t held a substantial amount of dogecoin since early-2015 so the\nmarket cap doesn’t mean a lot to me – it does however act as a barometer for\ncrypto mania and speculation…I have a lot of faith in the dogecoin core\ndevelopment team to keep the software stable and and secure, but I think it\nsays a lot about the state of the cryptocurrency space in general that a\ncurrency with a dog on it which hasn’t released a software update in over 2\nyears has a $1B+ market cap…I think it’s relatively safe to label the current\nmarket as a ‘bubble’, although it’s hard to predict how much it’ll inflate and\nfor how long before it inevitably bursts.”\n\nHe adds: “My one hope is that when that does happen and people lose large sums\nof money, the negativity in the market doesn’t stifle technological innovation\nor interest in digital currency from the mainstream.”\n\nThat’s not to say you shouldn’t dabble in cryptocurrency investment; just\nthat, as we’ve already said, there’s a hefty amount of uncertainty involved.\n\nThe new Gold Rush this may well be – but as with the one of yesteryear,\nthere’ll be plenty of Fool’s Gold doing the rounds alongside the real deal.\n\n**Got any hot tips for Bitcoin alternatives?
