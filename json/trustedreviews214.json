Even if you change network providers, you can keepyour old phone number.To port your old number between providers, you’ll need to contact your oldprovider and ask for something called a PAC code. This stands for PortAuthorising Code. Once you have this, just contact your new provider and theycan handle the transfer of your number. This usually takes about 24 hours.You usually have 30 days to give your new provider the PAC code, as they tendto expire after this period. Fear not, you can always request a new PAC._We may earn a commission if you click a deal and buy an item.
