We take a look.**\n\nNot only are CDs dying, so too is downloading; and while vinyl continues to\nmake a comeback, most people are getting their music fix via streaming.\n\nThere’s no shortage of options in that department, either. Spotify and Apple\nMusic are two of the big names in this field, but there are also options such\nas Jay Z’s Tidal and Amazon’s own offering.\n\nTo make things a bit more complicated, Amazon’s music streaming service comes\nin two flavours: Amazon Music Unlimited and Amazon Prime Music. What’s the\ndifference? Well if you’re in a rush the short answer is: you get more songs\nwith the Unlimited option. But we know you want this thing dissected in\ndetails, so here’s what you need to know.\n\n## Amazon Music Unlimited vs Prime Music – Price\n\nFirst up, the all-important price. You can get access to Prime Music by\nsigning up for Amazon Prime. That’ll cost you £79 a year or £7.99 a month (if\nyou’re planning on sticking with Prime for 12 months it’s worth going for the\nannual subscription as you’ll save around £20 – just remember to cancel it\nbefore it auto-renews).\n\nThe benefit here is that you’ll get access to all the other Prime perks, such\nas one-day delivery on thousands of items from Amazon’s store, access to the\nPrime Video streaming service, and a whole load more. Best of all, you can try\nit for free for 30-days to see if it’s right for you.\n\n  * [**Get a free 30-day Amazon Prime trial here**  \n](http://amzn.to/2ubW6Yj)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nSo, how much more will Amazon Music Unlimited cost you? Well, the monthly\nprice remains the same at £7.99 for the standard tier – you’ll have to already\nbe a Prime member to get this price, though.\n\nIf you aren’t signed up to Prime alreay, you can still set up a Music\nUnlimited account but you’ll have to pay £9.99 a month. If you go for this\noption, remember, you won’t be getting all the added extras that come with\nPrime membership.\n\n**Related:[Netflix vs Amazon Prime Instant\nVideo](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/netflix-vs-amazon-prime-\ninstant-video)**\n\n![Amazon\nlogo](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nWe’d recommend signing up for Prime and then adding Music Unlimited as an\nextra option if you’re looking to take Amazon up on its full music streaming\noffer. That works out to £15.98 per month for Prime membership and access to\nthe full music streaming catalogue – not a bad deal.\n\nBut that’s not all. There are a few more subscription options to choose from\nwhen it comes to Amazon Music Unlimited. First, if you own an Amazon Echo\nsmart speaker, the company will let you sign up for just £3.99 a month **.**\nThat means you’ll be able to listen to the full Unlimited catalogue, but only\nthrough ONE of your smart speakers – whether that’s an Echo, [Echo\nDot](https://www.trustedreviews.com/amazon-echo-dot-review-review), or Echo\nTap. ****\n\nEven with that limitation, it’s a decent offer, so if you fancy giving it a go\njust say “Alexa, try Amazon Music Unlimited” in range of your speaker and it\nwill start the sign up process.  \n **  \n**Next up, there’s the option of the family plan, which costs £14.99 a month\nor £149 for the annual subscription, though, if you’re not signed up to a\nPrime membership, you’ll only have the option of paying monthly. Going for the\nfamily plan means you and five others can make use of all the Music Unlimited\nbenefits, including individual accounts and recommendations. ****\n\nRelated: [Amazon Echo review](https://www.trustedreviews.com/amazon-echo-\nreview)\n\n## Amazon Music Unlimited vs Prime Music – Catalogue\n\nSo, you know how much it all costs, but what are you actually getting for your\nmoney? Obviously, the Unlimited service provides more songs and features, but\nwith Prime Music, you still get access to two million songs. As Amazon puts\nit, the service “features two million songs and more than a thousand playlists\nand stations programmed by Amazon’s music experts.”\n\nThat basically means you’re getting a rotating selection of 2 million songs,\nthat will change depending on agreements Amazon has with various record\nlabels. How often it changes and when will depend on those contracts with\nmusic providers.\n\n**Related:[Best Amazon Prime Day\ndeals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/best-amazon-deals-uk)**\n\n![Amazon\nMusic](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAmazon Music Unlimited is the company’s attempt to take on the likes of\nSpotify and Apple music, and provides all the features and functionality of\nPrime Music. But with Unlimited, you’ll get 40 million songs and thousands of\n“expert-programmed” playlists and stations. You’ll also get new releases from\nartists as they become available (unless a particular artist strikes a deal\nwith other streaming services for exclusivity).\n\n## Amazon Music Unlimited vs Prime Music – Apps and accessibility  \n\nAccessing your music, whether you’re a Prime Music or Unlimited subscriber is\neasy. If you’re a Prime member, you can stream tracks and albums directly\nthrough the Amazon site just by clicking the “Listen Now” button when you see\nit on any music product, whether that’s an album or single etc.\n\nWhat’s more, you’ll also be able to add Prime Music to your Amazon Music\nLibrary, which lets you stream it through the Amazon Music App. You’ll also be\nable to access Amazon Music Unlimited through both the web player and the app.\n\nSo, what is the Amazon Music App actually like? The company has refined the\ninterface in recent years, so it’s a lot better than it used to be. What’s\nmore, you can get the app for pretty much any platform you can image, from\nyour phone to your tablet to your car – not to mention the Amazon Echo\nfunctionality. Here’s the links for the mobile version.\n\n**Amazon\nMusic:[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.mp3&hl=en)\n| [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/amazon-music/id510855668?mt=8)**\n\n![amazon\necho](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)_Amazon Music works with the Echo smart speaker_ **  \n**\n\n## Amazon Music Unlimited vs Prime Music – Features  \n\nFirstly, it’s worth noting that both Amazon Prime Music and Music Unlimited\nallow you to stream music ad-free. But there’s a host of other features that\nare worth checking out. Here’s a rundown:\n\n**Offline**\n\nOffline playback is a big consideration when it comes to the whole streaming\nthing. After all, if you lose connection, you lose music. Fortunately, both\nAmazon Prime Music and Music Unlimited allow you to download your favourite\ntracks for listening offline. Handy!  \n **  \nRadio**\n\nLooking for personalised suggestions based on your favourite artists? Luckily,\nAmazon has provided a ‘Radio’ feature that offers personalised radio stations\nwhich serve up music that the company thinks you’ll like, based on your\nlistening history. and will be able to filter by artists, genres, and popular\ntitles. You can even search for radio stations based on a ‘mood’.\n\nYou’ll find the Radio feature in both services, but while Prime Music offers\nmore than a thousand playlists and stations, Music Unlimited comes with\nthousands.\n\n**Alexa and Echo support**\n\nAlexa is Amazon’s virtual assistant and the heart of the company’s Echo smart\nspeaker and its smaller counterparts, the Echo Dot and Tap. That means,\nwhether you’re a Prime Music user or an Unlimited subscriber, you’ll be able\nto ask Alexa to play songs based on an artist, genre or even a mood if you’re\nlistening through one of those devices.\n\nVoice commands are numerous, and include instructions such as “Alexa, play the\nnew song by Bruno Mars,” “play music for a dinner party,” or “play Led\nZeppelin’s greatest hits”.\n\n**Playlists**\n\nYou’ll be able to create your own custom playlists regardless of whether\nyou’re using Amazon Prime Music or Music Unlimited. There’s also the option to\nsave curated ones to your collection on both services.\n\n**Let us know what you think of Amazon’s music streaming services in the\ncomments.**\n\n"}
