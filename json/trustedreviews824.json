For\nstarters, it’s an aluminium drum. Then there’s the control scheme: besides a\ntouch interface built into the aluminium, Bang & Olufsen wants you to roll the\nspeaker up and down your wall to change the volume.\n\nThat’s right: a little nudge raises or lowers the volume a little while a\nstronger push yields more dramatic changes. Let go and the speaker rolls back\nto its default position, ready to go again.\n\n![Bang Olufsen Beosound\nEdge](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nYou can also set up the speaker on the floor and roll it forwards or backwards\nfor the same effect, but what’s the fun in that? More conventional control\nmethods are available via Bluetooth, Airplay 2 and Chromecast.\n\nThe audio components are just as impressive. There is a 3/4-inch tweeter and a\n4-inch midrange driver on each side of the drum for a 360-degree sound, plus a\n10″ woofer on one side. Then there’s what B&O claims is the world’s ‘first\nactive bass port’, which combined the two classical concepts of speaker\ndesign: closed box and ported structures.\n\nAt lower volumes, the speaker adheres to the closed cabinet principle for more\naccurate sound reproduction. Crank up the volume and the active bass port\nopens up to shift more air and offer a more powerful bass performance. Bang &\nOlufsen likens the Beosound Edge to fast cars, some of which have spoilers\nthat automatically rise up as the speed increases.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n**Related:[Best Bluetooth\nspeakers](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/bluetooth-speakers-3431819)**\n\n![Bang Olufsen Beosound\nEdge](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIt’s an apt analogy, since you could buy a car for the price of one of these\nspeakers: £2900/€3250/$3500.
