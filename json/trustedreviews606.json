The upcoming sci-fi RPG is a brave departure for a studio\nthat has spent years nurturing\n[Fallout](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/fallout-76-release-date-3479330)\nand [Elder Scrolls](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/elders-\nscrolls-6-trailer-release-date-2993132) into the juggernauts they are today.\nNow, this new IP is set to usher in the next generation with an experience\nwe’re hoping will be truly epic.\n\n_Trusted Reviews_ has compiled everything you need to know about Starfield\nincluding all the latest news, release date, gameplay and more.\n\n## What is Starfield?\n\nLittle is known about Starfield thus far beyond the fact it’s Bethesda’s first\nnew IP in 25 years or so. For a studio so beloved, stepping out of the box and\ndiving into something new is incredibly exciting. More information is expected\nto be revealed alongside [DOOM\nEternal](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/doom-eternal-release-\ndate-3483704) at QuakeCon 2018, although there’s been no official word as of\nyet.\n\nFrom what we know, players can expect a huge, expansive sci-fi RPG that rivals\nthe best in the genre, and one that will also take advantage of next\ngeneration hardware. Yep, that likely means\n[PS5](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ps5-release-date-price-games-news-\nrumours-specs-2993694) and [Xbox\nTwo](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/xbox-two-release-date-3408041).\nPerhaps it will compete alongside CD Projekt Red’s [Cyberpunk\n2077](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/cyberpunk-2077-release-date-\ngameplay-2948412)?\n\n## Starfield Trailer – how does it look?\n\nYou can watch the announcement trailer for Starfield from E3 2018 below:\n\n**Related:[Best PS4\nGames](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/ps4-games-3431751)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Hyperkin Xbox One Duke Controller](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n###  Hyperkin Xbox One Duke Controller\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/hyperkin-xbox-one-duke-controller\n\"Hyperkin Xbox One Duke Controller\")\n\n  * [ ![Call of Cthulhu](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Call of Cthulhu\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/call-of-cthulhu \"Call of Cthulhu\")\n\n  *   * [ ![iPad Pro 2018](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: MySmartPrice / @OnLeaks \n\n### New iPad Pro 2018 leak shows Apple is almost certainly dropping the Home\nbutton\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ipad-pro-2018-release-date-specs-\nprice-3482812 \"New iPad Pro 2018 leak shows Apple is almost certainly dropping\nthe Home button\")\n\n  * \n\n## Starfield release date – when is it coming out?\n\nThere’s no release date in sight for Starfield. However, as mentioned above,\nit will be a next or cross-generational title, so we can expect more details\nonce Sony and Microsoft lift the lid on new hardware. But when will that be?\nOur money is on sometime in 2019.\n\n## Starfield news – what’s the latest?\n\nA recent interview with\n[VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/2018/07/07/fallout-4-director-todd-\nhoward-giving-fans-what-they-want-without-spreading-too-thin/) confirmed that\nStarfield has been in development for over 10 years, and now, Bethesda is\ndedicating a full development team to finishing it. That is, as soon as\nFallout 76 launches in November 2018.\n\n“We just talked about it, and then I guess it really picked up steam — we’re\ngoing to do this, register the trademark, about five years ago,” Howard told\nVentureBeat. “Then we would talk about it from time to time during that\nperiod. What are we going to do? And we started work right after Fallout 4 was\nfinished.”\n\nBethesda received a bit of criticism following the announcement of Starfield\nand Elder Scrolls 6 due to how they’re likely several years away from release,\nwith the latter even further so. When pressed about this, Howard said, “It’s\nbetter to say we’re making it. It makes life easier for us.” Fair enough, and\nit also stops rumours from swirling around.\n\n**Are you looking forward to Starfield? Let us know on Facebook and Twitter\n@trustedreviews.**\n\n"}
