This finally puts to an\nend half a decade of gaming laptop dominance for Intel, who, along with\nNvidia, have had somewhat of a monopoly on the gaming laptop scene of late.\n\nRyzen, for the uninitiated, is AMD’s big bang-for-buck processor line. It’s\nbeen on sale as a desktop processor for a few months, but until now had been\n[notably absent from laptops](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/amd-ryzen-\nmobile-laptops-vega-performance-price-release-date \"AMD Ryzen laptops\"). Note\nthat this isn’t Ryzen Mobile, but appears to be a full-fat desktop chip. Ryzen\nMobile will come later this year on thin and light laptops.  \n **  \nRelated:[Best gaming laptop](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-gaming-\nlaptop_round-up \"best gaming laptop\")**  \n  \nThe notebook in question is the Asus ROG STRIX GL702ZC. STRIX is Asus’ mid-\nrange gaming brand, so it’s not the full-fat ROG that some have been hoping\nfor. But still, it has an eight-core Ryzen 7 1700 chip on board alongside\nAMD’s latest Radeon RX 580 GPU.\n\nWith so many cores and a mid-range GPU, this is a bit of a streamer’s dream.\nDepending on the price, this could find itself sitting nicely alongside\nlaptops powered by an Intel/Nvidia GTX 1060 combination.\n\n![Asus\nGL702VI](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe laptop’s 17.3-inch display is a Full HD IPS panel, and comes with AMD\nFreeSync on board for tear-free gaming. All in all, this is a bit of an AMD\nfan’s dream.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nWe’ll admit, it’s not a very exciting-looking laptop, but it’s what’s inside\nthat counts. Right?\n\nWe don’t have details on other specs, or even a release date at this point,\nbut expect a launch some time in the next couple of months.\n\n**Does Ryzen in a laptop get you excited?
