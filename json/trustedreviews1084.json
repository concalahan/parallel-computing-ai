It’s a\nharrowing tale of Lara coming to terms with her own morality and realising the\nvalue of friendship, although it seldom gels together in a satisfying way.\n\nThe closing chapter of Lara Croft’s reboot trilogy is a complicated one. It’s\nsimultaneously the most accomplished chapter thus far, but also continually\ntrips up under the weight of its own ambition. Whether it’s narrative, combat\nor exploration, very little in Shadow of the Tomb Raider feels as good as I’d\nlike. That isn’t to say it’s bad, it’s consistently great, but it ends up\nsitting in the shadows of its contemporaries.\n\nTroubled pacing and an odd mixture of performances kept me from getting truly\ninvested, and the absence of Rhianna Pratchett’s writing talent is most\ndefinitely felt. Arcs are established without ever being paid off in a\nmeaningful way, or otherwise prance around in limbo without being touched for\nhours. It’s frustrating. Yes, [Rise of the Tomb\nRaider](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/rise-of-the-tomb-raider) could\nfeel generic but it still managed to weave an excellent yarn regardless.\n\nThe opposite is true here. Things wrap up in a hugely anticlimactic final act\nthat fails to deliver thanks to a clumsy narrative which juggles far too many\nelements when none of them have enough depth. Lara spends time either talking\nabout her dead parents, realising her own misguided intentions or fending off\nTrinity, an evil organisation whose motivations are muddy and inconsistent.\n\n**Related:**[ **Best PS4\nGames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/ps4-games-3431751)\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Google Home Hub YouTube](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n###  Will Google Home Hub ever get Netflix?

Upon stealing an\nancient dagger, Lara is warned by her enemies of the cataclysm she’s set in\nmotion. This immediately becomes clear as a rapturous tsunami tears through\nMexico, killing thousands and leaving our heroine a battered, broken mess.\nJonah’s shoulder is the only one left to lean on, a close friend of Lara whose\nrelationship is a pleasure to bear witness to.\n\nThe relationship between Lara and Jonah is a brilliant one. It’s filled with\nhistory and a genuine care that shines through until the end. It should have\nbeen the main focus, but instead finds itself on the sidelines as multiple,\nfar less intriguing arcs are given prominence. It feels like Eidos Montreal\nwasn’t sure how to conclude this trilogy, resulting in a cavalcade of hollow\nyet lavishly produced cutscenes that take you from one set-piece to the next —\nall of which are, fortunately, an absolute joy to experience.\n\nAside from a few bespoke locations, the majority of your time will be spent in\nthe Hidden City of Paititi. Discovered in the opening hours, this ancient\nabode is positively huge, acting as the main hub area you’ll return to again\nand again as the story progresses. It’s cleverly designed and bustling with\nlife as citizens go about their daily routines. Lara is a stranger in a\nstrange land, and its occupants react accordingly.\n\nYou’ll receive questionable glances while exploring, whether peering through\nan empty household or discovering ruins that have remained untouched for\ndecades. There’s a comedic element to Lara Croft digging through primitive\nhuts like a student on her gap year, but it’s also where the greatest part of\nShadow rears its head: exploration. Stumbling across hidden crypts\n(essentially miniature tombs) to find a useful upgrade and a few tidbits of\nlore is an engaging treat, developing the game’s world in ways I didn’t\nexpect.\n\n**Related:**[ **Super Smash Bros\nUltimate**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/smash-bros-ultimate-release-\ndate-news-gameplay-2949964)\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nChallenge Tombs are the real highlight. Hugely expanded from previous games,\nthey now feel like levels within themselves as you can spend upwards of 30\nminutes trying to solve a fiendishly crafted puzzle.\n\nTomb designs can range from a crumbling Spanish Galleon amidst the boundaries\nof a cliff to a mixture of labyrinthian waterways that will enrapture you in\nseconds. Every single one is polished to perfection, idyllically placed when\nencountered throughout the story. Some are hidden away in and around Paititi,\nand you’d be doing yourself a disservice if you didn’t seek them out.\n\nEidos Montreal made a point of emphasising the sheer size of Shadow of the\nTomb Raider’s hub world prior to release, and it was worthwhile to do so. You\ncan easily lose hours finding all the hidden relics, crypts and tombs\nscattered about the place. Citizens can provide you with side quests, but\nthese are painfully boring, crippled by the same lacklustre writing weighing\ndown the main campaign. It’s sad that dialogue feels so inconsequential. The\nhistory of this city is fascinating, yet it’s hidden away in artefact\ndescriptions and rarely excels outside of them.\n\nThe solo campaign is arguably the least compelling part of the entire package.\nSpectacular action sequences aside, it’s a whistlestop tour of a world I was\nwaiting to be unleashed in. Within of seconds of unlocking the ability to fast\ntravel, I returned to previous locations to sweep up anything I missed. Doing\nso is an exercise in satisfaction, largely thanks to Lara’s upgrade\nprogression which does an excellent job of maintaining interest in the wider\nuniverse.\n\n**Related:**[ **Fallout 76 Latest\nNews**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/fallout-76-news-release-date-\ngameplay-3479330)\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSplit into three distinct skill categories, Lara can upgrade and acquire\nabilities that will become key to combat, exploration and the gathering of\nresources. Each one feels like a substantial step forward, especially if it\nresults in you now being capable of chain takedowns or firing off three arrows\nwith a flick of the shoulder button. Despite making a real difference to how\nyou play, upgrades to hunting and plant gathering feel trivial as I always had\nenough crafting components, and going out of your way to slaughter animals\nfeels largely pointless as a result.\n\nWhen Lara Croft isn’t destroying monuments or raiding tombs she’s found with\nan assault rifle in hand and endless corpses at her feet. While a little less\ngratuitous than past entries, Shadow of the Tomb Raider still takes a morbid\npleasure in Lara’s talent for slaughter. She’ll hang enemies up by treetops\nbefore slitting their throats or set them ablaze in an explosion of fire. The\ntonal shift between a timid adventurer who’s almost ashamed of her own actions\nto a mass-murdering psychopath is hard to swallow and doesn’t have the charm\nof Uncharted to help pull it off. Don’t even get me started on her death\nanimations.\n\nAt least combat is serviceable. Armed with a bow, pistol, shotgun and assault\nrifle, Lara is a force to be reckoned with as she blows away soldiers almost\ntwice her size. Weapons can be upgraded, too, providing a reason for mixing\nthings up with different attachments and quirks. A personal favourite of mine\nwas a flare attachment for pistols that could both distract foes and set the\ncheeky buggers alight. I found stealth to be the most enjoyable route, though.\n\nNearly all encounters can be conquered without a single bullet fired thanks to\nnew stealth mechanics. Lara can now cover herself in mud before sinking into a\nnearby wall, waiting for Trinity to stumble into slaughter. This feels\nfantastic and chaining together a dozen or so attacks as you hide in bushes or\natop trees never gets old. So it’s a shame that combat encounters are\nsurprisingly few and far between this time around as yet another victim of\nShadow’s mediocre pacing.\n\n**Related:**[ **Upcoming Xbox One\nGames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/upcoming-xbox-one-\ngames-2018-3531040)\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nEnemies range from cannon fodder infantry to more powerful variants you’ll\nneed to think strategically to dispatch. Those with helmets can shrug off\nheadshots while heavily armoured foes aren’t as vulnerable to stealth attacks.\nThere’s a reasonable amount of nuance here, but only if you’re willing to play\nby the game’s rules. Otherwise, a constant hail of bullets will make mincemeat\nout of anything **.**\n\nTraversal in Shadow of the Tomb Raider is a real accomplishment, even if\ncertain segments can be finicky. Climbing jagged mountain sides with your ice\npicks before precariously grappling downward into a small, tight ravine are\njust some of the vertigo-inducing sights you’ll take in.\n\nVisually, it’s a masterclass in environmental detail and genuine spectacle. I\nplayed on Xbox One X, which is capable of running things at a native 4K\nresolution with HDR alongside it. Aside from a few performance hiccups, it ran\nwithout any issues at all at 30fps. If you’re a sucker for a juicy framerate,\nthere’s an option to prioritise this above resolution to run the game at\n60fps, and it still looks wonderful.\n\n## Verdict\n\nShadow of the Tomb Raider is an enjoyable action-adventure for the most part,\nyet frequently falls victim to a haphazard narrative and structural pacing\nthat stops the trilogy’s finale from truly standing out.\n\nThe evolution that was steps away from reaching its crescendo in Rise of the\nTomb Raider is pushed aside here in favour of an experience that feels\nneedlessly disjointed, making the main campaign feel like a distraction from\nthe otherwise exceptional side content.\n\nChallenge Tombs are a joy to navigate while the ample amounts of relics and\ntreasures waiting to be found in and around the city of Paititi are a frequent\nblast to uncover. I’ll be going back for more, and I’m excited to see where\nthe series goes next, but I can’t help but feel disappointed when all’s said\nand done.\n\n## Score\n\n  \n\n"}
