It has a curved\nAMOLED display that melts into the metal and glass back and helps it sit\ncomfortably in your hand.\n\nIt’s big, yes – it’s always going to big be with a 5.7-inch display – but it’s\nnot _too_ big. If anything, it’s the smallest big phone there is thanks to its\nnarrower and taller design.\n\n**Related:[iPhone X](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-x-release-\ndate-specs-features-uk-price-2951157)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nA speaker, [USB-C](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/usb-type-c-\neverything-you-need-to-know-2932202) port, and headphone jack sit on the S8’s\nbottom, while a terribly placed fingerprint scanner lies next to the camera\nmodule on the back.\n\nThe iPhone 8 lacks the headphone jack – Apple was never going to have the\n‘courage’ to bring it back – but it does match the Samsung Galaxy S8 by being\nwater-resistant.\n\n**Related:[iPhone 9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-9-release-\ndate-specs-features-price-rumours-uk-3297160)**\n\nAt first glance, and we won’t know more until we get our hands on the phone,\nthat the Galaxy S8 is the better looking phone. The iPhone 8 looks almost like\nthe iPhone 7, but replaces the metal back for a glass one. If you want\nsomething that looks a whole lot more futuristic, the iPhone X is for you.\n\nBoth the iPhone 8 and Samsung Galaxy S8 have glass backs. This allows for them\nboth to be capable of wireless charging when paired with the right Qi-enabled\naccessory. Samsung has been doing wireless charging for years now, but the\niPhone 8 and iPhone X are the first of Apple’s device to support it.\n\n**Related:[Apple TV 4K](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/4k-apple-tv-\nrelease-date-news-rumours-specs-price-2953139)**\n\n![Galaxy S8\nsand](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAnother thing that both Samsung and Apple do is offer their flagship phones in\nmultiple flavours. Both the iPhone 8 and Galaxy S8 can be bought in larger,\nplus models. The S8 Plus has a 6.2-inch, while the iPhone 8 Plus ups the\n4.7-inch display to 5.5-inches.\n\nRegister for Galaxy S9 with\n[Mobiles.co.uk](https://public.eagleapi.io/magpie/time-inc/trusted-\nreviews/AUTO/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fnew-samsung-galaxy-\nsignup%3Faffiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1517414248_32e15a46eadfa34de4b0e1e1894ef723%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3DTimeIncCPL%26clickref%3Dtr-\nmobiledeals-s9-prereg-\ncpc&referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.trustedreviews.com%2Fnews%2Fsamsung-\ngalaxy-s9-release-date-specs-features-price-uk-3266552&) and [Carphone\nWarehouse](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=380&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-\nmobiledeals-s9-prereg-\ncpc&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.carphonewarehouse.com%2Fsamsung%2Fnext-\ngalaxy.html%3Fintcmp%3DLP_LATEST_NEXT_GALAXY_290118) to find out more about\nthe release\n\n## **Samsung Galaxy S8 vs iPhone 8 specs: Which is more powerful?**\n\nBoth of these phones offer power in swathes, and they’re sure to be two of the\nspeediest phones of 2017.\n\nSamsung has equipped the Galaxy S8 with a Snapdragon 835 processor (Exynos\n8895 in Europe) along with 4GB RAM. Apple’s iPhone 8 uses an A11 chip that\nlikely is built using the same 10nm manufacturing process as both the 835 and\nExynos 8895. Basically, a smaller manufacturing process means a more efficient\nchipset.\n\nWe don’t yet know how much RAM will be in the iPhone 8, but expect it to be\neither 2/3GB (like the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus respectively) or 4GB (like\nthe iPad Pro 2).\n\n### The top Samsung Galaxy S8 deals right now\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-S8Deals&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fsamsung-\ngalaxy-s8)\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-S8Deals&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fsamsung-\ngalaxy-s8)\n\n###\n\n[Samsung Galaxy S8 – 4GB, £23/month and £5 upfront (with code TRUSTED10) on\nVodafone\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-S8Deals&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fsamsung-\ngalaxy-s8)\n\nA fantastic offer for anyone in the market for a low data contract on a\nSamsung Galaxy S8.

The\nGalaxy S8 possess a stunning 5.7-inch AMOLED Infinity Display that stretches\nedge-to-edge like the iPhone X. It’s a quad-HD resolution screen that supports\nHDR content from the likes of YouTube, Prime Video and Netflix.\n\nThe iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, on the other hand, sticks to an IPS LCD panel with\nthe same resolutions as the previous phones. That means the 8 Plus has a 1080p\npanel, while the 8 has a resolution slightly above 720p.\n\nOn the back of the Samsung Galaxy S8 there’s a single 12-megapixel camera with\nan f/1.7 aperture. The S8’s camera is great and it capable of quickly taking\naccurate, natural looking photos without fussing with various modes. The\niPhone 8 is equipped with a 12MP camera and the iPhone 8 Plus has a dual 12MP\ncamera with an f/1.8 aperture and f/2,8 aperture.\n\nApple says the new cameras have better autofocus, built-in noise reduction and\nbigger sensors. The iPhone 8 Plus also has a new ‘Portrait Lighting’ mode that\nuses the cameras to adjust the lightning on a persons face. It sounds clever,\nbut we’ll have to wait and see how it actually works in real life.\n\n**Related:[Best iPhone 8 cases](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/best-\niphone-8-cases-3286463)**\n\n## **Samsung Galaxy S8 vs iPhone 8 Summary: What’s the difference?**\n\n**Design:** The Samsung Galaxy S8 sports an edge-to-edge display curved sides\nand curved back.
