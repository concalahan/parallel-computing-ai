The companies eventually settled, but the terms were never disclosed\npublicly.\n\nTesla has also reportedly lost a number of its engineers to Apple, which\ncompany CEO Elon Musk has previously made light of.\n\n“Important engineers? They have hired people we’ve fired,” [said Musk,\nspeaking about Apple](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/elon-musk-apple-\nhires-tesla-rejects) earlier this month. “We always jokingly call Apple the\n‘Tesla Graveyard’. If you don’t make it at Tesla, you go work at Apple. I’m\nnot kidding.”\n\nAt the time, Musk cautioned that “cars are very complex compared to phones or\nsmartwatches”.\n\nHe added: “For Apple, the car is the next logical thing to finally offer a\nsignificant innovation”, and said that “a new pencil or a bigger iPad alone\nwere not relevant enough”.\n\n**Related:[Apple Car: The biggest challenges Apple\nfaces](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/apple-car-features)**\n\nEarlier today, we reported on new analyst estimations that put the [Apple  \n  \nCar’s eventual retail price at\n$55,000](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-car-price-cost-analysts),\nwith 200,000 units expected to  \n  \nship in the first year.\n\nIn spite of mounting evidence however, Apple is still publicly silent\nregarding its oft-rumoured move into the electric vehicles space.\n\nIt’s expected that if Apple does release an electric vehicle, it won’t arrive\nuntil at least 2020.\n\nDo you think Apple is poaching employees too aggressively?
