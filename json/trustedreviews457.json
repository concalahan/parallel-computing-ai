If you’re goingto be watching a lot of Netflix on the go, the Super AMOLED, pixel packed,large screen should be just what you need.**If you want a pure Android experience, the Pixel is the best bet.** As it’sa Google phone, the Pixel comes with a standard, untouched version of Android,which for many, will be a big deal. Samsung’s skin isn’t bad – far from it –but if you like your Android Nougat pure, the Pixel is the way to go.**Consider the alternatives before purchasing either phone.** The [LGG6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/lg-g6-review) launched earlier this yearand comes with a similarly enlarged display to the new Galaxy phones, alongwith no home button.

It’s alsowaterproof and comes with a microSD card slot – both of which are lacking fromGoogle’s handset.**Specs:** While the Galaxy S8 is no doubt more powerful than the Pixel, inpractice, you probably won’t notice much different. Both phones have greatinternals that will provide a smooth user experience.
