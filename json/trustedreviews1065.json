Now however,\nQualcomm is finally updating its top-of-the-line wearable processor, and it\nlooks like battery life is the biggest winner.**\n\nQualcomm has achieved these gains with the Wear 3100 (which replaces the\nancient 2016-era Wear 2100) by rethinking how it approaches the SoC’s central\nprocessor.\n\nThe thinking, according to Qualcomm, is that most of the time when you’re\nlooking at your smartwatch you’re looking for very simple pieces of\ninformation such as a notification or just to see the time.\n\nFor these instances, it doesn’t make sense to have a beefy mobile processor\nchugging along when so little power is needed. Instead, Qualcomm has equipped\nthe chip with a ultra-low power co-processor, which keeps the watch running\nmost of the time.\n\nWhen you actually start using the watch properly to respond to messages or\nopen apps, then the chip will start to spin up the main processor to offer\nfull-fat smartwatch experience.\n\nThis main processor appears to be unchanged from the Wear 2100, implying that\nthere’ll be limited speed improvements with this version of the SoC.\n\nSo battery life is expected to be the biggest beneficiary of this change, with\nQualcomm predicting improvements of anywhere between 4 and 12 hours over the\nbattery life of Wear 2100 devices, and that’s before you even get into the\ndifferent modes the processor can run in.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n**Related:[Best smartwatches 2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nsmartwatch-3434307)**\n\n## A mode for every occasion\n\nThe thinking here is that different manufacturers will be making smartwatches\nto serve radically different use cases.\n\nAs such, Qualcomm is offering what it calls ‘personalised experiences’ or\ndifferent modes of operation for the chip with different strengths and\nweaknesses.\n\nRun the chip in ‘Traditional Watch Mode’ for example, and you’ll cut out all\nits extraneous features and end up with a device that can still tell you the\ntime for a week, even if it starts with just 20% of battery life.\n\nMeanwhile, ‘Dedicated Sports Experiences’ will prioritise those processes that\nare essential for activity tracking such as heart-rate monitoring and GPS,\nwhile otherwise maximising battery life to a respectable 15 hours — enough for\nall but the most dedicated of ultra-marathon enthusiasts.\n\nFinally, if you want to run a smartwatch with all its bells and whistles\nturned on then you can use a mode like ‘Ambient Mode’ which will enable\ninefficient-yet-pretty effects like a smooth second hand and live\n[complications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_\\(horology\\)).\n\nWith a complicated chip like this, there’ll be a lot of scope for different\nmanufacturers to use it in different ways. Some may let users customise which\nmode they want the watch to operate in, while others may hide it away behind\nautomatic battery saving modes to simplify the user experience.\n\nThe big question is when we’ll start to see watches running this new SoC, and\nwhile Qualcomm says its currently in mass production and shipping today,\nthere’s no telling when it might actually make its way into smartwatches that\npeople can buy.\n\nBut with Fossil Grou , Louis Vuitton and Montblanc already signed up as\nhardware partners, it’s likely that we’ll start to see Wear 3100 watches\nmaking their way to us before the end of the year.\n\n**What’s your big problem with modern smartwatches?
