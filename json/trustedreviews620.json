It’s in the limelight\nat the moment since support has just been added to the [Apple\nWatch](https://www.trustedreviews.com/apple-watch-2-review) via [watchOS\n4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-watchos-4-new-features-release-\ndate-download). Other fitness wearables such as the [Moov\nHR](https://www.trustedreviews.com/moov-hr-review) are also based around this\ntraining principle and it’s supported by many running watches, too.\n\nSo what exactly is HIIT, and what can it do for you? As is implied by its\nname, HIIT training is all about intensity. Where your 5km or 10km casual jog\nis generally carried out at a steady pace, often for a longer duration, HIIT\nincorporates intervals of all-out, explosive intensity, followed by a recovery\nperiod.\n\nYou then repeat the process for a set number of cycles, which can see your\nworkout complete in as few as 10 minutes. If you’re looking for the best bang\nfor your buck, or you’re seriously time-constrained, then HIIT could be the\nanswer.\n\n![watchOS\n4](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\n## HIIT workouts\n\nThe most basic HIIT training incorporates sprint-based work. This could mean\nall-out sprinting for 30 seconds, followed by 60-90 seconds of recovery.\nYou’ll then repeat this for a few rounds. Although this may not sound\nparticularly taxing, you’ll be drenched in sweat and gasping for breath if\nyou’re working out at the right intensity.\n\nThe principles of HIIT can also be applied to workouts aside from running. If\nyou’re a fan of resistance training, for example, you can use HIIT in your\nprogramme to include periods of high intensity, where you attempt to knock out\nas many reps as possible (AMRAP for you Crossfit aficionados), followed by\nanother exercise for your recovery period (supersetting).\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n**Related:[What is VO2 Max?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/what-is-\nvo2-max)**  \n![HIIT](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nHIIT is versatile enough technique to apply to anything from box jumps to jump\nrope or working a punch bag even. As long as you’re pushing your\ncardiovascular system hard enough during the intense bursts, you’ll be sure to\ngain the benefits of HIIT. Many spin classes are based around HIIT principles,\ntoo, and you can also go all-out on the rowing machine for set periods.\n\n## HIIT benefits\n\nSo what are the advantages of HIIT? One of the benefits, as mentioned above,\nis the ability to perform shorter workouts, which works out well for those\nwith time constraints. But one of the biggest checkboxes is that HIIT is said\nto be better for fat burning compared to more steady-state workouts. This is\nalongside avoiding potential muscle catabolism (the breakdown of muscle\ntissue), which can occur during long stints of aerobic exercise such as long-\ndistance running. After all, for effective weight loss you want to be losing\nfat, not lean muscle.\n\nThis fat-burning benefit can be the result of a number of reasons, but the\nbiggest is from excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC), also known as\nthe ‘afterburn effect’. A study into the technique found that participants’\nreduction in subcutaneous fat was higher for those who used HIIT, even though\nthe number of calories burned during actual exercise was low.\n\nThe notion is that your body will continue to burn calories for as long as 24\nhours after you finish your workout, due to an increased metabolic rate\nfollowing HIIT. This is because your body has a higher rate of oxygen intake\npost-workout to compensate for your body’s deficit due to all of that heavy\nbreathing during those intense intervals, and processing that oxygen requires\nenergy in the form of calories.  \n**  \nRelated:[Best running watches](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-running-\nwatches_round-up)**  \n![HIIT](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAnd really, that’s the main con to HIIT. Those heart-bustingly intense\nintervals push you to your limits. When I incorporate HIIT into my running, I\ndescribe the intensity as comparative to running for your life from an axe-\nwielding murderer. As such, HIIT can make you feel a little sick and can be\njust as mentally taxing as it is physically. Needless to say, HIIT isn’t\nalways the most _fun_.\n\nYou don’t necessarily have to push yourself quite as hard as that, but you\ncertainly shouldn’t be taking it easy. The other downside to HIIT is that it’s\nunlikely to work your cardiovascular endurance system as hard, so any distance\nor marathon runners might not necessarily benefit in that regard. But if\nyou’re involved in sports such as soccer or basketball, the stop-start\nsprinting element more closely emulates the physical taxation of a game.\n\nNevertheless, you can always incorporate HIIT alongside steady-state cardio to\nget the best of both worlds; it’s definitely worth giving it a go. **  \n**  \n**Related:[Best heart rate monitors](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-\nheart-rate-monitor_round-up)**  \n![Moov HR](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Using wearables for HIIT\n\nAs mentioned, many wearables now incorporate some form of support for HIIT\nworkouts. This could be anything as simple as a timer to let you know when to\ntransition between intense or recovery periods, or a heart rate sensor to\nensure you’re pushing yourself hard enough to stay in the correct heart rate\nzone. The Moov HR, for example, takes you through pre-determined bodyweight\nexercise circuits while monitoring your heart rate.\n\nOne issue is that not all heart rate monitors can cope with the rapid changes\nin heart rate, which is something we often cite when reviewing fitness\ntrackers and wearables. Ultimately, it isn’t absolutely necessary to have a\nfancy piece of tech to take advantage of HIIT, but the extra metrics can be\nuseful.  \n**  \nDo you use HIIT as part of your workouts?
