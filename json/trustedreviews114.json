The iPhone 8 Plus is the biggest, with a 5.5-inch display,\nso it’s great if you’re a fan of larger phones. These are great for watching\nfilms on, for example. Otherwise, all three phones share the same A11 Bionic\nchip, which brings with it plenty of performance for your apps and games.\n\nThe iPhone 8 Plus differentiates itself from the iPhone 8 thanks to dual\ncameras on the back, which is used for some fancy effects like studio\nlighting, which isn’t available on the smaller model. The 5.5-inch display has\na 1080p resolution and supports Apple’s True Tone technology. This helps match\nthe display’s colour temperature to your environment, making it look much\nbetter. The iPhone 8 Plus also manages to pack in a bigger battery to its\nsmaller sibling, too.\n\n* * *\n\n### iPhone 8 Plus not the phone for you?\n\n**Consider these:**\n\n  * **Related:**[Best iPhone 7 deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-iphone-7-deals-2993225)\n  * **Related:** [Best iPhone 8 deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-iphone-8-deals-3260322)\n  * **Related:** [Best iPhone X deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-iphone-x-deals-3289493)\n  * **Related:** [Best Samsung Galaxy S9 deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s9-deals-3402357)\n  * **Related:** [Best Samsung Galaxy S8 deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-samsung-galaxy-s8-deals-2993182)\n  * **Related:** Best SIM only deals\n\n* * *\n\n## How to pick the right iPhone 8 Plus deal for you\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\niPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus\n\n### Work out how much data you need\n\nFor most smartphone users today, it’s all about data. Your data allowance\naffects how much you’re able to stream, browse the web, message using apps\nlike WhatsApp or make video calls (while away from trusty Wi-Fi), basically\nall of the good stuff.\n\nData allowance is therefore the main thing that separates most contracts,\nbecause the age where minutes and texts were most important are long gone.\nMost contracts will just give you an unlimited amount of minutes and texts.\n\nIf you’re only a light data user, you can get away with 4-8GB a month, which\nwill still let you stream music and watch occasional Netflix over 4G. If\nyou’re a heavy streamer or want to tether your mobile connection to another\ndevice, you’ll want at least 10GB of data a month. Many of the deals available\ntoday are actually cheaper for the data heavier options. You can never have\ntoo much data, after all.\n\n### Decide what you can afford to pay upfront\n\nTypically, the more you’re willing to spend upfront, the lower your monthly\ncost will be. Spending more upfront can also reduce the amount you pay over\nthe course of your contract, which is typically 24 months.\n\nThis is called your total cost of ownership (TCO), which is your monthly cost\nx the term of your contract + any upfront cost.\n\nIf you don’t have the money to splash out at the beginning, look for a\ncontract with a low upfront cost, some contracts will even completely forego\nany upfront cost, which is handy and can open up the door to grabbing your\nfavourite new smartphone while spreading the cost.\n\n### How to choose the right mobile network\n\nYou might be happy with the service and benefits of your current network, but\nwe think it’s always worth shopping around to see what kind of benefits other\nnetworks are bundling into their mobile phone contracts.\n\nThe main providers are offering some incredibly tempting extras and flexible\ncontract options at the moment. It’s worth comparing these as they can add a\nlot of extra value to your contract. Take EE, for instance; it offers free\nApple Music for six months on certain contracts. This is worth £60 usually.\n\nWe’ve summarised the different offers from each network below to help you\nsettle on the best option for you.\n\n### **Three**\n\nRenowned for piling on loads more data for your money than other networks,\nThree is a good option if you like take your internet in supersized doses. The\nbiggest boon with Three at the moment is its Go Binge service, which gives you\nunlimited streaming time on apps like Netflix, Apple Music and TVPlayer (you\ncan see the full list of services[ here](http://www.three.co.uk/go-binge))\nwithout eating into your own precious data allowance.\n\nThe network now offers ‘Feel at Home’ roaming in 71 countries, which lets you\nuse your data allowance while you’re abroad.\n\n### **EE**\n\nPopular for its affordable deals on flagship phones, EE claims to boast the\nbiggest 4G coverage in the UK, as well as offering a three-month subscription\nto BT Sport on your mobile when you sign up, plus six months of free Apple\nMusic for pay monthly subscribers.\n\n### **Vodafone**\n\nYou can get 24 months of Spotify Premium, Sky Sports Mobile or Now TV with\ncertain Vodafone Red Entertainment plans. That’s certainly not a freebie to be\nsniffed at since some of these services are pretty costly when bought\nseparately.\n\nRecently, Vodafone also announced it was bolstering its roaming options for\nits Red Entertainment plans. This means you can now use your phone abroad with\nno additional charge in an expanded 77 countries, which now includes the\nUnited States. That’s great for any frequent flyers looking to avoid any\nsurprise bills.\n\n### **O2**\n\nFancy getting first dibs on gig tickets 48 hours before the rest of the\ngeneral population? That’s the special treatment you get with O2’s Priority\nTickets service when you sign up for a mobile contract.\n\nYou also get free access to certain public Wi-Fi networks across the UK, plus\nO2 now supports roaming in 75 countries.\n\nThe network also offers Flexible Tariffs that you can customise each month\naccording to your needs, along with an attractive O2 Refresh service that\nreduces your bill when you’ve paid off the price of the phone.\n\n### **iD**\n\nThis budget busting network comes courtesy of Carphone Warehouse, who knows by\nnow how to keep its mobile customers happy. One of iD’s great features is Data\nRollover, which does what it says on the tin. At the end of the month, any\nunused data from your allowance gets carried over into the next.\n\n### Check mobile coverage\n\nOne last thing – make sure you check the coverage in your area before you sign\nup with a new network to avoid getting stuck in a dead spot. Here are the\nlinks for the main networks’ coverage checkers:\n\n  * [O2 network coverage checker](https://www.o2.co.uk/coveragechecker)\n  * [Vodafone network coverage checker](https://www.vodafone.co.uk/explore/network/uk-coverage-map/index.htm)\n  * [EE network coverage checker](https://ee.co.uk/why-ee/mobile-coverage)\n  * [Three network coverage checker](http://www.three.co.uk/Discover/Network/Coverage)\n  * [iD network coverage checker](https://www.idmobile.co.uk/help-and-advice/uk-coverage-checker)\n\n### Wi-Fi calling\n\nFor when you simply can’t get any network reception, there’s also Wi-Fi\ncalling. This lets you use a Wi-Fi internet connection to make and receive\ncalls and texts, bypassing the need for any network reception. Your calls and\nmessages simply come out of your tariff’s allowance as normal.\n\nTo turn this on, simply go to Settings > Phone > Wi-Fi Calling on your iPhone\n8 Plus and toggle the setting to on.\n\n**Are you picking up a bargain iPhone 8 Plus?
