The PS4 Pro represents a\nmeatier, more powerful unit that delivers better performance capable of\n[4K](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/4k-tv-10-reasons-why-you-should-\ncare) gaming and [HDR](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/hdr-tv-high-\ndynamic-television-explained).\n\nIt’s other new console became known as the PS4 Slim, which offers the same\nfunctionality as the launch model in a sleeker form factor. Sony calls this\nthe ‘PS4’ as it’s phased out the original console.\n\nThat’s the basics, but in our PS4 Pro vs PS4 guide will explain the details in\nsimple terms – and complicated ones for those who like numbers – and answer\ncommon questions, including:\n\n  * How powerful is the PS4 Pro?\n  * How do the graphics compare?\n  * What is HDR and should I care?\n  * Do you need a 4K HDR TV?\n  * Is the PS4 Pro better for PlayStation VR?\n\nAnd if you just want the short version of this article, scroll to the end for\nthe definitive verdict on the PS4 Pro vs PS4 debate.\n\n**Related:[Xbox One X vs PS4 Pro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/xbox-\none-x-vs-ps4-pro-2993235)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Google Home Hub YouTube](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n###  Will Google Home Hub ever get Netflix?

We’ll get onto how that power is\nused a little later.\n\n### Best PS4 Deals\n\n[](https://amzn.to/2CgaurC)\n\n[](https://amzn.to/2CgaurC)\n\n###\n\n[Sony PlayStation 4 1TB Console - Black\n\n](https://amzn.to/2CgaurC)\n\nThe compact, efficient Sony PS4 Slim in all its glory with plenty of storage.\nYou can save more by buying a bundle deal right now, however.\n\n[Amazon\n\n](https://amzn.to/2CgaurC)\n\n|\n\nNow £279.55\n\n[View Deal](https://amzn.to/2CgaurC)\n\nNow £279.55\n\n|\n\n[Amazon\n\n](https://amzn.to/2CgaurC)\n\nIn addition, while the PS4 Pro has the same amount of memory as the original\nPS4 – 8GB GDDR5 – it runs at a higher speed to improve performance. The PS4\nPro also has an extra 1GB of memory for non-gaming applications like Netflix.\nThis means they won’t waste space games can use and means you can switch\nbetween apps faster.  \n**  \nHere are the PS4 Pro specs compared to the original and PS4 ‘Slim’ versions:**\n\n|  PS4 (2013) | PS4 (2016) | PS4 Pro  \n---|---|---|---  \n**CPU** |  1.6GHz 8-core AMD Jaguar | 1.6GHz 8-core AMD Jaguar | 2.1GHz 8-core\nAMD Jaguar  \n**GPU** |  1.84 TFLOP AMD Radeon | 1.84 TFLOP AMD Radeon | 4.2 TFLOP AMD\nRadeon  \n**Memory** |  8GB GDDR5 | 8GB GDDR5 | 8GB GDDR5 & 1GB  \n**HDR  \n** |  Yes | Yes | Yes  \n**4K  \n** |  No | No | Yes  \n**Storage** |  500GB | 500GB & 1TB | 1TB  \n**USB** |  2x USB 3.0 | 2x USB 3.1 | 3x USB 3.1  \n**Wi-Fi** |  802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi (2.4GHz only) | 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi (2.4GHz\n& 5.0GHz) | 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi (2.4GHz & 5.0GHz)  \n**Bluetooth** |  Bluetooth 2.1 | Bluetooth 4.0 | Bluetooh 4.0  \n  \n## PS4 Pro vs PS4 Graphics Comparison\n\nIt depends on the game. Developers can use the extra power for anything they\nwant within reason. Most will increase the resolution – the number of pixels\nthat make the picture – of their games, so they appear sharper on 4K TVs, but\nthat’s not all.\n\nDevelopers can also use the more powerful PS4 Pro GPU to improve the quality\nof textures and lighting effects, leading to more realistic graphics and\nsmoother performance with fewer slowdowns. The only demand Sony makes is games\nmust play as well on the PS4 Pro as they do on the PS4, and vice versa.\n\n**Buy Now:[Ps4 Pro at Tesco from\n£349](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16GJ3oPHGQdejKQgo2I8SCLr-2rpiLFPSf4-sS5O0Ds8/edit#gid=0)**\n\nBut beware watching YouTube videos that compare the two. Unless you’re viewing\nvideos in 4K on a 4K TV, it’s really hard to tell the difference. In this\ncase, still images are often the best comparison. Look closely at the examples\nbelow:\n\n**Related:[PS5 latest news and\nrumours](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/playstation-5-ps5-price-release-\ndate-games-news-rumours)**  \n![PS4 Pro](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg) Here’s a shot of a demo running on the PS4.\n\n![PS4 Pro\n3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)And now the same demo running on the PS4 Pro.\n\nThe most obvious difference is the lighting. The ‘god rays’ give the scene a\nnew dynamism, lighting up the rocks and enhancing the contrast in the scene.\n\nAnother benefit is the foliage. There’s copious extra greenery, such as extra\nplants, grass and vines. The PS4 version has simpler, flatter textures that\nadd little.\n\nThe PS4 Pro isn’t just about making things look sharper. More power allows\ndevelopers to render more items in the game, which helps create worlds that\nare packed with more interesting details to enjoy.\n\n## But I heard the PS4 Pro doesn’t actually run games at native 4K…\n\nWell, this is technically true. Some games will run at a native 4K Ultra HD\nresolution – that’s 3,840 by 2,160 lines pixels by the way – but the most\ndemanding games won’t.\n\nWhy? Because it’s very hard to render games smoothly at such a high\nresolution, even with the additional power of the PS4 Pro. A gaming PC that\ncan run games at 4K would cost several times more than the PS4 Pro, after all.\n\nInstead, many games will run at a resolution close to 4K – often but not\nalways 3,200 by 1,800 lines – and then be upscaled to 4K. Sony has employed a\nclever technique that improves this process, so much so that’s it’s very hard\nto tell the difference between its upscaled visuals and native 4K ones. There\nis a difference, but it’s hard to spot.\n\nAnd this practice is nothing new. Many games already run below 1080p on\nexisting consoles and are upscaled to it. And while the Xbox One S can upscale\n1080p games up to 4K, there’s no serious comparison between the two consoles.\n\nThe closer to 4K you get the better the upscaling will appear, so the [Xbox\nOne S](https://www.trustedreviews.com/xbox-one-s-review) can’t match a PS4 Pro\nrunning the same game.\n\n## What is HDR and what difference does it make?\n\nHDR, which is short for High Dynamic Range, is about making films, TV and\ngames appear brighter, more colourful and closer to real life.\n\nFor years TVs have been hamstrung by decades old standards designed for CRT\nTVs and cinema screens. HDR defines a new standard that allows TVs to exploit\ntheir full potential.\n\nWhat this means in practice is higher peak brightness and brighter, more\nvibrant colours throughout, leading to a more realistic and immersive picture.\n\nAgain, it’s hard to appreciate this unless you already have an HDR TV, but\nthis example from The Last of Us: Remastered gives you a good idea of the\ndifference.\n\n**Related:[Best PS4\nGames](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/ps4-games-3431751)**  \n![PS4 Pro\n2](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg) This is a shot of the game running on a normal PS4.\n\n![PS4 Pro\n1](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)And this is same game running on the PS4 Pro. HDR support\ntransforms the mushy white sky into a deeply detailed and textured sky.\n\nOn the opposite extreme, imagine a shot of the sun in a game. On a non-HDR TV,\nit would look unremarkable. On a good HDR TV, it would feel more like staring\nat a bright light – not as bright as staring at the real sun, obviously, but\nbright enough to dazzle you.\n\n**Related:[Upcoming PS4 Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/upcoming-\nps4-games)**\n\n## Do you need a 4K HDR TV to use the PS4 Pro?\n\nNo, but we do recommend you have one. Some games use a method called\nSupersampling to improve the graphics for players on 1080p TVs, but not all\ngames will. Right now, I don’t I think it’s worth upgrading from your existing\nPS4 if you don’t own a 4K TV.\n\n[PS4 update 4.50](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ps4-update-to-introduce-\nexternal-hdd-support-custom-wallpapers-and-more) will also introduce a new\nfeature known as “Boost Mode” that can dramatically increase performance of\nsome games. It won’t enhance then to 4K, but it will provide you with a\nnoticeable improvement in frame rate of up to 40 percent. Finally, those\nwithout a 4K TV have reason to invest in PS4 Pro.\n\n## Is the PS4 Pro better for PlayStation VR?\n\nNot conclusively. Games won’t be any smoother in VR on the PS4 Pro compared to\nthe PS4. And while a few add visual upgrades, there aren’t enough examples to\njustify the extra expense. The difference could become more significant in\nfuture, however.\n\nIt’s worth noting the [PlayStation\nVR](https://www.trustedreviews.com/playstation-vr-review) has a compatibility\nissue with the PS4 Pro, too. The PlayStation VR uses a version of HDMI\nincompatible with 4K and HDR, so PS4 Pro users have to unplug the VR system to\nplay games on their TV as intended. Although, a new and upcoming model is set\nto address the aforementioned issue.\n\n**Related:[Xbox One S vs PS4\nPro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/ps4-pro-vs-xbox-one-s-2940191)**\n\n## How much larger is the PS4 Pro compared to the PS4?\n\nQuite a bit, which is worth considering if space is an issue, though the PS4\nPro’s still smaller than the notoriously huge original Xbox One.  \n**  \nPS4 Pro vs PS4 Size Comparison** **(WxDxH):**\n\n  * New PS4 Slim: 26.5 x 28.8 x 3.9cm\n  * Original PS4: 27.5 x 30.5 x 5.3cm\n  * PS4 Pro: 29.5 x 32.7 x 5.5cm\n\nSo the PS4 Pro is a good three centimetres wider, four centimetres deeper and\nclose to two centimetres taller. That doesn’t sound like much written down,\nbut the PS4 Pro is actually 78% larger in volume than the PS4 ‘Slim’ model –\nit’s 20% larger than the launch console.\n\n**Buy Now:[ PS4 Slim with Fifa 18 at Tesco from\n£249](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7090&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-\ntescocampaign&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tesco.com%2Fdirect%2Fplaystation-4-slim-500gb-\nfifa-18-console%2F680-4475.prd%3FskuId%3D680-4475)**\n\n![Sony PS4 Pro\n11](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n\n## PS4 Pro vs PS4 – Games\n\nThere’s no such thing as a ‘PS4 Pro Exclusive’ game. Games must be enhanced\nfor PS4 Pro, but Sony won’t allow any game to only run on PS4 Pro.\n\nAll PS4 games must now support a PS4 Pro mode with improved graphics and\nperformance, but some games do this better than others.\n\n**[Horizon Zero Dawn](https://www.trustedreviews.com/horizon-zero-dawn-\nreview)** : This is the first PS4 exclusive designed specifically with the PS4\nPro in mind. It looks stunning, so it’s must-have for any PS4 Pro owner.\n\n**[Resident Evil 7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/resident-evil-7-review):**\nAn excellent game that really benefits from HDR, adding to the already creepy\nfeeling throughout the game.\n\n**[Rise of the Tomb Raider](https://www.trustedreviews.com/rise-of-the-tomb-\nraider-review): ** One of the best examples of PS4 Pro upgrades. While it\ndoesn’t support HDR, visual improvements in both ‘4K’ and 1080p make this is a\nvisual treat.\n\n**[The Last Guardian](https://www.trustedreviews.com/the-last-guardian-\nreview):** Supports both 4K and 1080p high performance modes on PS4 Pro and\nthe HDR. HDR works on the existing PS4 as well, however.\n\n**[The Last of Us Remastered](https://www.trustedreviews.com/the-last-of-us-\nremastered-review):** Probably the best game for HDR in the PS4 Pro line-up,\nit supports native 4K at 60fps and looks great.\n\n**[Hitman](https://www.trustedreviews.com/hitman-review):** No HDR support,\nbut both performance and textures are improved on PS4 Pro.\n\n**[Battlefield 1](https://www.trustedreviews.com/battlefield-1-review):** One\nof the best PS4 Pro upgrades around.

While the Xbox One S supports [Ultra HD Blu-\nray](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/what-is-ultra-hd-blu-ray), the\nPS4 Pro doesn’t and won’t in future. It does support 4K HDR content from the\nlikes of Netflix, however.\n\nIf you do want to play Ultra HD Blu-rays, read our guide to the best Blu-ray\nplayers, or buy an Xbox One S.\n\n## PS4 Pro vs PS4: Conclusion\n\n**Don’t upgrade if you own a PS4 and have a 1080p TV.** Until you decide to\nupgrade to a 4K TV, I see no sense in spending more to buy a PS4 Pro. The cost\noutweighs the benefits. It’s worth upgrading if you’re buying a new 4K TV, but\nif you can’t afford both then buy the TV first. Our [best 4K TV\nguide](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-4k-tvs_round-up) is a good place to\nstart.\n\n**Seriously consider upgrading if you own already a 4K TV.** I can’t outright\nrecommend you buy a PS4 Pro, but there are plenty of compelling reasons to do\nso. Games look great on a 4K TV on a PS4 Pro and upcoming releases like Mass\nEffect: Andromeda and Horizon: Zero Dawn are showing great promise. Only\nreconsider if you want but don’t already own an Ultra HD Blu-ray player, or if\nyou own a budget 4K TV that lacks HDR support. Head to [best Blu-ray\nplayers](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-blu-ray-players_round-up) for our\ntop picks.\n\n**Buy a PS4 Pro if you don’t own a PS4 already.** Provided you can afford it,\nof course. Even if you don’t own a 4K TV, a PS4 Pro will give you faster and\nbetter looking games and is future proof should you upgrade your TV in future.\nAnd if you can’t afford a PS4 Pro, the existing PS4 will play all the same\ngames and remains a great console.
