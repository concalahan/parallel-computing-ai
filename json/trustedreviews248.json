The Google\nAssistant is also coming to automobiles via Android Auto, as well as direct\nintegration through car manufacturers such as Kia.\n\nThe firm also previewed a host of touchscreen Assistant devices that have\n…erm… echoes of the Amazon Echo Show. Those units will be produced by the\nlikes of JBL, Lenovo, LG and Sony,and you can see the preview in the video\nbelow.\n\nLike the Show, users of the Google-based touchscreen devices will display\nvideos, enable video calls, showcase calendars and visualise information from\nthe web.\n\nOne such device is the JBL Link View (pictured), which has an 8-inch display\nflanked by a pair of 10W speakers. It has a 5-megapixel camera, Wi-Fi,\nBluetooth, built-in Chromecast and IPX4 splash protection.\n\n**Related:[CES 2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ces-2018-live-news-\nhighlights-3350586)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nAnother is the Lenovo Smart Display (below), which will arrive this summer for\nunder $200. That has a single speaker and the choice of 8- or 10-inch\ndisplays. Of course, you’ll be able to see the weather, calendar, and\ninteractive directions from Google Maps.\n\nThe Smart Display can operate in both portrait and landscape configurations.\nThere’s the Qualcomm Snapdragon 624 processor, 2GB of RAM and 4GB storage to\nboot. The 10-inch version even has a Full HD display, as well as a sweet\nbamboo finish.\n\n![Lenovo Smart\nDisplay](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## New Home alternatives\n\nIn terms of smart speakers, Altec Lansing, Anker, Bang & Olufsen, Braven,\niHome, JBL, Jensen, LG, Klipsch, Knit Audio, Memorex, Riva Audio and SōLIS are\nall building audio accessories with the Assistant at their heart.\n\nAs for headphones, the existing offerings will be supplemented by products\nfrom Jaybird, JBL, LG and Sony.\n\nPerhaps the coolest Assistant news of all is the forthcoming integration\nwithin Android Auto.\n\nDrivers with compatible vehicles will have faster access to common\nfunctionality through the new Actions feature. That means directions via\nGoogle Maps, music and much more will be available through voice commands.\n\nThe company is also working with a range of auto manufacturers to build the\nGoogle Assistant directly into the infotainment system.\n\nKia is among the car makers jumping on board from the get-go. Assistant will\nbe part of a host of some 2018 models, such as the K900, Optima, Soul EV\nconfigurations. Panasonic is also adding the Google Assistant to the\ninfotainment systems it builds for automotive partners.\n\n**Can Google Assistant enjoy as much success as Alexa achieved in 2017?
