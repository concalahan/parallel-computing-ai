Now, the third\ninstalment is on the way in the form of Metro Exodus.**\n\nTaking the series open-world, Exodus is already shaping up to be something\nspecial.\n\n_TrustedReviews_ has compiled everything you need to know about Metro Exodus\nincluding all the latest news, release date info, trailers and more.\n\n## Metro Exodus Preview\n\n**Coming to PS4, Xbox One and PC on February 22, 2019.**\n\n4A Games’ Metro franchise has remained a beloved cult hit since its inception\nin 2010. Its focus on the stark atmosphere and unstoppable dread of a nuclear\napocalypse helped it stand out from the miserable puddle of grey shooters to\nemerge in the past decade. Two entries later and the trilogy is closing with a\ntruly ambitious vision that doesn’t quite take Metro open world, but gets\npretty damn close.\n\nThe freezing wilds of Russia in the midst of nuclear winter remain a\ncompelling place to explore, and 4A Games hasn’t sacrificed any of the detail\nthat makes its world feel genuinely lived in. It’s absurdly miserable, but\nbeautifully crafted in a way that’s impossible not to admire.\n\n**Related:**[ **E3\n2018**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/e3-2018-2949170)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n![metro\nexodus](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nMetro Exodus chronicles a journey across Russia as Artyom, our protagonist,\nseeks to escort his friends and loved ones to a place of salvation. This is\ndone aboard a colossal train that must contend with numerous threats. The\nstart of my 2 hour demo begins with the train being ambushed by a group of\nbandits, leaving the engine in tatters as you’re sent out to perform repairs.\n\nThis begins the season of Spring, one of four periods the tale of Metro Exodus\nwill be split into. Presumably: Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter will each be\nlengthy chapters with equally massive areas to sink into. This way, 4A Games\ncan maintain the handcrafted feeling of past titles without succumbing to the\nusual open-world guff you’d expect from the genre.\n\nJudging by terrifying mixture of shrapnel-addled fields and radioactive lakes,\nthis balance is managed beautifully. Upon receiving my objective I was given\nfree reign to explore. I could ignore the task at hand at my own risk or do as\nI’m told like a good person. I did the latter, and quickly stumbled upon a\nparanoid cult afraid of the technology that brought this nuclear armageddon\nupon us.\n\nConsidering I was packing an assortment of weapons and other fancy gizmos,\nthey weren’t too happy to see me. Following my arrival I was immediately\ntrapped, and offered a choice: take the easy way out and kill them all, or\nsneak out the backdoor without harming anyone, thus leaving my relationship\nwith this faction intact.\n\nMetro Exodus is wonderful when it comes to player choice, with subtle sound\ncues indicating how your actions influence the wider world. How far this\nmorality system permeates through the games narrative remains unknown, but\nthere’s plenty of potential here to discover who the real monster is in this\ncorrupt society.\n\n**Related:**[ **Battlefield\n5**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/battlefield-5-release-date-3231890)\n\n![metro\nexodus](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAt its core, this is the same formula 4A Games created in 2010 with Metro\n2033, albeit with huge refinements that make it feel like a modern marvel as\nit balances a number of systems with genuine weight behind them. Artyom\ncarries a multi-faceted backpack with him at all times, capable of storing\nplenty of items and acting as a makeshift crafting station.\n\nIt turns an atmospheric shooter into one with plenty of nuance. Areas require\nspecific items depending on the enemies and have a clear atmosphere that’s\nunique to them. A dilapidated tunnel ripe with radioactive fungi means it’s\ntime to don a gas mask and hope you aren’t jumped out of nowhere. Stumbling\nthrough cobweb-ridden corridors without a lighter means you’ll move slower,\nsomething you really don’t want happening in Exodus.\n\nBeing able to tear a highly advanced rifle down to nothing before thrusting a\nrange of your favourite attachments on it never gets old, and provides the\nalready challenging gunplay with an extra helping of strategy. Firearms feel\nheavy and deliberate, and running out of ammo in the face of radioactive\nbeasts is a common occurrence. You’ll need to improvise in Metro Exodus. Its\npost-apocalyptic hellscape possesses a palpable sense of realism as your\nfractured enclave struggles to survive.\n\nCombat is in need of some balancing ahead of launch, though. Unless you’re\npulling off flawless headshots, some foes take far too many bullets to defeat.\nIt feels like a test of endurance as all of your ammunition is wasted. In a\ngame where inventory management is so vital it feels like a needless\ndetriment. I was playing on the standard difficulty.\n\n**Related:**[ **Kingdom Hearts\n3**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/kingdom-hearts-3-release-\ndate-2993095)\n\n![metro\nexodus](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe world of Exodus is the real star here, presenting an unrivalled vision of\na ruined world in an industry filled with them. However, it’s also showcasing\na lot of potential when it comes to telling smaller, more personal stories as\nyou explore. One of the highlights saw me stumbling upon a mother and her\nyoung daughter. I helped them escape the ruined town they called home, before\nescorting them to The Aurora.\n\nHowever, my people weren’t willing to let them on-board. My good deed was for\nnothing, and I had to live with it or go out of my way to make a difference.\nIt’s still unclear whether situations like this are commonplace in Metro\nExodus, or if the player is free to tackle side activities designed to add\nextra weight to an already heavy world. Either way, there’s so much potential\nhere for something brilliant.\n\n## First Impressions\n\nExodus feels like the culmination of the studio’s ambition vision. It’s dark,\nbrooding and filled with enough grim atmosphere to ruin even the wildest of\nparties. A larger world allows the existing formula to be expanded in some\ntruly exciting ways, providing elements that gel naturally with everything\nfans of the series have come to love. While a handful of its parts still need\nrefining, Metro Exodus is shaping up to a stunning post-apocalyptic adventure\nset to conclude an equally fantastic narrative.\n\n## What is Metro Exodus?\n\nBased on Dmitry Glukhovsky’s popular novels, Metro Exodus is intended as the\nthird instalment in a series that started back in 2010 with Metro 2033.\nInstead of being restricted to dank subway tunnels and brief pockets of Moscow\nRuins, players will now have a much larger range of environments to explore.\n\n## Metro Exodus release date – When is it coming out?\n\n4A Games’ confirmed at [E3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/e3-2018-games-\nnews-trailers-announcements-2949170) that Metro Redux will be arriving on\n[PS4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/playstation-4-review), [Xbox\nOne](https://www.trustedreviews.com/xbox-one-review) and\n[PC](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/best-gaming-pc) in the first quarter\nof 2019. It’ll also be playable in 4K on [Xbox One\nX](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/xbox-one-x-preorder-specs-price-\nrelease-date).\n\n**Related:[Best Xbox One Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-xbox-\none-games-3435271)**\n\n![metro\nexodus](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Metro Exodus gameplay – How does it play?\n\nMetro Exodus is a first-person survival horror spanning across linear,\nclaustrophobic environments and wide-open spaces to explore, as shown by the\nrecent reveal trailer. While navigating the post-apocalyptic Russian\nFederation, players will have to keep themselves well-equipped and prepared\nfor a manner of radioactive horrors.\n\nJust like past games, a gas mask will have to be worn outside. Filters must be\nswapped to ensure you have a fresh air supply. If an enemy attacks you, cracks\nin your vision will remain as a bleak reminder of your potential fate. For\ndark environments, you have a torch and/or lighter on hand. These can be used\nto navigate obstacles and avoid potential dangers.\n\n**Related:[PS4 Pro vs Xbox One\nX](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/xbox-one-x-vs-ps4-pro)  \n**\n\n**![metro\nexodus](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \n**  \nIn terms of locations, Exodus is far more ambitious than its predecessors.\nPlaying once again as Artyom, you’ll join the Spartan Rangers as they venture\ntoward the Far East. Our hero will find himself travelling from Volga River to\nthe snowy Ural Mountains. With any luck, they’ll maintain the same sense of\ntension and dread we adore from Metro.\n\nExodus will feature a dynamic day/night cycle and weather system, set to take\nfull advantage of Microsoft’s Xbox One X. Weapons and items can be made using\na multi-tiered crafting system designed to help you survive. You’ll have to do\na bit of scavenging, though.\n\n## Metro Exodus story – What’s it about?\n\nSet during the year 2036 following Metro: Last Light’s ‘Redemption’ ending,\nExodus follows Artyom as he travels across Moscow in search of a new life. But\nhe isn’t alone, joined by his wife, Anna, and a number of fellow survivors.\nTheir journey will be treacherous, starting in the midst of a nuclear winter\nas you cower in the metro tunnels.\n\nA recent report by [Game\nInformer](http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2018/02/07/10-bold-\nchanges-exodus-is-making-to-\nmetro.aspx?utm_content=buffer9d8e5&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer)\nshed some light on how the world of Exodus will operate. The narrative begins\nin the Metro but will soon venture into the frozen wilds of post-apocalyptic\nRussia. It’s not open-world like Fallout 4, but instead a series of large\nsandboxes driven by exploration and linear missions. Once you leave an area,\nyou can’t return, so make sure to finish up side quests before moving on.\n\n## Metro Exodus trailer – How does it look?\n\nFirst showcased during Microsoft’s E3 2017 press conference, Metro Exodus\nreceived an impressive gameplay demonstration running on Xbox One X.
