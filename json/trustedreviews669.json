The\nbetter you do, the more powers you can gain, such as magnetism, speed boosts\nand night vision to help you uncover more spirits.\n\nThe team with the highest score at the end of the game wins. Teams are\nrandomised, but it is possible to create a link to challenge your friends.\nPlayers will also be able to share their achievements online afterwards.\n\nThe Great Ghoul Duel is a surprisingly fun way to kill a couple of minutes. In\nfact, that’s precisely why you’re not reading this story about ten minutes\nearlier. If you want to wave goodbye to half an hour, you can [play for\nyourself here](https://www.google.com/doodles/halloween-2018).\n\nGoogle’s Halloween guide also includes some pumpkin carving ideas via Google\nImages and some scary Google Assistant suggestions. Google Home owners will be\nable to ask for directions to their nearest pumpkin patch, for costume ideas,\nor for facts about monsters. Users will be also be able to ask “OK,\nGoogle…What does a werewolf sound like?”\n\nIn its [blog post](https://www.blog.google/products/maps/celebrate-halloween-\nghoul-gle/), Google is encouraging folks to visit some spooky Street View\nimagery in various US cities.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Google Halloween Doodle 18](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Google’s 2018 Halloween Doodle is an addictive multiplayer game – here’s\nhow to play\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-halloween-doodle-2018-game-\nplay-3613241 \"Google’s 2018 Halloween Doodle is an addictive multiplayer game\n– here’s how to play\")\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Google’s Gboard keyboard now creates emoji that look just like you\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-emoji-minis-gboard-3613215\n\"Google’s Gboard keyboard now creates emoji that look just like you\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Apple Watch Series 4](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Apple watchOS 5.1 arrives alongside iOS 12.1, but major feature still\nmissing\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/watchos-5-1-features-3613211 \"Apple\nwatchOS 5.1 arrives alongside iOS 12.1, but major feature still missing\")\n\n  * \n\n**Have you taken the Halloween Doodle for a spin yet?
