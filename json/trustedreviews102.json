Sure, you getsome hefty specs for that, including 4GB of RAM, a 5.7-inch QuadHD display,and a minimum of 64GB of on-board storage but still. DAMN, Samsung.Is it worth it though?Reflecting on the steep asking price, _TrustedReviews Mobile Editor_ said:“We’ve come to expect high pricing at the premium end of the mobile market,but still…When the Note 4 launched it carried a less jaw-dropping £629 pricetag, and with the iPhone 6S Plus available from £699, this really is a leap offaith from Samsung. It has a devoted fanbase that will no doubt covet the newNote 7, but it may well have priced potential adoptees out.“Then again, Samsung offers competitive devices at pretty much every pricepoint, so it knows exactly where it wants to pitch its flagship phablet. Ithas a reputation as a ballsy company and, based on today’s launch, has nointention of softening its aggressive approach.”**Related:[Galaxy Note 7 hands-on](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-note-7-review)**Watch: Galaxy Note 7 vs Note 5Will you be coughing up for a Galaxy Note 7 pre-order?
