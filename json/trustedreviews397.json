Your complete\nguide to the latest Pokémon Go update and all the Pokémon Go news you need is\nright here.**\n\nPokémon Go has been officially released for a couple of years now, but Niantic\nhasn’t taken much of a break.\n\nInstead the developer has been hard at work adding extra features to the game.\nWe’ve already seen the arrival of the series 2nd and 3rd generations of\nPokémon and select legendary creatures, but there’s still a lot more to come.\n\nAt the top of our wish list is having the ability to finally trade Pokémon\nwith other players. Niantic has been promising this feature since the game\nfirst launched two years ago, but it’s still yet to arrive — presumably\nbecause it’s a feature with such a high potential to completely ruin the\ndifficulty of the game.\n\n**Related:[Pokémon Go special research\nquests](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/pokemon-go-special-research-quest-\nwalkthrough-catch-mew-3450157)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Pokémon Go News: Trading and Player Battles\n\nWe know that trading and player battles are coming, given that the company has\nbeen talking about the features as recently as September last year when\nPokemon company boss Tsunekazu Ishihara confirmed that trading and player-vs-\nplayer battles are in development for the popular mobile title.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nSpeaking to\n[Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-05/pokemon-s-ceo-\nhints-at-big-plans-for-games-on-smartphone-switch), Ishihara said “we’ve only\nachieved 10 percent of what Pokemon and Niantic are trying to do,” hinting at\nfuture updates to come. “Going forward we will have to include fundamental\nPokémon experiences such as Pokémon trading and peer-to-peer battles, and\nother possibilities.”\n\nHaving not received a mention since back in 2016, it’s reassuring that both\nfeatures are being worked on at Niantic.\n\nThe last time we heard about trading was when Niantic CEO and founder John\nHanke, took to the stage at Comic-Con.\n\n**Related:[Pokémon Go beginner’s\nguide](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/pokemon-go-beginner-s-guide-\nexplained)**\n\n![Pokemon\nTrading](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nWhile Hanke remained tight-lipped when it came to details, the Pokémon Go beta\ndid include a trading feature, which allowed players to send in-app trading\nrequests to nearby trainers. The other trainer then had the option to accept\nor decline.\n\nWhether the final version that comes to Pokémon Go will allow you to trade\nwith players around the globe via the internet remains to be seen. Starting\nwith Pokémon Red and Blue, the original games featured different types of\ncreatures, which could be swapped with beasts from other players via a\nphysical cable. Of course, Go won’t be limited in this way, but it’s\npreviously been reported that users will need an NFC-equipped smartphone in\norder to take advantage of the upcoming trading feature.\n\n## Pokémon Go Update: Field Research\n\nField Research has been Niantic’s way of introducing more exclusive Pokémon\ninto the game. The way they work is by giving players select tasks to\naccomplish such as hatching a certain number of eggs or catching certain types\nof the creatures.\n\nFor really rare Pokémon, the game includes ‘Special’ research tasks. In recent\nmonths this has given players the ability to get their hands on ‘Mew’, and you\ncan check out our guide below on how to get your hands on Gen-1’s most\nellusive creature.\n\nMore recently Niantic announced that you’ll soon be able to capture Zapdos if\nyou complete enough research quests in May 2018.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Pokémon Go News: Increasing the level cap\n\nAccording to Twitter user PokemonDoctorYT who was lucky enough to run into\nNiantic CEO John Hanke on a flight, the company currently [plans to increase\nthe game’s level cap](https://www.androidauthority.com/pokemon-go-zapdos-\nresearch-860039/) to an unspecified new maximum.\n\nIn the game’s initial days, earning enough XP to level up was a bit of a chore\nbecause of the limited number of activities you could engage in.\n\nHowever, with the new raids, and the daily XP bonuses you get for catching\nyour first creature of the day, levelling up has become much easier.\n\nPresumably this is why Niantic is thinking about raising the level cap past\nthe current maximum of 40, but we’re hoping that the higher levels will\nintroduce some new gameplay possibilities rather than just giving players more\nof what they’ve got already.\n\n## Pokémon Go Update: Gen-4 Pokémon to be revealed?\n\nAs part of this [same flight\nconversation](https://www.androidauthority.com/pokemon-go-zapdos-\nresearch-860039/), rumours also emerged that the game will shortly be\nincluding Pokémon from the fourth generation of the series.\n\nThe game originally launched with the series 1st generation of 150 creatures,\nbut over time we’ve seen the number of Pokémon you can catch, balloon to\naround 386 with the first three generations of the series now covered.\n\nHowever, Niantic is nowhere near done, and will apparently be moving into the\nfourth generation of the creatures soon.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Pokémon Go Events: What’s next after Pokémon Go Fest? **  \n**  \n\nPokémon Go’s first summer event, Pokémon Go Fest, didn’t exactly go according\nto plan back in 2017.\n\nFar from it.\n\nMany trainers were unable to access the game during the Chicago-based event,\ndue to “software and network problems,” as Niantic delicately put it in a\nrecent mea culpa/blog\n[post](https://www.nianticlabs.com/blog/gofestupdate072517/).\n\nHowever, the company is planning to put this disaster behind it with an all\nnew event [according to](https://www.androidauthority.com/pokemon-go-zapdos-\nresearch-860039/) PokemonDoctorYT.\n\nAt the moment there are few details about what this event will entail, but at\nthe very least we hope that Niantic puts plans in place to prevent the\nconnection issues that plagued its first attempt.\n\n## Pokémon Go Update: Submitting new Pokéstops\n\nThe final revelation that came out of this conversation was a little tidbit\nabout Pokéstops, which have remained more or less static since the game first\nreleased back in 2016.\n\nInitially, the Pokéstops in the game were brought over from Niantic’s previous\ngame Ingress. However the massive popularity of Pokémon Go made it clear that\nsome of these locations were in wildly inappropriate places.\n\nWhile Niantic was dealing with these issues it shelved the idea of introducing\nnew Pokéstops in the future, but it appears the company might be preparing to\n[re-introduce the feature](https://www.inverse.com/article/44290-pokemon-go-\ngeneration-4-rumors). The news will be music to the ears of anyone who lives\nin a small town without its fair share of the virtual locations, which have\nbecome increasingly important as a result of the introduction of the new\nResearch Tasks.\n\n**Are you still playing Pokémon Go?
