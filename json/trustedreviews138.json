Existing Rift titles like Robo Recall, The Climb, and Moss are promised\nat launch.\n\n> Introducing\n[#OculusQuest](https://twitter.com/hashtag/OculusQuest?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw),\nOur First 6DOF All-in-One VR System, Launching Spring 2019 //\n<https://t.co/wi4XF7TJ59>\n[pic.twitter.com/cuun3sFD0i](https://t.co/cuun3sFD0i)\n\n>\n\n> — Oculus (@oculus) [September 26,\n2018](https://twitter.com/oculus/status/1044998147557257217?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nAs well as offering a wireless approach, the Oculus Quest will offer six\ndegrees of freedom (6DoF), enabling wearers to roam freely within the physical\nand virtual space. The big upgrade on the $199 Oculus Go offers built-in\nspatial audio, as well as a 1600 x 1440 display and 64GB of built in storage.\n\n**Related:[Best VR headset 2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-vr-\nheadset)**\n\nThere’s no word yet on potential battery life offered by the system, nor on\nspecs like CPU or RAM, but those are likely to emerge in the month’s leading\nup to release, or later during the ongoing Oculus Connect event.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nFrom a design perspective the Quest appears to be slightly more rounded than\nthe two previous systems outed by Oculus, while there also appears to be\nattractive purple accents.\n\nNaturally, using the original Rift to connect to a high-end PC will still\nprovide the best VR experience, while the Oculus Go headset is seen as the\ncompany’s affordable entry-point to standalone VR experiences. The Quest sits\nin the middle, but it might just be the sweet spot for those unconvinced by VR\nthus far. The price is potentially appealing to console gamers, while\nproviding an experience akin to those platforms.\n\n**Will you be grabbing the Oculus Quest as soon as it launches next spring?\nDrop us a line @TrustedReviews on Twitter.**\n\n"}
