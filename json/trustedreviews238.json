The six-wheeled Starship robots, which have already\nbeen[handling last mile take-away\nfood](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/robots-will-soon-be-delivering-your-\ndomino-s-pizza-2950741) and grocery deliveries, are now adept handling your\npackages (stop giggling at the back).**\n\nThe £7.99 a month service requires folks in Milton Keynes to have their\ndeliveries routed a Starship storage facility in the city. They’ll then be\nable to schedule a delivery within the hour using the mobile app.\n\nStarship will remotely observe the stout little robots as they make their way\nto the recipients’ homes, navigating across roads and avoiding other human\npedestrians. The company also has positioned cameras in order to deter to\nthose folks who’d seek to impede the journey or, worse still, steal the\ncontents.\n\nThe company says Packages subscribers will be able to use the service wherever\nthey shop online, whether it be Amazon or ASOS. The firm says it will reduce\nthe need to wait around at home all day for a delivery and offer peace of mind\nthat packages aren’t sitting on the doorstep in all weather, in clear view of\npotential thieves.\n\n**Related:[Best robot vacuum cleaners\n2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-robot-vacuum-\ncleaners-3478303)**\n\nIt could be be perfect for Brits going on holiday too, because the company\nwill simply hold all of the packages for subscribers return home.\n\nThe [company says](https://starshipdeliveries.com/packages/): “Gone are the\ndays of missed delivery slips and waiting around at home for deliveries that\nmay never turn up.
