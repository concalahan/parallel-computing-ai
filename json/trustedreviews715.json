In side-by-side comparisons with the iPhone XS, recordingquality sounded tinny and distant. Google says it has tuned the Pixel 3microphones in order to minimise background noise and emphasise the spokenword. That may be the case, but the end result of that tuning is bad sound.In a statement, Google said: “We made several advances in the audio recordingcapabilities of Pixel 3, including enabling stereo recording in landscapemode. When recording outdoors, our tuning is specifically designed to reducebackground noise like wind and road noise and overly loud sounds and optimizefor audible speech. To achieve this, we selectively de-emphasize somefrequencies, which minimizes disruptive noises and optimizes the resultingaudio. We do extensive user testing of our products to ensure they are tunedfor real world usage, and we’re always looking at additional tuningopportunities based on user feedback.”**Are you an early Pixel 3 or Pixel 3 XL adopter?
