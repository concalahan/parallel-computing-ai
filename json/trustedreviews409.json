As you can see, each box is adorned with a large letter, seemingly\nconfirming the aforementioned naming scheme.\n\nThere’s a noticeable difference in packaging design, though. The Nexus 5X\nappears to be getting a squarer, sharper edged box, while the Nexus 6P\npackaging has rounded edges – perhaps as a nod to the very different phone\ndesigns we’ve been seeing for the two.\n\nThe report points out that the satellite images showing through both stylised\nletters are likely to be new stock [Android 6.0\nMarshmallow](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/android-m-features)\nwallpapers.\n\nThe boxes also contain a classic Nexus logo, the storage capacity of the phone\nwithin (in this case, 32GB for both), and a small silhouette of the phone.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n**Related:[Best Android Smartphones 2015](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-\nandroid-phones-1_round-up)**\n\nGoogle will officially unveil the new Nexus 5X and the Nexus 6P at an event to\nbe held on September 29 – that’s next Tuesday.\n\nAlso likely to appear at the event are further details concerning Android 6.0\nMarshmallow, a new Nexus tablet, and a revamped version of the Google\nChromecast.\n\n**Check out our smartphone buyer’s video guide below:**\n\n"}
