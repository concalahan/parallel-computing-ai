This public\nevent can be found on the newly introduced planet of Mars where you’ll be able\nto team up with friends or strangers to take down enemies and bag some loot.\n\nThe Protocol also contains unique weapons and cycling objectives so you don’t\nneed to worry about immediately repeating the same tasks in a hopeless grind\nfor loot. If anything, this is a change we’d like to see all of Destiny 2\nadopt.\n\nWarmind also comes with a new Raid Lair, Strikes, Public Events and finally, a\nnew NPC known as Ana Bray who can be found in The Tower for extra bits of loot\nand lore to uncover. Oh, and players will finally have access to an emote\nwheel, which means no more swapping out hard-earned cosmetics!\n\nYou can also expect a healthy of array of new weapons, armour and more to sink\nyour teeth into come May 8.\n\n**Related:[Best PS4\nGames](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/ps4-games-3431751)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe first raid activity for Warmind – **Spire of Stars** – will debut shortly\nafter the expansion’s release on Friday, May 11. More specifically, you and\nyour fireteam can dive in at 6PM GMT. Raid activities normally unlock long\nafter the expansion itself, making this an unusual change from the norm.\n\nIt’s worth keeping in mind that Spire of Stars isn’t a full raid, but a ‘lair’\nfeaturing a shorter, more contained mission. However, you can still expect\nplenty of loot and challenge when compared to standard missions.\n\n**Related:[Call of Duty Black Ops 4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/call-\nof-duty-black-ops-4-3373836)**\n\n**![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)**\n\n##  **Destiny 2 weekly reset** – What’s happening this week?\n\nBungie has detailed the [weekly\nreset](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/46754) for Destiny 2\nacross PS4, Xbox One and PC.
