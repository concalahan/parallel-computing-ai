{"result": 0, "title": "Fortnite Season 6: News, patch notes, skins, weapons and more", "description": "![fortnite](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe fifth season of [Fortnite: Battle\nRoyale](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/fortnite-battle-royale) was a\nbrilliant one, seeing the likes of Vikings and Kitsune Warriors doing battle\nas new areas appeared and old ones were demolished. As it drew to a close, a\nmysterious cube tore through the map, terraforming major locations in its\nwake. Now, Season 6 is finally upon us.\n\nArriving with the rather ominous tagline of “Darkness Rises,” things aren’t\nlooking good for the happy-go-lucky world. While at its core this season is\nstill the Fortnite we know and love, and as this battle pass takes us all the\nway through Halloween, this season looks to change the map and other elements\nup in some serious ways.\n\n## What is Fortnite Season 6?\n\nSeason 6 is the latest content drop in Fortnite Battle Royale. Every six weeks\nor so, a new battle pass is released, costing 950 V-Bucks (around £10).\nFortnite doesn’t require players to purchase each battle pass to play, but for\nthose looking for an inexpensive way to unlock new skins, more V-Bucks, pets,\nand other cosmetics, this content bundle costs around the same price as a\nsingle common skin.\n\n## Fortnite Season 6 – Balloons!\n\nMap traversal is the name of the game this season, and now you’ll be able to\nreach new heights with Fortnite’s latest item. Balloons can be found as floor\nloot, from chests, supply drops, llamas, vending machines, and drop in a stack\nof 20. Just be careful how high you fly as balloons don’t last forever…\n\n## Fortnite Season 6 Fortnitemares – New Event\n\n**UPDATE: End time and new in-game event**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n###  Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nThe Fortnitemares event is due to come to a close on Sunday, November 4 at 1\nPM Eastern Time. What’s more, it’ll be ending with another in-game event,\nsimilar to what we saw with the rocket launch. Epic hasn’t hinted what the\nevent will be, but if it’s anything like the last, you won’t want to miss it.\n\nOriginal story follows…\n\n****\n\nWhat could make Fortnite even more brutal? Even more ways to end you, of\ncourse!\n\nThe cube, which is known as ‘Kevin’ online, is fighting back. Those cube\nfragments you’ve seen in-game will now spawn monsters. Joy…\n\nThe larger cube fragments can be found near the corrupted areas of the\nfloating island, while small cube fragments spawn randomly throughout the\nmatch. Killing the onslaught of enemies has a few upsides, thankfully, namely\nthe chance of loot, and if you dispose of a cube fiend or brute, you’ll be\nrewarded with a small amount of shield.\n\nIf you’re looking for help with the [Season 6 Fortnitemares\nchallenges](https://trustedreviews.com/news/fortnite-guide-complete-\nfortnitemares-challenges-3610226), we’ve got a guide just for that.\n\n## Fortnite Season 6 – New Six Shooter weapon\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIt’s hiiigh noon… Wait. Wrong game. So, the new weapon is a shiny new revolver\nwith a base damage of 34/36/38, respectively. Shooting from the hip holds a\nfaster rate of fire, but the trade off is the accuracy of aiming down the\nsight. You’ll find the six shooter as floor loot, from chests and vending\nmachines, and it requires medium bullets as ammo.\n\n## Fortnite Season 6 – Glide everywhere!\n\nYou’ll now be able to redeploy your glider in any game mode. Anyone who’s\nplayed soaring 50s will be right at home with this one. The in-game rule is\nyou need to be 10 metres in the air for the glider to be able to redeploy. So,\nyou know, make sure you jump off somewhere high enough and you’ll be golden.\n\nIt’s worth mentioning, Epic notes this new feature is for everyone to test, so\nif it breaks the game too much, there’s a chance it may fly off into the\nsunset.\n\n## Fortnite Season 6 – Massive playground update\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAs always, Playground mode continues to evolve with more options for those\nlooking for a break from the shooty-bang of Battle Royale. Here’s the full\nlist of everything that’s available as of patch 6.20.\n\n  * Port-A-Challenge\n  * Obstacle Course\n  * Collect the tokens and avoid the obstacles while honing your building skills.\n  * Building Challenge\n  * Build the structure as fast as possible.\n  * Firing Range\n  * Take out as many dummies as you can within the time limit.\n  * Spiky Stadium v2\n  * Once inside the new Spiky Stadium, players will respawn at designated spawn points inside the playspace.\n  * Vending machines provide grenades and Traps to allow you to customize your play.\n  * Port-A-Pirateship\n  * A re-creation of the minigame shown off by SXVXN.\n  * Spawns two large wooden Pirate ships.\n  * The minigame will split players into two teams, with the goal of destroying the other team’s ship.\n  * Port-A-Pirateship Ironclad Edition\n  * Spawns two large metal Pirate ships.\n  * Grenades and Rockets are provided for maximum destruction\n  * New Vending Machines have been added across the map to provide more Traps and weapons.\n  * A new respawn button has been added to the in-game player menu.\n\n## Fortnite Season 6 Challenges – What are they?\n\nEach week both free and paid battle pass users get access to different\nchallenges. These can be simple tasks like killing so many other players,\nfinding chests, or searching for a hidden star. The amount of challenges each\nplayer has varies depending on whether you’re a free user or a paid user. Paid\nusers get more challenges, and can unlock more content overall from the battle\npass, making the paid option quite attractive to more experienced players.\n\nWhen a challenge is completed, a certain amount of battle stars is awarded,\nwhich in turn ranks up battle pass tiers. You _can_ level up tiers just by\nplaying the game, but the progress is much, much slower.\n\nAs with previous seasons, not all challenges are as straightforward as they\nappear. Thankfully, we’re here to help. Every week at Trusted Reviews you’ll\nfind a guide for each of the new challenges. So if there are any you’re\nstruggling with, we’ve got your back.\n\n  * **Week 1** : [How to complete the Season 6 Week 1 Challenges](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/fortnite-guide-how-to-complete-the-season-6-week-1-challenges-3594101)\n  * **Week 2:** [How to complete the Season 6 Week 2 Challenges](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-complete-the-season-6-week-2-challenges-3597851)\n  * **Week 3:** [How to complete the Season 6 Week 3 Challenges](https://trustedreviews.com/news/fortnite-how-to-complete-season-6-week-3-challenges-3602540)\n  * **Week 4:** [How to complete the Season 6 Week 4 Challenges](https://trustedreviews.com/news/fortnite-guide-season-6-week-4-challenges-3606670)\n  * **Week 5:** [How to complete the Season 6 Week 5 Challenges](https://trustedreviews.com/news/fortnite-guide-season-6-week-5-challenges-3610698)\n  * **Week 6:** How to complete the Season 6 Week 6 Challenges\n\n## **Fortnite Season 6 – The Quadcrasher!**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nWhat happens when you cross an ATK with a monster truck? You get this fast-\nmoving Goliath that’s capable of tearing down walls and climbing mountains in\na flash. If you’re looking to zip around the map or take down enemy\nstructures, then this is the vehicle for you.\n\n## Fortnite Season 6 – Tournaments!\n\nFancy proving your skills in a ranked setting with a matchmaking system? Click\non the tournament tab when selecting a game or check out this handy video\nbelow for how it all works.\n\n## Fortnite Season 6 New Item – Chiller!\n\nSick of people always jumping the moment they grab a shotgun? Drop down a\nchiller and laugh as their feet turn to ice-cubes, causing them to lose\nmobility. You should totally watch the video for a neat trick you can pull off\nwith a ramp. It’s quite cruel, but also very funny.\n\n## Fortnite Season 6 New LTM – Disco Domination\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIt’s time for an all-new game mode. Disco Domination was first teased via\nFornite’s in-game message of the day (that thing that pops up when you load\nit, for those unaware). According to that message, the new mode requires\nplayers to “capture and defend dance floors around the island using emotes to\nearn points.” Now we know what exactly it is.\n\nThe short version is two teams of 50 battle for control of one of several\ndancefloors. When no enemies are present on the dancefloor, players emote to\nraise the disco ball. So dance, shoot, dance, essentially. Anyone else really\npumped for this?\n\nHere be the patch notes direct from\n[Epic](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/patch-notes/v6-02) to give you\nan idea of how it all works:\n\n  * Two teams of fifty players.\n  * Respawning will be turned on until the third (last) storm circle.\n  * Five dance floors will appear on the map whenever the storm is not moving.\n  * Emoting on a dance floor when no enemies are present will raise a disco ball in the center of the floor, and capture it for your team.\n  * The more friendly players dancing on a floor, the faster it will be captured.\n  * Once a floor is captured, it will begin filling the team’s “dance bar” on the HUD, until either an enemy stands on it or the current storm timer ends and the storm begins to move. The first team to fill their dance bar to 100% will win the match.\n  * The dance floors in the later stages of the match fill the bar more quickly, so don’t give up if your team is behind!\n  * It is not possible to build on or over the dance floors, but they can be protected by surrounding them with a fort.\n  * Glider redeploy is activated in this mode, press jump while falling to use your glider.\n  * This mode uses 50v50 levels of loot and resources.\n\n## Fortnite Seasons 6 Skins – What are the new battle pass skins?\n\nIt wouldn’t be a battle pass if there wasn’t a heap of new exciting skins, and\nthis season is no different. With the theme of Halloween prevalent throughout,\nSeason 6’s main focus is on fairytale monsters and heroes. And a DJ llama.\nBecause it’s Fortnite, and Fortnite loves slightly off-beat wackiness. Cuddle\nTeam Leader FTW!\n\nThere’s a total of seven skins to unlock, with two of them being customisable.\nAnd yes, [we’ve got a guide for\nthose](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/fortnite-guide-how-to-complete-the-\nseason-6-week-1-challenges-3594101).\n\nHere’s the who and when you unlock each skin. There’s also an image at the top\nof the screen of the skins for your perusing pleasure.\n\n  * DJ Yonder – Tier 1\n  * Calamity – Tier 1\n  * Giddy Up – Tier 23\n  * Fable – Tier 47\n  * Dusk – Tier 71\n  * Nightshade – Tier 86\n  * Dire – Tier 100\n\n**Related:[Best Gaming Keyboard](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\ngaming-keyboard-3500376)**\n\n## Fortnite Season 6 Server Status – Is it down?\n\nAfter a brief bit of trouble on Xbox One, servers are now working properly on\nall platforms!\n\n## Fortnite Season 6 Announce Trailer\n\n## Fortnite Season 6 Skins – How to unlock Calamity and Dire\n\nAs with Drift and Ragnarok, both Calamity and Dire can be levelled up to gain\naccess to unique customisations. Calamity starts off with a cowgirl outfit,\nthen as the XP grows, ends up going full-on Van Helsing. Dire, however, goes\nthrough the different stages of lycanthropy. He starts off as a human, then\nbecomes a teenwolf type, before turning into a full werewolf. Both skins are\nactually really quite cool, so it’s definitely worth taking the time to fully\nmax out both.\n\nFor a complete breakdown of how to unlock each of the customisations, check\nout the [super handy guide](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/fortnite-\nguide-how-to-complete-the-season-6-week-1-challenges-3594101).\n\n## Fortnite Season 6 – Pets!\n\nWe’re still chasing the details but according to the video right above this,\nthe battle pass introduces adorable pets, including bonesy the dog, scales the\ndragon, and camo the lizard. Both Bonesy and Scales even come with their own\nunlockable colour schemes, too.\n\n**Related:[Best Nintendo Switch\nGames](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/nintendo-switch-games-3435122)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Fortnite Season 6 Map – Changes everywhere!\n\nThe crack in the sky is gone, but things are getting spooky. Floating islands\nin the sky, and a new haunted mansion join a corn field, because Fortnite\nisn’t tense enough apparently, and new corrupted areas. It’s definitely worth\nvisiting the corrupted areas if you’re a fan of multiple chests spawns. Just\nbe careful no one else is landing with you and you’ll have end-game loot right\nfrom the start.\n\nIt’s also worth your time checking out the Wailing Woods revamp. The maze is\nnow a sectioned off, Area 51-style area. Where the main cabin was in the\nmiddle, if you now mine down, you’ll end up in a secret underground lab,\ncomplete with an escape rift. Oh, and if you find a trap and stick it at the\nbottom of the shaft, everyone will hate you but your kill count will\nskyrocket.\n\n## Fortnite Season 6 Update – What are the big changes?\n\n**Audio Cues**\n\nThis is another big one. Before, all we could hear were footsteps, with no\nindication as to where those footsteps were coming from. Were they below you?\nWere they in the roof? Now you’ll get a different sound depending on where the\nother player is.\n\nHere are the patch notes to give you an idea of how that’ll work:\n\n“Changed the processing of footsteps to add more contrast between above/below.\nBelow steps now sound more “echoey” like they’re coming from the basement.\n\n“Footsteps will decrease in pitch the farther they are below you, and increase\nin pitch the higher they are above you.\n\n“The volume of footsteps blocked by terrain, buildings, or player built\nstructures has been increased slightly.”\n\n**Shadow Stones**\n\nThis new consumable applies a shadow form to the player and changes the game\ndrastically. It grants a movement speed increase, a higher jump, and removes\nfall damage. You’ll also be able to – wait for it! – go invisible when\nstationary.\n\nOh, but that’s not all. It’ll also grant the phase ability from Save the\nWorld, letting players teleport short distances in a flash. You can’t use\nweapons while the effect is active, but this doesn’t sound like an offensive\nitem. You can also cancel this 45-second ability by holding down the aim-down-\nsights button.\n\n**Related:[Best Gaming Headset](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\ngaming-headsets-3431813)**\n\n![fortnite](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Fortnite Vaulted Weapons – What weapons have been removed?\n\nStarting straight out the gates, the Impulse Grenade, Suppressed Submachine\nGun, Light Machine Gun, Bouncer, and Remote Explosives have all been vaulted,\nmeaning they won’t be available in Fortnite outside of the Playground mode.\n\nAdding to the above, you can also say goodbye to the dual pistols, semi-auto\nsniper, and the remote guided missile.\n\n## Fortnite Custom Controller Bindings – Play your way\n\nYou’ll now be able to fully customise the controller rather than sticking to\nthe presets. The importance of this is it allows Combat Pro players to move up\nto Builder Pro as you’ll be able to set which triggers place which building\nsections.\n\nNo more needing to turn a roof into a ramp to avoid extra button presses.\nHurray!\n\n## Fortnite Music – Select your own in-game music.\n\nPlayers can now unlock new music to blast. You’ll be able to equip different\nsongs in the locker section, just as you would a new skin or glider.\n\n## Fortnite Season 6 Patch Notes\n\n**Patch v6.21**\n\n  * Balloons added \n    * Epic rarity \n      * Comes with 20 deployable balloons. \n        * Allows the player to defy gravity by holding up to 6 balloons at a time.\n        * Primary fire button to inflate a balloon, secondary fire button to let go of a balloon.\n      * Can be found from floor loot, chests, Supply Drops, Supply Llamas, and Vending Machines.\n      * NOTE: Don’t float too high for too long, balloons only last so long at max build height.\n  * Grappler \n    * When grappling as a vehicle passenger, the velocity of your vehicle is factored into the grapple force. \n      * Only occurs in instances where vehicle velocity will be a net gain to grapple force.\n    * Grappling as a vehicle passenger will now cause the vehicle to travel in a straight line to its destination rather than traveling in an arc.\n  * Vaulted \n    * Semi-Auto Sniper\n    * Guided Missile\n    * Dual Pistols \n      * These items will remain available in Playground Mode.\n  * 25% of explosive damage will now penetrate through structures and the environment.\n\n**The latest on the glider redeploy system in Battle Royale**\n\n“We’ve finished our first week of Glider Re-deploy being available in all\nmodes. During this time we’ve been collecting internal data and monitoring\nconstructive feedback from all of you. We understand that not all players\nagree with this change, but we would like to continue with this functionality\nin the game based on the positive results we’ve been seeing.\n\n“As this feature remains available, we’ll begin making quality of life changes\nto its functionality.

We also plan on\nadding additional changes in future updates.\n\n“Thanks for the discussion and feedback you’ve provided.

What more could you\nwant?\n\n**Fortnitemares – Explore Hexsylvania once more**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe Vlad Moon Rising questline is now back in Save the World, complete with\nupgraded additional narrative content for those looking to play something a\nlittle spookier this Halloween.\n\nThe event also sees the return of last year’s heroes – deep breath – Marine\nCorpse Ramirez, Skull Trooper Jonesy, Hazard the 13th, Catstructor Penny,\nShuriken Master Llamurai, Sarah Hotep, and Ranger Beetlejess. Also, any\nfounders who log in during the next few weeks will be treated to Skull Ranger\nRamirez and Brainiac Jonesy free of charge.\n\nAnd that’s not all. Over in the event store, Calamity from Battle Royale\nenters the fray. She’s a mythic soldier with the new six shooter perk: The\nfirst 6 rounds in pistol magazines deal 12% increased damage and 24% increased\nimpact. Nice!\n\nSave the World is also 50% off at the moment, so if you’re looking for a legit\nway to earn a large amount of V-Bucks without getting clickbaited into\nwatching a YouTube vid, now’s the time to take the plunge.\n\n**Two Factor Authentication Bonus**\n\nAnyone who enables two-factor authentication will be granted an additional 50\nArmory Slots, 10 Backpack Slots, and 1 Legendary Troll Stash Llama. If you\nhaven’t already, this is worth doing. Not only do you get the Boogie Down\nemote for Battle Royale, but it adds an extra layer of security to your\naccount. So no one else should, hopefully, be able to login and buy V-Bucks on\nyour account.\n\n**New Weekly Weapons**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nTwo weapons have been added to the weekly shop.

Joy.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**New Event – Cram Session**\n\nIn this event, it’s all about levelling up. Earn extra XP by completing mini-\nboss alerts, which can drop double the loot. There’s also four new questlines,\ncontaining 10 stages, each with increasing rewards. If you haven’t played Save\nthe World in a while, now’s the perfect time to jump back in.\n\n**Related:[Best Gaming Keyboards](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\ngaming-keyboard-3500376)**\n\n## Fortnite News – PS4 crossplay beta\n\nAfter much reluctance in the past, Sony has announced that it is finally\nbringing crossplay capabilities to the [PlayStation\n4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/playstation-4) platform for select\nthird-party content. Obviously, the chief among those is Fortnite: Battle\nRoyale, which is currently available for every platform under the sun.\n\nPosting on its [official\nblog](https://blog.us.playstation.com/2018/09/26/extended-fortnite-cross-play-\nbeta-launches-on-ps4-starting-today/), Sony has confirmed that Fortnite PS4\nCrossplay support has started rolling out, and is the start of a company-wide\npolicy change to allow such features to be supported on Sony platforms.\n\n**Related:[Best Gaming Headsets](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\ngaming-headsets-3431813)**\n\n> Fortnite cross-platform play starts today in open beta.
