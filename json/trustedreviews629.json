Some games on the Xbox One Salready supported this, but in conjunction with Ultra HD and the othergraphical enhancements, it should look more spectacular here than ever before.But it’s not as simple as firing up your favourite game and enjoying the newgraphics. Each developer for every game has to go out of its way to update agame in order for it to take advantage of the One X’s new hardware. Look outfor the ‘One X Enhanced’ label on game marketing to see whether the titleyou’re most excited about will look any better.**Buy the Xbox One Xfrom[Tesco](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7090&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-tescocampaign&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tesco.com%2Fdirect%2Fxbox-one-x-1tb-with-far-cry-5-console-bundle%2F267-9173.prd%3FskuId%3D267-9173)|[Amazon.com](http://amzn.to/2GOy2C4)**All of this is possible because the One X is, according to Microsoft, almostfour times more powerful than the Xbox One S. There’s an eight-core AMDprocessor running at 2.3GHz, and a much-improved AMD graphics chip with 40Compute Units (versus 12 on the older models). There’s 12GB of high-speedmemory for the console to use, with around 9GB set aside for games andgraphics. The whole lot is cooled by a vapour chamber that channels heat tothe rear of the console via a state-changing liquid/gas copper heat pipe, tobe deposited in a heatsink and cooled by fans. This is why the One X is ableto be so powerful, yet so small. That, and a load of electrical wizardry thatmakes each individual component substantially more efficient. This is a littlebox of big tricks.Speaking of little boxes, the 1TB hard disk is laughably small in an age where4K games weigh in at over 100GB. You’re going to want to invest in an externalUSB hard disk if you don’t want to have to keep deleting games to make spacefor others. Fortunately, Xbox One consoles do at least let you run games froman external disk, so you don’t have to worry about moving them back and forth.Now, let’s take a look at the performance of the machine.[ Next  Performance and 4K gaming ](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/xbox-one-x-performance-4k-gaming)"}
