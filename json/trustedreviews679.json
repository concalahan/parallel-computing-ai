Now we’re hearing that technical issues plaguing the device\nmay be unassailable.\n\nAccording to noted Apple tipster Sonny Dickson the product is “doomed to\nfailure” unless Apple engineers overcome multiple issues, including\noverheating issues that are affecting AirPower’s ability to effectively charge\nthe devices.\n\nHe says the device – which is supposed to charge an iPhone, AirPods and Apple\nWatch simultaneously – may be cancelled completely, ‘dramatically’ delayed\neven further or completely re-envisioned from the sneak peak Apple unveiled\nback in September 2017.\n\n**Read more:[iPhone XR vs iPhone XS vs iPhone XS\nMax](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-xr-vs-iphone-xs-vs-iphone-xs-\nmax-3565104)**\n\nIn a [blog post](http://sonnydickson.com/2018/09/16/what-really-happened-to-\napples-airpower/) he writes: “Currently the device produces far too much heat,\nwhich causes performance setbacks, and can affect the ability of the devices\nto charge if they become too warm in the process. It also affects the ability\nof Apple’s custom charging chip, which runs a stripped down version of iOS, to\nfunction as intended.”\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Xiaomi Mi A2](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Xiaomi smartphones will be available from Three in November\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/xiaomi-three-uk-3612189 \"Xiaomi\nsmartphones will be available from Three in November\")\n\n  * [ ![ps1](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### PlayStation Classic: Sony releases complete list of 20 games on the\nconsole\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/playstation-classic-mini-release-date-\npreorder-3583798 \"PlayStation Classic: Sony releases complete list of 20 games\non the console\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Hive View Outdoor](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Hive View Outdoor security camera can catch burglars before they strike\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/hive-view-outdoor-security-\ncamera-3612152 \"Hive View Outdoor security camera can catch burglars before\nthey strike\")\n\n  * \n\nHe goes onto detail ‘buggy inter-device communication’, issues with charging\nactivation, speed and accuracy of charge levels. There’s also several\nmechanical and interference issues to overcome, Dickson says.\n\nHe adds: “Apple’s engineers have been experiencing both hardware and software\nissues with the communication between AirPower and devices placed on the mat,\n-especially- the communication of Apple Watch and AirPod charging data to the\niPhone, which monitors the charge level of all devices placed on the mat.”\n\nThe outright cancellation of the product would be a dramatic development,\nconsidering Apple is synonymous with engineering excellence. Even if the\ncompany does get it out eventually, AirPower is the latest Apple product\nsubject to a lengthy delay. Both AirPods and HomePod arrived long after the\npromised release date.\n\n**Do you think Apple will ever deliver AirPower? Drop us a line\n@TrustedReviews on Twitter.**\n\n"}
