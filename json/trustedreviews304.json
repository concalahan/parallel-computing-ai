It lets you trigger actions on other\napps, web services and devices automatically every time certain conditions are\nmet. These trigger > action relationships used to be called ‘recipes’, but\nwill now be known as Applets – more on this later.\n\n**Related:[26 brilliantly useful IFTTT recipes to simplify your\nlife](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ifttt-recipes-smart-home-automation-\nnest-philips-hue)**\n\n![ifttt](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nIFTTT is accompanied by another app called DO, which lets you manage one-off\nactions that need activating each time in order to run – like automatically\nasking a specific Slack channel or user if they want coffee as you approach\nthe office. These are marked in IFTTT’s repository as ‘DO’.\n\n## What are IFTTT Applets?\n\nAs mentioned, the trigger > action relationships have always been known as\n‘recipes’, but that’s all changing. From now on, they will be dubbed\n‘Applets’. There are no major changes to the way things work, but there are a\nfew differences worth being aware of.\n\nEach Applet you enable will still trigger an ‘if this then that’ action when\nthe relevant conditions are met, but now Applets can trigger multiple actions,\ninstead of just one. Once the first action is completed, a second, third,\nfourth, etc, can also be triggered.\n\n**Related:[Amazon Echo review](https://www.trustedreviews.com/amazon-echo-\nreview)**\n\n![ifttt\napplets](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIt’s an ability users have been requesting for some time, and it looks like\nthe devs have finally listened. The new Applets are live as of now, but\nthere’s no need to worry – all your existing recipes will still work under the\nnew system.  \n\n## Can I start making my own Applets?\n\nUnfortunately, IFTTT has decided that, for the time being, the new\nfunctionality will only be available to service providers and product makers.\nThat means, unless you’re a business with a product or web service, you’re not\ngoing to be able to make your own Applets to trigger multiple actions from one\nevent. At least, not just yet.\n\nAlongside announcing Applets, the company is introducing something called the\n‘maker tier’, which is set to arrive in early-2017. This will allow any user\nto apply directly to IFTTT for access to the enhanced functionality, including\nmultiple actions.\n\n![ifttt](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAnyone can apply, but you’ll have to convince the company you’re worthy of the\nextra abilities by pitching the kind of Applets you want to create. We also\nwouldn’t be surprised if some kind of premium was attached to the ‘maker tier’\nonce it’s properly off the ground.\n\n## Why all the changes?\n\nIFTTT has been trying to get its automation system into third-party apps and\nservices as standard for a while now, and the kind of multi-action\nfunctionality offered by Applets seems geared towards giving other companies\n(and eventually power users) more control over automating their products.\nExpect to see a lot more of IFTTT, especially as smart home products begin to\nbecome more popular.\n\nThe company is also merging IFTTT and DO into one app, after previously\nsplitting the two services. So it seems the whole thing is about streamlining\nthe service and improving integration.\n\n**Watch The Refresh: The best tech gossip and reviews every week  \n**\n\n**What do you think of IFTTT’s recent changes?
