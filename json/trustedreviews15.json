Speaking to [Outlook\nIndia](https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/whatsapps-status-feature-to-\nstart-showing-ads-confirms-vp-chris-daniels/319371), the firm’s VP Chris\nDaniels said this will be the primary cash source for WhatsApp moving forward.\n\nAs the WSJ predicted, the ads will be geared to helping businesses reach\npeople on WhatsApp. Daniels said: “We are going to be putting ads in ‘Status.’\nThat is going to be [the] primary monetisation mode for the company as well as\nan opportunity for businesses to reach people on WhatsApp.”\n\nThe good news, the ads are heading to a place where many WhatsApp users are\nunlikely to see them. The Status tab enables users to post text updates,\nphotos, animated GIFs, videos and more. Like Instagram’s stories, they\ndisappear after 24-hours. Facebook says 450 million users are already using\nthe Status page, but I just checked, and my Status tab says: “No recent\nupdates to show right now.” Just as it always has.\n\nWhether users see the ads or not, it’s sure to raise concerns over targeting.\nWill advertisers have access to the topics being discussed by users in order\nto show relevant ads? We’re sure to see some empty pledge form Facebook about\nhow much it cares about user privacy, regardless.\n\n**Related:[Best VPN](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-vpn-3470328)**\n\nThe [original report](https://public.eagleapi.io/magpie/time-inc/trusted-\nreviews/AUTO/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Ffacebooks-new-\nmessage-to-whatsapp-make-\nmoney-1533139325%3Fmod%3Drss_Technology&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.trustedreviews.com%2Fnews%2Fwhatsapp-\nstatus-\nads-3522395&vars%5BipcTags.contentId%5D=3522395&vars%5Bmagpie_data.ga_id%5D=1432006214.1539198572)\nback in August said the roll out was being planned for early 2019. It said\nWhatsApp will charge companies between $0.005 and $0.09 per potential customer\nreached. Considering WhatsApp is offering access to more than 1 billion active\ndaily users, that’s could add up quickly.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nFacebook paid more than $19 billion for WhatsApp, so it’s understandable the\ncompany would start to seek some return on that investment at some point. The\nmove to charge businesses for access to WhatsApp users comes as the company\nseeks out a revenue stream. Previously, the app had dropped a $0.99 annual\nsubscription fee following the Facebook buyout in 2016.\n\n**Will the ads bother you?
