For now though, let’s talk about\nits introduction.\n\nImmediately, the game is terrifying and plays on primal fears. It’s getting\nlate, you’re home alone. The soundtrack is bassy and throbbing, and the\nlighting picks up small details, these elements and many others combining to\nmake something as simple as walking down a hallway to watch television nerve-\njangling.\n\n![The Blackout\nClub](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThis seems… fine\n\nThe introductory level, which delivers a one-two punch of solid scares and a\ndecent understanding of how to play the game, could be the perfect way to\nspend Halloween. It immediately draws in elements of Amnesia, BBC golden-age\nhorror (think a bloodless Quatermass and you’re halfway there) and immersive\nsims, delivering a spooky 15 minutes before you even get started with the co-\nop multiplayer gameplay on offer.\n\nA disclaimer: I’m not a horror aficionado. I’m famously scared of horror\ngames, and have endured years of mocking after I burst into panicked tears\nduring a round of multiplayer Slender, sobbing my way through a rendition of\nThe Lion King’s Hakuna Matata to try and calm myself as a player-controlled\nmonster closed in.\n\n![The Blackout\nClub](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nI regret my earlier assessment\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Google Home Hub YouTube](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Will Google Home Hub ever get Netflix?

But The Blackout Club’s opening scared the hell out of me, and\nit could scare the hell out of you too, if you give it a chance. Expect a full\npreview of The Blackout Club on the site sometime soon, where we’ll be trying\nto work out if the game’s multiplayer can keep the atmosphere when there are\nfour friends running around screaming about sleepwalkers and how they’re\ntrying to wiggle to safety.\n\nFor now, there’s a short and spooky 45 minutes of horror hidden in the game’s\ntutorial, and it’s a real Halloween treat.\n\n"}
