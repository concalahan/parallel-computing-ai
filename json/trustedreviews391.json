Game Freak has redesigned the classic formula so it\nworks for newcomers and veterans alike, and we can’t wait.\n\n_Trusted Reviews_ has compiled everything you need to know about Pokémon:\nLet’s Go, Pikachu! and Pokémon: Let’s Go, Eevee! including all the latest\nnews, release date, gameplay, trailers and more.\n\n**Related:**[ **Best Nintendo Switch\nGames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/nintendo-switch-games-3435122)\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Pokémon: Let’s Go, Pikachu! and Pokémon: Let’s Go, Eevee! – Preview by Tom\nHatfield\n\nThis weekend at EGX, Pokémon Let’s Go was publically demoed for the first\ntime, so this lapsed Pokéfan stepped up to take a look.\n\nThe first thing that struck me was how familiar it was. Pokémon Let’s Go is a\nloose remake of Pokémon Red/Blue, and the short demo consisted only of\nViridian Forest, the first proper battling area of the series (when I tried to\nwalk back towards Pallet Town the demonstrator said they weren’t ready to show\nthat yet).\n\nThe second thing I noticed was the controller. I was playing with the new\nPokéball controller, which nestled surprisingly well even in my large, clumsy\nhands. Honestly, I found it much more comfortable than the times I’ve tried to\nplaying something with a single Switch joy-con. There’s also both a strap and\na hoop for your ring finger, just in case you attempt to throw the ball for\nreal.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThe downside is the buttons, there are only two, an A button on the top analog\nstick and a B button recessed into the ball itself. Clicking down on the\nanalog stick to select an option isn’t exactly intuitive, and can lead to you\naccidentally moving the stick and scrolling away from what you want to select.\n\n**Related:[Upcoming Switch\nGames](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/upcoming-nintendo-switch-\ngames-3522184)**\n\n![pokemon let's go\n](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nCatching Pokémon in Let’s Go doesn’t feature a Pokémon battle, but instead\nworks a lot like Pokémon Go, with the player using the motion controls in the\ncontroller to toss Pokéballs at wild Pokémon (you can also feed them berries\nto make them easier to catch).\n\nWhile throwing the ball is based on your motion, whether you actually hit the\ntarget or not is based on timing, not aim. There’s a circular indicator on\neach Pokémon, and if you throw the ball when the circle is smallest you’ll\nhave the best chance of catching them.\n\nSome Pokémon are harder to catch than others. I ran into a Butterfree that was\nconstantly moving around the screen, only vulnerable to Pokéballs for brief\nmoments as it passed through the centre, making a strong case for catching a\nMetapod instead and evolving it.\n\nWhen you do catch a Pokémon the controller vibrates gently during those brief\nmoments where it tries to break free, and if you hold it up to your ear you\ncan even hear its call.\n\n**Related:[Super Smash Bros\nUltimate](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/smash-bros-ultimate-release-\ndate-news-gameplay-2949964)**\n\n![pokemon let's go\n](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nBattles are more straightforward, working exactly as you’d expect from Pokémon\nRed/Blue, only with a major graphical upgrade. Pikachu’s thunderbolt, in\nparticular, looks terrific, although sadly he was the only Pokémon I had with\na flashy elemental attack.\n\n## Updated Impressions\n\nI had a lot of fun tossing Pokéballs around for a few minutes, but I did find\nmyself wondering if I’d want to use the Pokéball controller for a whole game,\nor whether I’d rather undock my Switch and play Pokémon in the traditional\nportable manner. But even if Let’s Go proves to be just a graphical upgrade of\nRed/Blue, I think it’ll still be worth it for the chance to see Kanto how it\nalways looked in my imagination.\n\n## Pokémon: Let’s Go, Pikachu! and Pokémon: Let’s Go, Eevee! – What is it?\n\nDeveloped exclusively for Nintendo Switch, Pokémon: Let’s Go, Pikachu! and\nPokémon: Let’s Go, Eevee! is inspired by the likes of Pokemon GO and other\npocket monster [RPG](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-rpg)s that came\nbefore it. It’s also a nostalgic love letter to past outings as it transports\nplayers back into the Kanto region will all of the original 151 creatures\nyou’d expect.\n\nAnd, of course, your mission is to become the Pokemon Champion and catch ‘em\nall!\n\n## Pokémon: Let’s Go, Pikachu! and Pokémon: Let’s Go, Eevee! trailer – how\ndoes it look?\n\nYou can watch the latest trailer in all its adorable goodness below:\n\n## Pokémon: Let’s Go, Pikachu! and Pokémon: Let’s Go, Eevee! setting – Where\ndoes it take place?\n\nJudging by the fantastic reveal trailer, Let’s Go, Pikachu and Let’s Go, Eevee\nare a reinvention of Pokemon Yellow both in terms of spirit and setting.\nYou’ll begin the game as a young child settling into the Kanto region before\nsetting out to become a Pokemon Master.\n\n> Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee! are based on\nPokémon Yellow: Special Pikachu Edition, which first launched in Japan in\n1998! <https://t.co/kXLdxUMjjA>\n[#PokemonLetsGo](https://twitter.com/hashtag/PokemonLetsGo?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n[pic.twitter.com/wxxCJH5Cfc](https://t.co/wxxCJH5Cfc)\n\n>\n\n> — Pokémon (@Pokemon) [May 30,\n2018](https://twitter.com/Pokemon/status/1001637233927974912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nIconic towns, gyms, and dungeons appear to have been reinvented with a high-\ndefinition visual presentation we simply haven’t seen the series tackle\nbefore. It looks adorably brilliant, and we’re excited to explore the entire\nworld later this year.\n\n## Pokémon: Let’s Go, Pikachu! and Pokémon: Let’s Go, Eevee! Poke ball Plus\n\nAt launch, Let’s Go, Pikachu! and Let’s Go, Eevee! will release alongside a\nnew accessory known as the Poke ball Plus. This new peripheral can be used to\nplay the game in its entirety, whether its catching Pokemon or engaging in\nbattle across Kanto.\n\nIn addition to motion controls, it lights up and acts as a traditional\ncontroller for the Nintendo Switch, although it can’t be attached the console\nitself in any fashion. Game Freak has said, “when catching a Pokémon in the\nNintendo Switch games, players will be able to feel it moving within the\ndevice.”\n\nPricing for the Poke ball Plus hasn’t been confirmed, although we imagine it\nwill be available separately as a part of a bundle of sorts alongside the\ngame.\n\n**Are you looking forward to this new Pokemon adventure?
