It’s a decentcamera setup, but one that even so has been beaten by the [Google Pixel2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-2).The camera also happens to be one of the biggest areas of improvement for theiPhone XS.You’ve still got two 12-megapixel sensors, one for regular photos and one forzoomed shots, but Apple says the sensor has been completely rebuilt withlarger pixels. The front-facing 7-megapixel camera is also faster than beforeand it can now shoot video with stereo-sound.Like the Google Pixel 2, the iPhone XS uses computational photography and theneural engine inside the A12 Bionic to power the new Smart-HDR mode. Thistakes multiple shots as soon as you open the camera app and it’ll even shoot afew overexposed shots to improve the highlights and shadows.Both phones have a portrait mode and they both allow you to alter the strengthof the bokeh effect in post-production.## **iPhone XS vs Samsung Galaxy S9 – Price**When it launched in April 2018, the Samsung Galaxy S9 retailed for £749 forthe regular version and £869 for the larger Plus-sized version.The iPhone XS is a lot pricier, starting at £999 for the base 64GB version andrising to £1099 for the larger 6.5-inch Max.
