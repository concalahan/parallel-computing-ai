It abandoned its survival horror roots in exchange for over-\nthe-top action, leaving behind everything that made it great in the first\nplace. That all changed with [Resident Evil\n7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/resident-evil-7), a glorious return\nto form that not only felt like classic Resi, but revolutionised it in some\nexciting ways.\n\nNow, a new vision of Resident Evil 2 is on the way using the same technology\nthat helped the seventh instalment shine. It looks fantastic and plays just\nand well, and you can read both of our hands-on previews below alongside\neverything you need to know about the Resident Evil 2 Remake. .\n\n**Related:[Best PS4 Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nps4-games)**\n\n## What is Resident Evil 2 Remake?\n\nFirst announced back in 2015, Resident Evil 2 Remake is intended as a modern\niteration of the 1998 release. Fans have been requesting the project for\nyears, and following the success of the original Resident Evil and Zero\nremasters, Capcom is finally listening.\n\n## Resident Evil 2 Remake release date\n\nThe remake was announced at [E3\n2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/e3-2018-2949170) for\n[PS4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/ps4-pro), [Xbox\nOne](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/xbox-one-s), and\n[PC](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/best-gaming-pc-2993099) and will be\nlaunching on January 25, 2019. That’s pretty soon, and we can’t wait.\n\nResident Evil 2 Remake Trailers\n\nTokyo Games Show 2018 has brought us a new trailer for Resident Evil 2 Remake,\nand this one focuses mainly on story. We see plenty of Leon and Claire before\nfinally being introduced to the remake’s rendition of Ada Wong. It also has us\ndesperately wanting a reboot of Dino Crisis in the RE Engine.\n\n  * \n\n## Resident Evil 2 Remake Claire Campaign Preview\n\nAfter years of waiting, Capcom is finally returning to its undead well and\nremaking what many consider to be Resident Evil’s finest chapter. Originally\nreleased for the PS1 in 1998, it’s not the easiest title to revisit with its\nclunky tank controls and blocky visuals. It’s as iconic as survival horror\ncomes, but fans who discovered the series with Resident Evil 4 or later\niterations might not agree with its archaic approach to scares.\n\nThis could all change with Resident Evil 2 Remake, a complete reimagining of\nthe second installment running on the same technology that powered [Resi\n7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/resident-evil-7). Playing through\ntwo individual campaigns as series’ veterans Leon S. Kennedy and Claire\nRedfield, you’ll scour the ruins of Raccoon City amidst a deadly zombie\noutbreak, uncovering the truth behind the devious Umbrella Corporation.\n\nHaving played through a tense yet brief demo as Claire Redfield, I’m\nincredibly eager to relive the horror with a modern coat of paint, even if the\nsection I played left a little to be desired.\n\n**Related:**[ **Upcoming PS4\nGames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/upcoming-ps4-games-3530401)\n\n![Resident Evil 2\nRemake](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nI was told by a Capcom representative prior to starting the demo that it\nfocused primarily on combat, while Leon’s virtual slice at E3 2018 was a way\nof exploring a small, isolated place with scares engineered to frighten the\nplayer. Knowing this, I began in a small office space littered with items and\nammunition ready to plunder. Immediately it felt like Resident Evil as I\ncombined items to make Acid Rounds and a few useful herb mixtures.\n\nAfter this, I jumped straight into the fire, which happened to be an\nunderground facility made up of claustrophobic corridors and rusty pipework\ngiving off a genuinely horrendous atmosphere. I quickly caught my bearings,\nkeenly aware of what felt like footsteps creeping around beside me. Following\na spooky bout of exploration I stumble upon Sherry Birkin, a young girl fans\nof the series will recognise.\n\nUnfortunately, she isn’t alone as I encounter one of the game’s most infamous\nfigures: William Birkin. Previously a virologist at Umbrella Corporation, he’s\nsuccumbed to the very virus he helped engineer. He’s morphed into a hideous,\noversized creature with a pus-filled eyeball on his right shoulder. This is,\nas you might have already guessed, his incredibly obvious weak point.\n\n**Related:**[ **Best Xbox One\nGames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/xbox-one-games-3435271)\n\n![Resident Evil 2\nRemake](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThis is where the demo’s frustrating boss battle begins, and it frankly isn’t\na strong section to showcase elements that helped the remake shine during our\nprevious time with it. Armed with a pistol, uzi and grenade launcher, my\nobjective was to avoid William Birkin for as long as possible, firing off\nshots until finally triggering a cutscene. There was little strategy to it,\nand Claire’s slow movement speed meant I often found myself stuck in corners\nwith no means of escape.\n\nGranted, rushing through the environment searching for resources as this\nunstoppable beast charged after me was tense, but it likely would have been\nserved better as a set piece instead of a tedious boss encounter. The shaky\nnature of Resi 2 Remake’s aiming mechanics convey the feeling that our heroes\nare legitimately terrified, desperate to escape the terrors they’ve found\nthemselves in. Knowing this makes the situation a tad easier to swallow.\n\nCombat feels great as every bullet lands with a satisfying thud, digging into\nthe flesh of Birkin. Sadly, I wasn’t able to witness the dynamic injury system\nwhere limbs react to each shot, which sounds like a clever implementation of\nstrategy, and a tonne of fun in its own right. There was nothing like this in\nthe demo, although things did improve nicely after getting Birkin off my tail.\nWith Sherry in tow, we returned to the surface seeking even a modicum of\nsafety.\n\nSpoiler: We didn’t find any. Seconds after emerging into an abandoned parking\ngarage Claire is held at gunpoint by a gross, elderly man. His identity\nunknown, the assailant kidnaps Sherry and leaves our heroine trapped. Swearing\nrevenge, the demo concludes with a dramatic cliffhanger that feels earnt and\nhighlights how the presentation soars past the original.\n\n**Related:**[ **Sekiro – Shadows Die Twice\nPreview**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/shadows-die-twice-release-date-\ngameplay-news-3370450)\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe voice acting is wonderful, building upon the high standard set by Resi 7\nwith cutscenes that mimic the standard you’d expect from a feature film.\nConsidering the franchise is renowned for its corny voice acting and mediocre\ndirection, it’s strange to see it excel above most of the competition. If this\nimpressive standard continues in the full experience, we could be looking at\none of the finest survival horror outings in recent years.\n\n## Updated Impressions\n\nResident Evil 2 Remake remains one of my most anticipated games of 2019, but\nmy time with Claire’s demo left me itching to explore and soak in the dank\nhorrors of Raccoon City. Instead, I was subjected to a frustrating boss fight\nthat didn’t play to the same strengths as our time with Leon’s otherwise\nfantastic campaign.\n\nThat aside, everything else we’ve seen not only sets a new standard for modern\nremakes, and could arguably set a benchmark for Capcom’s horror poster child,\nand we’ve only a few months left until its release.\n\n## Resident Evil 2 Remake Leon Campaign Preview\n\nAnyone who played Resident Evil growing up has the same story. Telling horror\nstories to our friends of hiding behind a blanket through fear of the next\nzombie-filled room, a control scheme that did everything to make things even\nmore terrifying. The trouble was if ever you tried showing someone unfamiliar\nwith the series what it was that petrified you, the tale got lost in\ntranslation because the thousands of words you painted became a picture of\npixels lost in a bygone era.\n\nFans, for what feels like the longest time, have been screaming for a Resident\nEvil 2 Remake, so much so that they took it upon themselves to make one\nseveral years ago before Capcom put a stop to it for reasons that have now\nbecome clear. Capcom’s new Resident Evil 2 is everything fans have ever wanted\nit to be, it has the potential to be the pinnacle of what the classic vision\nof the series could hope to become. Get ready to re-enter the world of\nsurvival horror in its truest form.\n\nThe brief gameplay demo at E3 2018 takes place in the police station, and it’s\nimmediately clear this isn’t just Resident Evil 2 with prettier graphics,\nalthough thanks to the RE Engine which powered [Resident Evil\n7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/resident-evil-7) it is utterly\ngorgeous. Capcom wants to make a Resident Evil 2 that plays with fan\nexpectations, therefore things will look familiar, but feel ever so slightly\ndifferent.\n\n**Related:[Shadow of the Tomb Raider\nReview](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider)**\n\n![resident evil 2\nremake](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe Licker, for instance, won’t appear as he did on the roof of the corridor.\nItems won’t be in the same place, and now, zombies will pop up in new places\nto keep you constantly terrified.\n\nAnd the game is incredibly scary. While Resi 2 lost its edge on account of\nmuscle memory for veterans, the 20 minutes I experienced were horrific. The\neast corridor of the station was almost pitch black without Leon’s torchlight,\nand Capcom’s amazing sound design meant every clang and crash had me spinning\naround looking for the source of the noise, petrified at what I might see.\n\nResident Evil 2 uses an over-the-shoulder camera similar to Resident Evil 4\nand 5, though it’s closer than those, making the experience feel even more\nvisceral. It offers a similar control scheme to both, too, but offers a much\ngreater fluidity to the tank controls that means moving around feels so much\nbetter both in and out of combat. Movement on the left stick is very smooth,\nfeels faster and allows you to walk even while bringing up Leon’s gun. Aiming\nis also quicker, which can be a blessing and a curse. When in a frantic panic,\ntrying to get that headshot while petrified of the rapidly approaching zombie\ncan be very tough.\n\nThe game is also incredibly violent, blood is all over the precinct, and every\nbullet that hits a zombie sees an incredible amount of splatter. The zombies\ntoo are immensely detailed, the best I’ve ever seen in the series and probably\nthe best zombies I’ve seen in any game. They are genuinely scary to look at,\nas their jaws draw for a chomp on Leon’s neck, it’s wince-worthy.\n\nCapcom has also done some amazing things with the camera during encounters. As\na zombie grabs hold of Leon, the camera swoops in even closer to get you even\ncloser to the bite. I frantically smashed every button possible trying to\navoid the chew, but you’re powerless to stop the bite, it’s purely to show\nevery gory detail. It’s as amazing as it is gruesome. After the bite, blood\nwill also stay on Leon’s neck after the zombie falls back. And as Leon is\nbeing bitten, his health box will pop up in the lower left to show the extent\nof the damage. It’s all done to keep you in the action and not forced to jump\ninto a pause menu to see how much damage each bite deals.\n\n**Related:[Marvel’s Spider-Man\nReview](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/spider-man-ps4)**\n\n![resident evil 2\nremake](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## First Impressions\n\nI, along with every other Resi fan, have waited the best part of 20 years for\na remake of Resident Evil 2, and I don’t think any of us could have expected\nsomething this good. The incredible visuals, pitch-perfect controls and a\nwonderful balance between familiarity and reinvention mean this is a game that\nneeds to be marked in everyone’s calendar as the one to watch.\n\nMaybe watch it from behind some comfy cushions, though.\n\n_**Are you excited for Resident Evil 2 Remake?
