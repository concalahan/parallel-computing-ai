Here’s what they all mean and everything else you need\nto know before buying one.**\n\nBelow is the entire Sony Bravia TV line up for 2018. The most exciting models\nhere are the [Sony AF8 OLED](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sony-\naf8-oled-a8f) and [Sony XF90 /\nX900F](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sony-xf90) – but it’s worth\nchecking out the rest of the range.\n\nWhile you’re at it, why not check out everything from the other brands?\n\n  * **[Panasonic’s 2018 4K HDR and HD TV lineup explained  \n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/panasonic-tvs-2018-4k-hdr-\noled-2952995)**\n\n  * [**Samsung QLED TVs 2018: Every new Samsung 4K TV explained**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/new-samsung-2018-tv-models-qled-specs-price-release-date-3367473)\n  * **[Philips TVs 2018: Every new OLED, LCD, 4K and HD model explained](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/philips-tvs-2018-2949029)**\n  * [**LG’s 2018 OLED and LCD TVs – now with prices**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/new-lg-2018-oled-tv-models-specs-price-release-date-3367924)\n\nBefore getting into the Sony details, know that almost all of the range will\noffer [HDR](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/hdr-tv-high-dynamic-\ntelevision-explained). Even non-4K ones. They will support HDR10 out of the\nbox, and the top models (ZD9, A1, AF8, XF90) have received Dolby Vision via an\nonline software update.\n\nSo now everyone can have HDR, an undeniably more impactful development than\n4K, without necessarily shelling out for an expensive model. Sony did this in\n2017 – as far as I know, they were the only manufacturer to do so. It’s a\nbrilliant move, especially for gamers who have a HDR-toting [PS4\nSlim](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/playstation-4) but not the 4K\n[PS4 Pro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/ps4-pro).\n\nSpeaking of HDR, all of Sony’s 2018 (and 2017) TVs handle [Hybrid Log-\nGamma](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/hybrid-log-gamma-what-is-it)\n(HLG). HLG content is still thin on the ground right now, but the BBC is\nstepping up its iPlayer trials and Sky Q will support HDR next year.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nAlso, 3D has flown the coop. Sony made a point of saying none of its 2017\nmodels supported 3D, and in 2018 there’s been no mention of it.\n\nWith that out of the way, let’s look at some 2018 TVs.\n\n**Related:[Best 4K TV](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-4k-tvs_round-up)**\n\n## **Sony Bravia 2018 TVs – Ultra HD / 4K models**\n\n![Sony KD-65ZD9\n1](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\n**Sony ZD9 (Z9D in the US) – 65, 75 and 100 inches**\n\n  * Sony KD-65ZD9 / XBR-65Z9D\n  * Sony KD-75ZD9 / XBR-75Z9D\n  * Sony KD-100ZD9 / XBR-100Z9D\n\nThis is technically not a 2018 model. It was released late into 2016 and in\n2018 it maintains its position as Sony’s flagship LCD model. That’s because\nit’s a stunner. It’s one of the few LCD models out there that uses full-array\nlocal dimming, which means much better lighting precision and uniformity over\nthe common edge-lit LCDs.\n\nA successor has been announced in the form of the ZF9. You can read more about\n[that model over here](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/sony-zf9-vs-\nsamsung-q9fn-3527002).\n\n**Our review:[Sony KD-65ZD9BU](https://www.trustedreviews.com/sony-\nkd65zd9-review)**\n\n**Sony A1 OLED (A1E in the US) – 55, 65 and 77 inches**\n\n  * Sony KD-55A1 / XBR-55A1E\n  * Sony KD-65A1 / XBR-65A1E\n  * Sony-KD77A1 / XBR-77A1E\n\nNot only is this Sony’s first 4K OLED TV – it doesn’t have any speakers in the\nconventional sense. Instead inside is some fancy tech that shakes the screen\nto make sound. It has to be seen and heard to be believed. This was one of the\nbest TVs in 2017, so it’s great that Sony has kept it in circulation for 2018.\n\n**Our review:[Sony A1\nOLED](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sony-a1-oled)**\n\n**Sony AF8 OLED (Sony A8F in the US) – 55 and 65 inches**\n\n  * Sony KD-55AF8 / Sony XBR-55A8F\n  * Sony KD-65AF8 / Sony XBR-65A8F\n\nThis was the first Sony TV to be introduced in 2018, although technically\nspeaking it’s not entirely new. That’s because it’s a sort of remake of the\namazing [A1 OLED](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sony-a1-oled).\n\nNot everyone loved the A-frame and 5-degree lean on the A1, so Sony made an\nalternative with a regular plinth, and it stands upright. Technically there’s\nstill a minor tilt for safety reasons, but now it’s no more than 2 degrees.\nEither way, not having a big, folded stand at the back means it’s easier to\nwall-mount, if that’s what you’re after.\n\nPicture and sound quality is identical to the A1 – the key difference is in\nthe design. As far as I can tell, the only reason this model sits ‘below’ the\nA1 in the Sony Bravia hierarchy is that it ships with a rubber remote, versus\nthe A1’s aluminium and rubber one. Oh, and there’s not been any word on a\n77-inch AF8 yet.\n\nWhy is Sony releasing a remake, as opposed to a totally new OLED in 2018? Well\nthe Sony A1 has been hugely popular, so it makes sense to do the same thing\nand cater to a slightly wider audience. That approach has the advantage of\nlower prices – the Sony KD-55AF8 is available at £2499 (or €2949), while the\nSony KD-65AF8 costs £3299 (or €3899).\n\n**Our review:[Sony AF8 OLED](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sony-\naf8-oled-a8f)**\n\n**See the latest Sony Bravia deals\nat[Very](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3090&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-\nverycampaign&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.very.co.uk%2Felectricals%2Fsony%2Ftelevisions%2Fe%2Fb%2F176%2C4740.end),\n[John\nLewis](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1203&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnlewis.com%2Fbrowse%2Felectricals%2Ftelevisions%2Fview-\nall-tvs%2Fsony%2F_%2FN-6srfZ1z140ar%3F) and\n[Currys](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1599&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-\ntv&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fgbuk%2Fsony-tv-and-home-\nentertainment%2Ftelevisions%2Ftelevisions%2F301_3002_30002_49_xx%2Fxx-\ncriteria.html%3F). **\n\n**Our review:[Sony KD-55AF8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sony-\nkd-55af8) (55-inch version)**\n\n![Sony\nXF90](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Sony XF90 (Sony X900F in the US) – 49, 55, 65 and 75 inches**\n\n  * Sony KD-49XF9005 / Sony XBR-49X900F\n  * Sony KD-55XF9005 / Sony XBR-55X900F\n  * Sony KD-65XF9005 / Sony XBR-65X900F\n  * Sony KD-75XF9005 / Sony XBR-75X900F\n\nNow this is a curious one. As OLED TVs are taking up more of the ‘premium’\nslots, LCD TVs are sliding towards the mid-range. That seems to be everyone’s\nstrategy in 2018. But that doesn’t mean LCDs are getting worse – in fact, Sony\nis bringing its top tech down the range.\n\nThe XF90 is the spiritual successor to 2017’s XE90, as well as the XE93 and\nXE94. Essentially, it’s a lot of higher-end tech crammed into a model that\nwon’t cost the earth. It’s the only full-array local dimming model in 2018. It\nuses the same X1 Extreme processor found in the ZD9, A1 and AF8, and it’s a\n100Hz panel too. It runs on Nougat, the latest version of Android TV, and\nthere’s built-in Youview too. And since it uses the same chip as the higher-up\nmodels, it supports Dolby Vision too.\n\n**Reviews:[Sony KD-65XF9005](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sony-\nkd-65xf9005) / [Sony KD-55XF9005](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sony-\nkd-55xf9005)**\n\n**Get £30 off all TVs 55 inches or above with code[TRUSTED30TV at ao.com.\nOrder now and get it delivered\ntomorrow.](https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101l3qRc/pubref:tr_tv30off/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fao.com%2Fl%2Ftvs-55_inches_and_above%2F1-91%2F107-108%2F)**\n\n![Sony\nXF85](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Sony XF85 (Sony X850F) – 43, 49, 55, 65, 75, and 85 inches**\n\n  * Sony KD-43XF85 / Sony XBR-43X850F\n  * Sony KD-49XF85 / Sony XBR-49X850F\n  * Sony KD-55XF85 / Sony XBR-55X850F\n  * Sony KD-65XF85 / Sony XBR-65X850F\n  * Sony KD-75XF85 / Sony XBR-75X850F\n  * Sony KD-85XF85 / Sony XBR-85X850F\n\nThis is the LCD model Sony expects to sell the most, in part because it comes\nin the most sizes: 43, 49, 55, 65, 75 and 85 inches. The entire range benefits\nfrom a 100Hz panel, so you’ll have good motion no matter which size you go\nfor.\n\nMost of these will be edge-lit. The 85-inch version will be direct-lit, since\nedge lighting gets worse the bigger the TV – but it will not have the full-\narray local dimming of the XF90. We also lose the XF90’s superior X1 Extreme\nprocessor.\n\nOh, the aluminium chassis comes in two colours: silver for the smaller four\nsizes, black for the two larger ones.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems this model doesn’t do a great job handling high\ndynamic range. Read our review below to find out why.\n\n**Read our review:[Sony XF85](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sony-\nxf85)**\n\n![Sony\nXF80](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Sony XF80 (Sony X800F) – 43, 49 and 55 inches**\n\n  * Sony KD-43XF8096 / Sony XBR-43X800F\n  * Sony KD-49XF8096 / Sony XBR-43X800F\n  * Sony KD-55XF8096 / Sony XBR-43X800F\n\nThis is what you get if you take away the XF85’s aluminium chassis, and swap\nthe 100Hz panel for a 50Hz one. The build quality isn’t as nice, and motion\nisn’t as good. If you’re not fussed about those things, this is a more\naffordable way to get Android TV and a Triluminos picture (Sony’s term for a\nlarger colour palette not available on lower models).\n\n_**Related:[What is UHD\nPremium?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/ultra-hd-premium)**_\n\n**See the latest Sony Bravia deals\nat[Very](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3090&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-\nverycampaign&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.very.co.uk%2Felectricals%2Fsony%2Ftelevisions%2Fe%2Fb%2F176%2C4740.end),\n[John\nLewis](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1203&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnlewis.com%2Fbrowse%2Felectricals%2Ftelevisions%2Fview-\nall-tvs%2Fsony%2F_%2FN-6srfZ1z140ar%3F) and\n[Currys](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1599&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-\ntv&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fgbuk%2Fsony-tv-and-home-\nentertainment%2Ftelevisions%2Ftelevisions%2F301_3002_30002_49_xx%2Fxx-\ncriteria.html%3F). **\n\n## Sony Bravia 2018 TVs – Full HD and HD-ready models\n\nLooking for smaller, cheaper TVs for the bedroom? Then you might want to\nconsider a cheaper, smaller model in 1080p or 720p. Sony hasn’t officially\nunveiled any new basic models for 2018 so far, but they’ve confirmed the WE6\nand RE4 from 2017 will continue to be sold.\n\n  * Sony WE66 – 40 and 49 inches\n  * Sony WE61 – 32 inches\n  * Sony RE4 – 32 and 40 inches\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Sony WE66, WE61** : The WE6 series is a bit of an odd one. It’s divided into\nWE66 and WE61. Basically the WE66 describes the 49 and 40 inch models, which\nare Full HD at 1080p. The WE61 is 32 inches and is HD ready.\n\nThis series maintains the smart functionality (and HDR streaming capabilities)\nbut loses out on the Triluminos display.\n\n**Sony RE4** : I never thought I’d see a no-frills TV feature HDR, but here it\nis. The RE4 is a straight-up HD TV with no internet or streaming capabilities.\nBut it does play nicely with your PS4’s HDR games.\n\n_And that’s it for the Sony 2018 models we know about so far.
