The obscenely stylish JRPG was met with critical acclaim\nfrom fans and critics alike. Rightfully so, as Atlus had managed to produce\none of the [best RPGs](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-rpg-games) of\nthis generation with lovable characters, an engrossing story and ludicrous\namounts of depth behind its many systems.\n\nWhile it’s still a long way off, we’re already excited about the prospect of\nPersona 6 and what it might bring to the table. **_Trusted Reviews_** has\ncompiled everything you need to know alongside all the latest news, rumours\nand our very own wishlist.\n\n**Related:[Monster Hunter\nWorld](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/monster-hunter-world)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Persona 6 news – what’s being said about it?\n\nAtlus recently released a [Japanese survey](http://p-ch.jp/enquete2018/)\nasking fans questions regarding a variety of different properties. More\nimportantly, it asked whether fans would like to see future titles and\npotential Persona remakes released on\n[PC](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-pc-games) alongside consoles.\n\nThis means Atlus is already exploring the series’ next entry or a fully-\nfledged remake and is considering the idea of expanding beyond its\npredominantly PlayStation identity.\n\n## Persona 6 release date – when is it coming out?\n\nThe existence of Persona 6 is yet to be acknowledged by Atlus, so we likely\nwon’t hear much regarding a release date for a good while.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\n**Related:**[ **Upcoming PS4\nGames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/upcoming-ps4-games)\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Persona 6 wishlist – what we’d love to see\n\n**Far less hand holding**\n\nEven by JRPG standards, Persona 5 was an incredibly long game. You could lose\nhundreds of hours simply beating the main story and leaving side missions by\nthe wayside. Knowing this, it’s unfortunate that the fifth installment seemed\nfascinated at stopping the player repeatedly for unskippable repeating\ndialogue and unusual scene transitions that felt detrimental to the overall\nexperience.\n\nIt made the pacing feel oddly abrupt and irritating at points, knowing you’d\nhave to grind through 20 minutes of tedium before finally being set free on\nthe alluring streets of Tokyo. We’re unsure that Persona would benefit from\ngoing open-world, but providing us with more freedom in regards to how we\noperate would be much appreciated.\n\n**Deeper, more consequential social links**\n\nWe really grew to love Persona 5’s cast. They were deep, nuanced and\npositively oozing with style. Social Links allowed us to make lifelong\nfriends, fall in love and help those close to us through a series of unusual\npredicaments. They were excellent fun, although seldom had a lasting impact on\nthe core narrative.\n\nIt’d be intriguing to see the central cast’s array of social links\nincorporated into the main plot in some fashion. Perhaps a romantic interest\nwill influence how party dynamics could work in the later hours or provide you\nwith additional cutscenes that would otherwise remain hidden. We see it as a\nway of adding depth to an already excellent system.\n\n**Related:[Dissidia Final Fantasy\nNT](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/dissidia-final-fantasy-nt)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**A return to the country**\n\nThe town of Inaba in Persona 4 is one we’ll always have fond memories of.\nJunes, Tatsuhime Shrine and Samegawa Flood Plain are places we won’t be\nforgetting anytime soon, and we’d love for Persona 6 to have a similar lasting\nimpression. Perhaps this is something that might be achieved with a return to\nthe countryside?\n\nPersona 5’s vision of Tokyo was an enthralling one, but it felt somewhat\nconfined considering the entire city was out there and we only had access to a\nselect few locations. Atlus could either return us to a distinctive setting or\nperhaps splice the neon-lit streets of Tokyo together with a quaint country\nvillage.\n\n**Dual protagonists**\n\nA common complaint regarding Persona 5 was the lack of a customizable\nprotagonist and the inability to select a gender like in past games. We\nbelieve both these problems could not only be solved but even lead to\ninnovation with dual protagonists running the show.\n\nThe hustle and bustle of Tokyo wonderfully juxtaposed with the peaceful\ninhabitants of Inaba would make for a truly unique RPG we’d love to\nexperience. Shifting between two expansive locations each with their own\ndynamics would make every play session a welcome surprise if executed well\nenough.\n\n**Related:**[ **Sea of Thieves\nPreview**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sea-of-thieves)\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**A more progressive cast of characters**\n\nIt’s unfortunate that Persona has a relatively mediocre track record when it\ncomes to presenting LGBT characters. They’re often used as a punchline to a\njoke or depicted in a way that oftentimes feels derogatory. Kanji Tatsumi’s\nsexuality was joked about in Persona 4 despite being an important trait of his\npersonality and Persona 5 introduces side-characters that are little more than\noffensive caricatures.\n\nBeing gay, transgender or any type of orientation shouldn’t be what defines a\ncharacter, especially if its presented in a way that’s either cliched or\ncauses offence to those people. We want Persona 6 to embrace inclusivity with\nstories that mean something and don’t treat its cast like personified gags. An\nimprovement here would not only make its heroes more relatable but make the\nplayer feel more engrossed and accepted.\n\nPersona has always been out rising above adversity and being accepted for who\nyou are despite your faults, a lesson it passionately preaches but could also\nlearn from itself.\n\n**_What’s on your wishlist for Persona 6?
