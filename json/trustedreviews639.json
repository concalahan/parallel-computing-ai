Multiple\nusers began noticing the display anomaly over the weekend, with many posting\nthe hilarious flaw to Twitter.\n\nGoogle has already acknowledged the issue, so this isn’t the act of a\nphotoshop prankster. The company told [Android\nPolice](https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/29/hilarious-pixel-3-xl-bug-\nadds-second-notch-side-screen/) a fix for the problem is coming soon. If\nyou’re experiencing the double-barrelled notch, those affected have been able\nto resolve the issue by restarting the phone.\n\n> So my Pixel randomly grew another notch today. 😂 <https://t.co/c6Pff9MVmW>\n[pic.twitter.com/ugjfLmCkDZ](https://t.co/ugjfLmCkDZ)\n\n>\n\n> — UrAvgConsumer (@UrAvgConsumer) [October 24,\n2018](https://twitter.com/UrAvgConsumer/status/1055215243637460992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n**Related:[Pixel 3 vs Pixel 3\nXL](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/pixel-3-vs-pixel-3-xl-3601343)**\n\nThe pair of notches isn’t the only strange issue to befall Pixel 3 XL users.\nLast week, the influential YouTuber Marques Brownlee [posted an image of his\nhandset](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/pixel-3-xl-dead-display-3610425)\nwith a line or bright pink dead pixels right down the middle.\n\nHe later revealed the appearance may have been the result of a “small pocket-\nslip drop” that happened a week previously, but no official cause has been\nattributed to the problem.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n> I’m not about to make an entire video, but RIP this Pixel 3 XL.

That might\nbe the case, but the end result is largely rubbish-sounding audio quality.\n\nThe company is also dealing with complaints from users over [slow charging\nspeeds](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-pixel-3-wireless-charging-\nproblem-3609647) when using third-party wireless chargers. The Pixel Stand is\nthe only charger capable of wirelessly charging the Pixel 3 phones at the\nadvertising speeds of 10W, meaning pads from the likes of Anker are only\ncapable of 5W charging.\n\n**Have you had any issues since grabbing a Pixel 3 or Pixel 3 XL?
