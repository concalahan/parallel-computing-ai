Apple says this ensures the\nApple Pencil 2 is always charged and ready to go. A new graphic at the top of\nthe display will also indicate the charge level. Previously, the Apple Pencil\nhas been charged via a lightning cable or the charging adapter that shipped\nwith the original.\n\n**Related:[Best MacBook 2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nmacbook-3527944)**\n\nThe company is also improving functionality. Tapping the iPad Pro screen with\nthe new Pencil will automatically launch the Notes app. Once working within an\napp, iPad Pro users will be able to tap the Pencil twice to switch modes from\nthe selected writing tool to the eraser. Apple says this feature is\ncustomisable, with users able to map the gesture depending on the app they’re\nusing.\n\nIn terms of the design there’s now one flat side, like an actual Pencil, to\nstop it rolling off the table. The company has also ditched the detachable cap\nfor a more simplified look.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### The Blackout Club’s tutorial is terrifying – even for Halloween….\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/gaming/the-blackout-clubs-tutorial-is-\nterrifying-halloween-horror-3613197 \"The Blackout Club’s tutorial is\nterrifying – even for Halloween….\")\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Battlefield 1 headlines Xbox Games With Gold for November 2018\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/xbox-games-gold-november-2018-3613188\n\"Battlefield 1 headlines Xbox Games With Gold for November 2018\")\n\n  *   * [ ![new ipad pro 2018 models](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### New iPad Pro 2018: Apple launches 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPads with ‘Xbox\nlevel’ graphics\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ipad-pro-2018-release-date-specs-\nprice-3482812 \"New iPad Pro 2018: Apple launches 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPads\nwith ‘Xbox level’ graphics\")\n\n  * \n\nThe new Apple Pencil 2 will will be available alongside the new iPad Pro,\nwhich is available to pre-order from today. It starts at $799/£769 for the\n11-inch model. The new Apple Pencil will be more expensive than its\npredecessor. It’s $129/£119 compared to the $99/£89 Apple asked for the\noriginal.\n\nUnfortunately, the first generation Apple Pencil won’t work with the new iPad\nPro, and the Apple Pencil 2 won’t work with older iPad Pro models.\n\nThe new tablet offers Face ID, the most powerful Apple processor ever making\nit powerful enough for real, full-fat photoshop. Apple has ditched the Home\nbutton and replaced Lightning with USB-C, making it easier to connect to\ndevices like cameras, phones, external displays and much, much more.\n\n**Will you be buying the new Apple iPad Pro when it goes on sale on November\n7?
