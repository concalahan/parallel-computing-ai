These new versions of the iPad Pro\nwill be sold alongside the\n[iPad](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/ipad-2018) which remains Apple’s\nentry-level tablet.\n\nThe Apple iPad’s price starts at £319, whereas the [iPad Pro\n2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ipad-pro-2018-release-date-specs-\nprice-3482812) costs £769 for the 11-inch model and £969 for the 12.9-inch\nmodel. That’s a big price difference – but what exactly do you get for your\nmoney?\n\n![Apple iPad keyboard\nfolio](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## **iPad Pro (2018) vs iPad – Display and specs**\n\nThe iPad Pro is targeted, as the name suggests, at ‘professionals’. There’s a\nbig focus on the screen and the power of the internal components.\n\nThe iPad Pro (2018) comes in both 11-inch and 12.9-inch sizes, with the iPad\nonly boasting a 9.7-inch option.\n\nIt’s not just the size that’s different, it also comes down to the quality of\nthe panel. The iPad Pros feature 120Hz refresh rates for smoother navigation,\nsupport for the wide P3 colour gamut and a ppi (pixels per inch) of 264. They\nalso have a much thinner bezel with curved edges.\n\n**Related:[Best tablets](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-tablets)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThe iPad, on the other hand, has a more standard 60Hz refresh and no support\nfor P3. It does have the same 264ppi, though.\n\nPowering the iPad Pro (2018) is the A12X Bionic chipset, an upgraded version\nof the SoC you’ll find in the new [iPhone\nXS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xs) and [iPhone\nXR](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xr). Where the iPad version\ndiffers from its phone counterpart is in the graphics chip, which, Apple said,\nputs the iPad on a similar level to an [Xbox One\nS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/xbox-one-s) console.\n\nThis brand-new, super fast is a big improvement both in processing and\ngraphics when compared to the A10 chip inside the iPad. If you’re really\nlooking for extra oomph and for games and apps to run as well as possible,\nyou’re better off looking at the iPad Pro.\n\nYou’ll get better audio from the iPad Pro too, thanks to the quad-speaker\narray situated around the device. The iPad instead uses two speakers on the\nbottom to produce sound. One notable missing feature on the 2018 iPad Pros is\na headphone jack, something you will find on the cheaper iPad.\n\nIn terms of battery life it’s hard to really gauge how the two devices will\ncompare yet. Apple claims both will last ‘all-day’ but we’ll need to spend\ntime with the new iPad Pro to see what that means with proper usage.\n\n## **![9.7-inch iPad\n2018](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)iPad Pro (2018) vs iPad – Design and accessories**\n\nThe 2018 iPad Pro is the first real change to how iPads look in a long time.\nIt looks very much like the [iPhone\nSE](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-se), with flat sides and\nrounded corners, We haven’t held the device yet, but it looks very slick in\npictures. It ditches Lightning for USB-C and includes lots of magnets around\nthe front and back to connect the [Apple Pencil\n2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-pencil-2-2018-features-3612981)\nand Folio Smart Keyboard.\n\nThere’s no Touch ID fingerprint sensing home button on the new iPad Pro\n(2018). Instead it’s unlocked via Face ID and controlled by a gesture-based\nUI. If you’ve used an [iPhone\nX](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-x) or newer then you’ll feel\nright at home.\n\nThe non-Pro iPad looks is a bit more curvy, with softer lines and and a\nthicker bezel surrounding the screen. You’ve got the home button, headphone\njack and Lightning connector for charging and syncing.\n\nWhat has always set the iPad Pro apart from the other iPad is the selection of\nApple-made accessories. For the iPad Pro you can get the Apple Pencil 2 and a\nFolio Smart Keyboard.\n\nApple Pencil 2 connects and charges wirelessly and lets you draw directly onto\nthe display. We loved Apple Pencil 1 so it’ll be interesting to see how this\ncompares.\n\nThe Smart Keyboard Cover also attaches via magnets and turns the iPad Pro into\nsomething more akin to a laptop. You can find keyboard cases for the iPad, but\nnone connect as simply and most require charging.\n\n## **iPad Pro (2018) vs iPad – What’s the difference in price?**\n\nApple’s iPad starts at £319 for the 32GB model and £409 for the 128GB. If you\nwant LTE/4G support you’ll need to pay £449 for 32GB and £539 for 128GB.\n\nThe iPad Pro (2018) costs £769 for the 11-inch model, that’s for 64GB. The\nnext capacity bump is 256GB for £919, then 512GB for £1019 and finally 1TB for\n£1519.
