We’ll be publishing our review\nshortly._\n\n**_OPINION: Ryan Jones won’t deny that the Intel Core i9-9900K processor, is a\nworld-beating powerhouse, but heat issues might make you reconsider an\nupgrade._**\n\nYou might be wondering where Trusted Reviews’ review for the Intel Core\ni9-9900K is. I’ve had the new CPU in the office for about a week now, but\nunfortunately, I’m yet to complete the benchmark tests because of some\npotential overheating issues.  \n  \nThis isn’t due to any flaw in the processor’s design. It’s simply because the\ni9-9900K’s performance power is so significant that it requires a monster of a\ncooler to keep it from getting unbearably toasty.\n\nI was initially using the Corsair H60 liquid cooler for Trusted Reviews’\ntesting rig. It’s done a fine job previously, whether it was cooling the\n[Intel Core i7-8700K](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/intel-\ncore-i7-8700k) or [AMD’s Ryzen 7\n2700X](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/amd-ryzen-7-2700x-2). Boot up\nthe rig with the i9-9900K installed though, and the Corsair H60 is helpless in\npreventing a system crash.\n\nFortunately, I had a more powerful cooler: the Corsair Hydro Series H100i v2\nExtreme Performance Liquid CPU Cooler. Boasting two 140mm fans that can run a\nmax speed of 2400rpm, I thought this would do the trick. Sadly not.\n\nThe H100i did offer better results than the Corsair H60, mind. The test rig\nwouldn’t crash after a couple of minutes, but the performance results from\nCinebench seemed lower than expected.\n\nUnder investigation, when I ran the single-core Cinebench test the i9-9900K\nwould use Intel Turbo Boost to increase the processor’s clock speed to the\nmaximum 5GHz. Running the multi-core Cinebench tests, which pushes all eight\ncores to 100% utilisation, the processor stuck to its base clock speed of\n3.60GHz and the benchmark scores weren’t as impressive.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAccording to Intel ([https://www.intel.co.uk/content/www/uk/en/architecture-\nand-technology/turbo-boost/turbo-boost-\ntechnology.html](https://www.intel.co.uk/content/www/uk/en/architecture-and-\ntechnology/turbo-boost/turbo-boost-technology.html)), Turbo Boost Technology\n“may not achieve maximum turbo frequencies when running heavy workloads and\nusing multiple cores concurrently”. The factors used to work out if to use\nTurbo Boost include the type of workload, number of active cores, estimated\ncurrent consumption, estimated power consumption and processor temperature.\n\nGiven that the system crashed when using a less-powerful cooler, heat could be\nan issue here. Using the UEFI BIOS to adjust the clock speeds to 5GHz CPU\ntemperatures would shoot up to around 75°C before leading to yet another\nsystem crash.\n\nRealistically, when maxing out all cores, the i9-9900K is unlikely to Turbo\nBoost to the maximum 5GHz, although we would expect to see some kind of boost\non the cores. We’ve contacted Intel about our initial issues, but have not\nreceived any information on how to prevent the system crashes.\n\n**Related:[Best CPU for gaming](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-cpu-\nfor-gaming)**\n\n## **Intel Core i9-9900K – Time for a new cooler**\n\nThere’s one easy solution to all of these problems – buy a better cooler. Our\nnew one will be arriving early next week, which should hopefully put a stop to\nthose system crashes and let me finally finish the Intel Core i9-9900K review.\n\nSo why am I writing this piece? Rather than just venting like some angsty teen\nwould in their diary, I’m publishing this article as a precaution to potential\ni9-9900K buyers, as there’s a chance their coolers won’t be powerful enough to\nget the most out of this chip.\n\n![Intel Core\ni9-9900K](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe Corsair H60 and Corsair Hydro Series H100i v2 liquid CPU coolers that we\nused aren’t exactly outdated gadgets. As I said, they’re both fully capable of\ncoping with the heat that most other processors generate, so it’s unlikely\nthat most consumers would have bothered buying anything more powerful prior to\nthe i9-9900K’s release.  \n  \nOf course, prospective i9-9900K owners could just go and buy another cooler,\nbut those things don’t come cheap. If we assume that Corsair’s top-of-the-\nrange liquid cooler is capable of preventing the i9-9900k from overheating,\nthat’s an extra £165 outlay on top of the £600 CPU. That’s a lot of money for\na processor upgrade.\n\nThat said, if the i9-9900K is truly the “world’s best gaming desktop\nprocessor” as Intel claims, then maybe that investment is worth it. We’ll be\nable to say for sure once our final review is published next week.\n\nBut while I wasn’t able to complete all of the benchmark tests, I did get a\nsneak peak of what Intel’s new flagship CPU has to offer.\n\n**Related:[Best Intel processor](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nintel-processor-3517396)**\n\n## **Intel Core i9-9900K benchmark results**\n\nAfter manually setting the i9-9900K’s performance to its boosted clock speed\nof 4.7GHz (I didn’t set it to the optimum 5GHz boosted clock speed in order to\nreduce the risk of overheating) I was able to run a few benchmark tests.\n\nBefore I get to my results though, here’s the build of our test rig so you\nknow exactly which components I used:\n\n  * Motherboard: Asus Maximus XI Hero (Wi-Fi)\n  * Processor: Intel Core i9-9900K (set to 4.7GHz)\n  * RAM: [Corsair Vengeance 2666MHz](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-ddr4-ram), 16GB DDR4\n  * Cooler: Corsair Hydro Series H100i PRO liquid cooler\n  * PSU: [Corsair CX750M](https://www.corsair.com/us/en/Power/cxm-series-2015-config/p/CP-9020061-NA)\n  * SSD: [Samsung 850 EVO](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-850-evo-250gb)\n  * OS: [Windows 10 Pro 64-bit](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/windows-10)\n\n**Cinebench R15**\n\nFirst off, I used the benchmark programme Cinebench R15. For the single-core\ntest, the i9-9900K achieved a score of 216cb, while the multi-core result came\nin at a hugely impressive 2141cb. Those are the highest scores we’ve ever seen\nin a Cinebench R15 benchmark test.\n\nI’ve included a bar chart below to show a comparison of the i9-9900K’s\nperformance compared to other processors. Be mindful though, we tested the\nother CPUs with a different test rig, which could affect the final results.\n\n![Intel Core\ni9-9900K](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe components used in the test rig that benchmarked the other CPUs is listed\nbelow:\n\n  * Motherboard: Asus Strix X470-F Gaming (for AMD CPUs) / Asus TUF Z370-Pro Gaming (for Intel CPUs)\n  * RAM: Corsair Vengeance RGB 3000MHz \n  * GPU: Zotac Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Ti \n  * Cooler: NZXT X52 cooler\n  * PSU: Corsair RM750i\n  * SSD: [Samsung 860 EVO](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-850-evo-250gb)\n  * OS: [Windows 10 Pro 64-bit](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/windows-10)\n\nOnce we’ve finished our final benchmarks, we will retest all the other CPUs in\nthe same rig as the i9-9900K to make it a fairer comparison. But for now, the\nresults above still show a remarkable performance for Intel’s new processor\n\n**Ghost Recon Wildlands**\n\nSince Intel claims the i9-9900K is “the world’s best gaming desktop processor”\nit made sense for me to check out how much of an improvement the CPU had on\nframe rates. We used the same rig for the benchmarks of the i9-9900K and\ni7-8700K, using the Nvidia RTX 2080 Ti as the GPU.\n\nThe Ghost Recon Wildlands benchmark results below show that the i9-9900K\ndefinitely sees an improvement to frame rates, albeit nothing noticeably\nsubstantial. Interestingly, HD content seemed to benefit more than 4K. Saying\nthat, there isn’t enough data here to make a final judgement on the i9-9900K’s\ngaming performance.  \n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nWe wanted to test Shadow of the Tomb Raider too, but it was so intensive that\nit repeatedly caused the i9-9900K to crash. Once we’ve got the new cooler in,\nwe’ll be sure to add Shadow of the Tomb Raider’s benchmark results.\n\n**Are you going to get the new Intel Core i9-9900K?
