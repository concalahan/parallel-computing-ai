One of these will be a 3D\ncamera.\n\nWhy this will be deemed necessary isn’t made clear, but it’s worth remembering\nthat Google is currently working on [Project\nTango](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/project-tango-tablet-developer-kit-\nlaunched), an advanced mobile camera that can map 3D space.\n\nThe report also claims that Google and LG will turn to Qualcomm and its\n[Snapdragon\n810](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/snapdragon-810-features) CPU to\npower this new Nexus, despite recent concerns over its performance and\nexcessive heat generation.\n\n**Related:**[ **Best Android Smartphones 2015**  \n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-android-phones-1_round-up)  \nWe can also expect any new Nexus phone to come with a fingerprint sensor and a\nUSB-C port, as both are supported in early Android M developer builds.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nBesides this LG smartphone, it’s also been heavily rumoured that\n[Huawei](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/huawei-nexus-leak-renews-hope-\nfor-google-s-next-smartphone) will provide a direct phablet follow-up to the\n[Nexus 6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/nexus-6-review).\n\n"}
