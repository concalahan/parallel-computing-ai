And now, it’s finally coming to fruition with Halo Infinite. Revealed\nat [E3 2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/e3-2018-2949170) with a\nfrankly stunning trailer, little else is known about the upcoming entry beyond\nthat it is essentially Halo 6 in all but name.\n\n_Trusted Reviews_ has compiled everything you need to know about Halo Infinite\nincluding all the latest news, release date, gameplay, trailers and more.\n\n## What is Halo Infinite – is it Halo 6?\n\nOnce again developed by 343 Industries, Halo Infinite is an upcoming first-\nperson shooter in Microsoft’s hugely popular franchise. Following in the\nfootsteps of Halo 5: Guardians, 343’s Jeff Easterling has confirmed (via\n[Gamespot](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinite-is-halo-6-not-a-\nprequel-microsoft-sa/1100-6461198/)) that “you should just consider it Halo 6.\nDon’t think of it as a weird prequel kind of thing. It’s the next story. It’s\nthe next chapter in what is going on.”\n\nSo, there you have it. Infinite may not have a number in the title, but it is\ndefinitely the next chapter in Master Chief’s story and, hopefully, a\nconclusion to The Forerunner Trilogy.\n\n**Related:[Upcoming Xbox One\nGames](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/upcoming-xbox-one-\ngames-2018-3531040)**\n\n![halo\ninfinite](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Halo Infinite release date – when is it coming out?\n\nCurrently, in the works for [Xbox\nOne](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/xbox-one-s) and\n[PC](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/best-gaming-pc-2993099), Microsoft is\nyet to announce a release window for Halo Infinite. We haven’t seen an entry\nin the beloved series for almost three years now, so a 2019 launch doesn’t\nseem out of the question.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: WhatsApp \n\n### The Facebook Effect: WhatsApp says ads coming to Status tab\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/whatsapp-advertisements-status-\ntab-3613630 \"The Facebook Effect: WhatsApp says ads coming to Status tab\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * \n\nOne thing is for certain, it will likely have a playable beta period and\nlaunch with fully-fledged [Xbox One\nX](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/xbox-one-x) support. It will also\ncome as part of [Xbox Game Pass](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/xbox-\ngame-pass-2947834) and [Xbox Play\nAnywhere](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/xbox-play-anywhere-\ngames-2947173).\n\n## Halo Infinite trailer – how does it look?\n\nOnly one trailer has been revealed for Halo Infinite thus far, and it’s this\none from E3 2018:\n\n## Halo Infinite gameplay – how does it play?\n\nInfinite will run on a newly developed technology known as the Slipstream\nEngine. The reveal trailer is made up of in-engine footage, so it’s clear that\n343 Industries is eager to introduce wider, more expansive environments,\nmarine allies and even wildlife across its world.\n\nHowever, we’ve yet to see anything of Halo Infinite from the first-person\nperspective, so it remains unknown if any major changes have been made to the\nclassic formula. It’s been a long time since Halo 5: Guardians, so we’re\nexpecting a few departures to take place.\n\n**What do you want to see from Halo Infinite?
