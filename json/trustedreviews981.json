Here’s what you need to know about\nHDMI 2.1.**\n\nHDMI 2.1 bumps the maximum data transfer rate up to 48 gigabits per second, in\nturn delivering a higher resolution and frame rate – up to 10K and 120fps,\nrespectively.\n\nRefresh rates for 4K will top out at 120Hz, while 8K will peak at a 60Hz. On\ntop of that, the latter can be viewed in HDR, so your at-home viewing\nexperience should certainly benefit.\n\nMost of that jargon won’t appeal to your average Joe or Jane, however. What\nthey’ll be most interested in is the new-found support for Dynamic HDR, a\npreset that adjusts colour settings on the fly to correspond with what’s being\ndisplayed.\n\n**Related:[What is HDR TV?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/hdr-tv-\nhigh-dynamic-television-explained-2927035)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nWhat’s more, the new standard is backward-compatible with older HDMI specs, so\nmanufacturers won’t need to make drastic modifications to their hardware.\nThat’s not to say they won’t take a while to hit the market, though.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nEven with the specification finalised, it will be at least a year until HDMI\n2.1-compliant devices, like Smart TVs, are released.
