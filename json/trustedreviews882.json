Sound, graphics, driving\n\n## Cons\n\n  * Driving to the individual races grates after a while\n\n## Key Features\n\n  * Review Price: £40\n  * Platforms: Xbox One X, Microsoft Windows (We've tested both, and buy for one and you get it on both via Windows Store)\n\nForza Horizon 4 kicks off with a showcase that drops you right into the\naction, barrelling through all seasons in a variety of cars. It’s a taster\nmenu that showcases a few of the delights that the open-world racer is going\nto bestow upon you in the future.\n\nAs a nearly lifelong resident of England though, all I could think was: what\nversion of England is this?\n\nPlanes fly low, hot air balloons hang in the clear sky and the different\nseasons immediately add a new angle to racing. But as each season is suitably\ndistinct, it’s also a long way from England in the real world, which has been\nserving up consistently disappointing shades of grey for most of my life.\n\nThe end of that showcase had me cruising through the maybe-fictional town of\nAshbury at 200mph. “Smile, the crowds have come out to see the race” said a\nvoice in my ear, as confetti pops over the car. I’m glad that I’m moving so\nfast, as it saves me the embarrassment of explaining that I’ve just levelled\nthe town’s welcome sign with my sports car, in addition to several ancient\nwalls as I drifted around a corner on the way into town.\n\n**Related:[Best Gaming Headsets](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\ngaming-headsets-3431813)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSure, this isn’t a real vision of our little island, but as Bill Bryson said\nin Notes From A Small Island: “I like it here. I like it more than I can tell\nyou.”\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nPart of my adoration is that there’s just so much stuff here. Forza Horizon 4,\nfor those unfamiliar with the series, is an open-world racer closer in tone to\nTest Drive Unlimited than Burnout Paradise, with the wealth of content on\noffer in this iteration spoiling me for choice. Your favourite car is\nundoubtedly here, be it a 1997 Lamborghini Diablo, several different models of\nSubaru Impreza or the iconic Warthog from shooter Halo.\n\nYou can buy houses to fast-travel around the map, and they also let you\ncustomise your character. Want to wear shark wellies and a gold top-hat? You\ncan do that here.\n\nWe’re here for the cars, though. These cars, dozens of them, are thrown at you\nas rewards for your performance, via an in-game auction house, in the game’s\nshop, via free loot box-esque ‘wheelspins’ and even within barns hidden in the\ngame world. They’re the real star of the game, and every one of them is viable\nwithin Playground Games’ caricatured vision of Scotland. They’re nearly\nperfectly modelled, and many of them come with body kits and upgrade paths,\nletting you tune and tweak to your heart’s desire. If you don’t fancy that,\nyou can get the game do it for you, putting down a chunk of change to drive\naway with a car at the performance level you want.\n\n**Related:[Best PC Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-pc-\ngames-3520096)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThere is a ridiculous amount of fan-service in the game, which means I can\nhave a car horn that plays the Halo theme, or the Windows XP shutdown noise. A\npre-order bonus means I can drive the Lotus Elise from Bond classic You Only\nLive Twice, and the game sidesteps the classic car game trope of making me\nplow around in a Honda Civic for several hours before I get to play with the\nbig boys. Unless you pick the Ford Focus as your starter motor, but that is\nyour lookout.\n\nThe map is littered with different types of events: dirt racing, road racing,\ncross-country drives and even some semi-legal street races. However, while\nthere’s clearly an optimal type of vehicle for each race: rally cars will have\na better time in dirt races for example, whatever car you show up in, the game\nwill fill the field with other cars from that class, meaning you _can_ do a\ncross-country race in your top of the line Bugatti Chiron, and the game will\npit you against similar cars. That way you can all ruin your supercars\ntogether.\n\nIf that doesn’t suit, the game’s showcases see you facing off against a\nhovercraft, a train, or even a team of motorcyclists.  If you want to avoid\nthe events, make like an ostrich and bury your head in the sand, the open-\nworld has you covered. You could find yourself acting as a stunt driver,\nramping over a windmill or taking a vintage sports car on a fast pursuit down\na country road. Maybe you can find the barns, or tear past a speeding camera\nor speed trap. The world is so detailed and fun to drive around, you could\njust get into whatever your daily driver is and tear around the streets at\neyebrow-raising speed, maybe if you’re lucky you can go back in time and\nreverse that whole Brexit palaver before the whole country gets overrun by\nnationalist fish, or something equally horrific, like us leaving the free\nmarket, making the cheap and timely importing of all of these sportscars\nincredibly expensive.\n\n**Related:[Trusted Reviews – Patch Notes Gaming\nPodcast](https://soundcloud.com/patchnotespodcast)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIt doesn’t really matter what you do in Forza Horizon 4, you’ll be rewarded\nfor it. You can get experience points for streaming, creating custom car\ndesigns, and all of the different types of racing. Rather than a racing game,\nForza Horizon feels more like a car game. That you interact with 95% of the\ntime by competing in races.\n\nAll of this is backed up with a solid soundtrack, with radio station voiced by\nactual DJs. I found myself listening to Hospital Records a lot, voiced by the\ntwo stars of Hospital’s podcast, listening to drum and bass tracks signed by\nthe label. These asides are interesting, well written and often relevant to\nwhat’s going on in the game. Coupled with that is the fact that Forza Horizon\n4 is absolutely stunning. The screenshots here, cut down from 4k to 1280 x\n720, don’t do the game justice.\n\nCruelly, most of the game’s detail is lost at high speeds, and it looks best\nin motion. The way the snow flies off of a tyre during a burnout, or a tree\nspinters after you crash, ahem, navigate through it, all add to one of the\nnicest looking game worlds I’ve seen this year. That you go past it in a\nmotion-induced blur is heartbreaking, but doesn’t make it any less impressive.\n\n## Verdict\n\nYou know what? I adore it. I adore every second. Forza Horizon 4 is\npotentially the best racing game I’ve ever played in terms of the sheer amount\nof stuff and how much fun I’ve had. I’m not a devout racing game fan, so I’m\nnot going to say it’s the best racing game ever, but I can say absolutely that\nit’s the racing game I’m going to be comparing the genre to in my head, moving\nforwards.\n\nSure, Forza Horizon 4 is just an iteration of Forza Horizon 3, but it’s hard\nto care too much about that as you power through the streets of Edinburgh.\nForza Horizon 4 is the complete package.\n\n## Score\n\n  \n\n"}
