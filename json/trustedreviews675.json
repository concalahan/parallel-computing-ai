But are the Nvidia RTX\n2080 Ti, 2080 and 2070 GPUs worthy of your rig?**\n\nWe’ve detailed every spec, feature and price here for the three new GPUs to\nhelp you make the right call – whether that’s the top tier super-powered RTX\n2080 Ti, the powerful mid-range RTX 2080, or the more wallet-friendly RTX\n2070.\n\nNot even sure whether you’ll make the jump up to the new Nvidia RTX series?\nWe’ve also listed all the features of the new range so you’ve all the\ninformation at your disposal to make the right call.\n\n## **Nvidia RTX: What’s new?**\n\nAlthough these cards will be faster than their Pascal predecessors, Nvidia has\nplaced much emphasis on their real-time ray tracing capabilities. This refers\nto a GPU’s ability to render light far more realistically than was previously\npossible.\n\nUnfortunately, real-time ray tracing won’t be supported at launch, so owners\nwill have to wait a few months to enjoy the revolutionary new tech. However,\nNvidia has shown a few trailers for games including [Shadow of the Tomb\nRaider](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider),\n[Metro Exodus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/metro-exodus-release-date-\ngameplay-news-trailer-story-preorder-2952446), [Assetto\nCorsa](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/assetto-corsa), and [Battlefield\nV](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/battlefield-5-release-date-news-\ngameplay-3231890) that show off the new real-time ray tracing tech – which\ncertainly looks promising.\n\nUntil then, the Nvidia RTX performance boost looks to potentially offer 4K\ngaming at 60fps, which will no doubt please gamers with an appetite for Ultra\nHD. Of course, you’ll have to wait until our full review before we confirm\nthis for sure though.\n\nDLSS (Deep Learning Super-Sampling) will also be available from the get go,\nalbeit with very limited game support at launch. DLSS sees the Tensor Cores\n(the processors dedicated to handling AI) of the new Series 20 cards to\naccelerate anti-aliasing, meaning sprites and game environments should look\nsmoother and everything should run more quickly to boot.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nJump to the bottom of the article if you want an even more detailed look into\neach of these two new features.\n\nRead on for everything you need to know about the new Nvidia RTX graphics\ncards in lieu of our full reviews.\n\n**Related:[Best graphics cards](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-graphics-\ncard_round-up \"Best graphics card\")**\n\n## Nvidia RTX 2080 Ti: Specs, price and release date\n\nThe most powerful of the Nvidia RTX trio, the 2080 Ti boasts 18.9 billion\ntransistors, 4352 CUDA Cores, 68 RT Cores and 544 Tensor Cores. That’s a lot\nof juicy numbers, but what do they actually mean?\n\nEssentially, if you want the best possible 4K HDR performance for your video\ngames, then the RTX 2080 Ti is the GPU to plump for. The 2080 Ti – along with\nthe other two RTX GPUs – actually support a maximum 8K resolution (7680 x\n4320) at 12 bits of HDR colour at 60Hz over a DisplayPort 1.4 connection, but\ngamers are far more likely to be dialling down to 4K which sees all the\n20-Series Nvidia GPUs supporting 12-bit HDR at 144Hz.\n\nOur benchmark tests showed that the 2080 Ti can handle the majority of Ultra\nHD games at 60 frames per second, which previous generations of graphics cards\nhave struggled to do.\n\n| **RTX 2080 Ti** | **GTX 1080 Ti**  \n---|---|---  \n**Generation** |  Turing | Pascal  \n**Price** |  £1099 | £669  \n**Announcement** |  August 2018 | March 2017  \n**Cuda cores** |  4352 | 3584  \n**RT cores** |  68 | 0  \n**Tensor cores** |  544 | 0  \n**Base speed** |  1350 | 1493  \n**Boost speed** |  1545 | 1582  \n**RAM** |  11GB GDDR6 | 11 GB GDDR5X  \n**Memory speed** |  14Gbps | 10Gbps  \n**Memory bandwidth** |  616 GB/sec | 484GB/sec  \n**Power draw** |  250W | 250W  \n**Rec. system power** |  650W | 600W  \n  \nOf course, all of this power does not come cheap, with Nvidia shipping the\ncard at an eye watering £1099. That’s £250 more than the RTX 2080.\n\nSo is it worth all the money? If you’re intending on playing games in 4K, then\nabsolutely. Our benchmark results show that there’s a substantial increase in\nframe rate performance for Ultra HD content with the RTX 2080 Ti compared to\nthe GTX 2080 Ti.\n\nWhile the GTX 1080 Ti misses out on the coveted 60fps for new 4K releases like\nShadow of the Tomb Raider, the 2080 Ti hits that 60fps mark for almost every\nUltra HD game chucked its way.\n\nBut if you intend on using the RTX 2080 Ti for HD or SD gaming, you won’t see\na huge difference from what you got with the Pascal generation and so you’re\nlikely better off buying a cheaper graphics card.\n\nOf course, once ray tracing arrives that’s likely to change dramatically, but\nwe won’t know to what extent until support for the technology arrives later\nthis year.\n\n**Related:[Nvidia RTX 2080 Ti\nreview](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nvidia-rtx-2080-ti)**\n\n## Nvidia RTX 2080 Ti vs GTX 1080 Ti – benchmarks\n\n|  GTX 1080 Ti (4K) | RTX 2080 Ti (4K) | RTX 2080 Ti vs GTX 1080 Ti (4K)  \n---|---|---|---  \nShadow of the Tomb Raider | 44 | 57 | +29.6%  \nGhost Recon  \nWildlands | 37.1 | 45.9 | +23.7%  \nDirt Rally | 93.9 | 117.4 | +25%  \nAshes of the Singularity | 53.3 | 65 | +22%  \n  \nThe 2080 Ti also has 11GB of 14Gbps GDDR6, memory, which further explains how\nit’s been able to provide such an outstanding performance.\n\nLike all the RTX 20 Series graphics cards, the 2080 Ti also includes support\nfor USB Type-C and VirtualLink. The latter promises a more streamlined and\neasier format for setting up virtual reality in the future, which is great to\nsee as the 2080 Ti looks to be a fantastic GPU for VR.\n\nThe Nvidia RTX 2080 Ti is available to buy right now for £1099.\n\n![Nvidia RTX\n2080](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Related:[Best Gaming PCs](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/best-gaming-\npc-2018-2993099)**\n\n## Nvidia RTX 2080: Specs, price and release date\n\nThe Nvidia RTX 2080 is the mid-range option of the new generation graphics\ncards. It’s also likely going to be the most popular of the three, with a\nseemingly superb balancing act between performance and price.\n\nShowcasing 13.6 billion transistors, it’s quite a distance behind the 2080\nTi’s specs. However, that doesn’t stop the RTX 2080 from being another great\ngraphics card for 4K gaming, especially since it’s capable of handling Ultra\nHD HDR at 60Hz.\n\n| **RTX 2080** | **GTX 1080**  \n---|---|---  \n**Generation** |  Turing | Pascal  \n**Price** |  £749 | £469  \n**Announcement** |  August 2018 | May 2016  \n**Cuda cores** |  2944 | 2560  \n**RT cores** |  46 | 0  \n**Tensor cores** |  384 | 0  \n**Base speed** |  1515 | 1607  \n**Boost speed** |  1710 (1800 Founders) | 1733  \n**RAM** |  8GB GDDR6 | 8GB GDDR5X  \n**Memory speed** |  14Gbps | 10Gbps  \n**Memory bandwidth** |  448 GB/sec | 320 GB/sec  \n**Power draw** |  215W | 180W  \n**Rec. system power** |  650W | 500W  \n  \nOnly those that use £20 notes to light the finest Cuban cigars will call the\nRTX 2080 ‘cheap’ at £749, but it is more affordable that the 2080 Ti. And\nwhile the latter does boast better benchmarks, both are still fully capable of\nproducing gorgeous 4K renders.\n\nAgain, we’ve provided Nvidia’s benchmark results below to show that the RTX\n2080 looks to be a great option for Ultra HD gaming. Still, if you’re not\nready to make the jump to 4K just yet, then the difference in HD performance\nbetween this GPU and those from last generation probably isn’t worth the\noutlay.\n\n## Nvidia RTX 2080 vs GTX 1080 – official benchmarks\n\n|  **GTX** **1080** |  **RTX** **2080** | **RTX 2080 vs GTX 1080**  \n---|---|---|---  \nBattlefield 1 (SDR) | 52.5 | 72.3 | +37.7%  \nBattlefield 1 (HDR RGB444) | 48.9 | 72.2 | +47.8%  \nBattlefield 1 (HDR YUV422) | 44.2 | 73.0 | +65.4%  \nCall of Duty: WWII (SDR) | 66.0 | 104.2 | +57.8%  \nCall of Duty: WWII (HDR RGB444) | 66.4 | 100.5 | +51.3%  \nCall of Duty: WWII (HDR YUV422) | 59.7 | 95.7 | +60.3%  \nF1 2018 (SDR) | 51.8 | 72.0 | +39.1%  \nF1 2018 (HDR RGB444) | 51.1 | 72.8 | +42.4%  \nF1 2018 (HDR YUV 442) | 46.5 | 72.8 | +56.5%  \nPlayerUnknown’s Battleground | 46.3 | 61.6 | +33.0%  \nShadow of the Tomb Raider | 31.7 | 47.1 | +48.6%  \nWitcher 3 | 43.3 | 61.5 | +42.0%  \n  \nIt is possible, however, that real-time ray tracing could make bring about\nenough improvements to justify the upgrade even if you’re still stuck with a\nHD monitor. But with software support for the new technology yet to launch,\nwe’re unable to say for sure.\n\nSupport should arrive later this year though, so keep your eyes on _Trusted\nReviews_ to find our verdict on it. For now though, you can read our in-depth\nlook at real-time ray tracing below.\n\nThe Nvidia RTX 2080 is available to buy right now.\n\n## Nvidia RTX 2070 Specs, price and release date\n\nThe RTX 2070 is the sprog of the RTX litter, offering the least amount of\npower but at the most affordable price at £569.\n\nHowever there isn’t as much information floating about for the RTX 2070 as its\nsibling graphics cards, aside from its October 17 release date. No official\ninformation about the RTX 2070 performance and benchmarks has been released by\nNvidia, and, at the time of writing, nothing’s been leaked.\n\n| **RTX 2070** | **GTX 1070**  \n---|---|---  \n**Generation** |  Turing | Pascal  \n**Price** |  £569 | £419  \n**Announcement** |  August 2018 | May 2016  \n**Cuda cores** |  2304 | 1920  \n**RT cores** | ? |  0  \n**Tensor cores** | ? |  0  \n**Base speed** |  1410 | 1506  \n**Boost speed** |  1710 | 1683  \n**RAM** |  8GB GDDR6 | 8GB GDDR5  \n**Memory speed** |  14 Gbps | 8 Gbps  \n**Memory bandwidth** |  448 GB/s | 256 GB/s  \n**Power draw** |  175W | 150W  \n**Rec. system power** |  550W | 500W  \n  \nNvidia claims the RTX 2070 will – just like the 2080 and 2080 Ti – be able to\nrender 4K images at 60 frames per second, but with testing units still to be\ndistributed this is yet to confirmed.\n\nThe RTX 2070 will also support real-time ray tracing, offering 5 Giga\nRays/sec.\n\nA Giga Ray is an Nvidia term for a simulated ray of light. 5 Giga Rays/sec is\nthe minimum amount of virtual light required to fully illuminate a typical\nroom in a video game environment, according to Nvidia.\n\nSo, the RTX 2070 offers the standard 5 Giga Rays/sec. For comparison, the 2080\noffers 8 Giga Rays/sec and the 2080 Ti a whopping 10 Giga Rays/sec.\n\n**Nvidia RTX 2070** | **Nvidia RTX 2080** | **Nvidia RTX 2080 Ti**  \n---|---|---  \n8GB frame buffer | 8GB frame buffer | 11GB frame buffer  \n6 GigaRays/second | 8 GigaRays/second | 10 Giga Rays/second  \n45T RTX-OPS | 60T RTX-OPS | 78T RTX-OPS  \n  \nIt’s impossible to say to what extent these specs have on the visuals right\nnow, as real-time ray tracing software support has yet to launch, but getting\nsuch exciting features at the RTX 2070’s reasonable price is a huge incentive.\nThat said, the option to upgrade to the RTX 2080 for £180 more is surely going\nto be tempting.\n\nAs soon as we find more information regarding the RTX 2070’s performance,\nwe’ll be sure to update this section.\n\n## Nvidia RTX 2080, 2080 Ti and 2070 GPUs features – Ray tracing explained\n\nThe big development with Nvidia’s Turing graphics cards is real-time ray\ntracing, which will massively increase the realism of how games handle\nlighting.\n\nWhile real-time ray-tracing isn’t yet available to the public, we already have\na decent idea of how games benefiting from the tech will look, thanks to a\nnumber of demos released by Nvidia over the past year. Some have shown ray-\ntracing in real-time on consumer GPUs.\n\nNvidia has already worked with Microsoft and Epic to get ray tracing\nintegrated into DirectX and the Unreal Engine to produce a real-time demo that\nwas shown off at GDC earlier this year.\n\nHowever, powerful hardware is required to render these types of scenes, which\nhas led Nvidia to develop its new Turing chip with a ray-tracing core, called\nthe RT Core. This makes the chip specialised for running RTX content such as\nNvidia’s short ‘Sol’, which the company claimed was running on just a single\nTuring GPU.\n\nThe chip will also be capable of running deep learning algorithms according to\nNvidia, and will include AI image processing capabilities, too. The latter\nshould be helpful when running high levels of anti-aliasing in games.\n\nOf course, of utmost importance are the games, and Nvidia has already shown\noff the technology powering advanced lighting in Shadow of the Tomb Raider,\nMetro Exodus, Assetto Corsa, and Battlefield V’s RTX integration in new demos\nand trailers.\n\nIn total, Nvidia has announced 11 games on its website that will offer real-\ntime ray tracing:\n\n  * Assetto Corsa Competizione\n  * Atomic Heart\n  * Battlefield V\n  * Control\n  * Enlisted\n  * Justice\n  * JX3\n  * MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries\n  * Metro Exodus\n  * ProjectDH\n  * Shadow of the Tomb Raider\n\nIn addition to ray tracing, the Founders Editions of the Nvidia RTX 2080, 2080\nTi and 2070 cards will feature a redesigned cooling system that Nvidia claims\nis much quieter than previous iterations.\n\n**Related:[Shadow of the Tomb Raider\nreview](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider)**\n\n## Nvidia RTX 2080, 2080 Ti and 2070 GPUs features – DLSS\n\nAnother new feature for the RTX 20 Series includes Deep Learning Super-\nSampling (DLSS), which ostensibly improves on super sampling and multisample\nanti-aliasing (MSAA).\n\nAs the name suggests, DLSS leverages artificial intelligence, enabled by the\n114 TFLOP Tensor Cores, to handle some of the anti-aliasing processes. Nvidia\nclaims that this technique ensures picture quality that’s of the same standard\nof traditionally rendered images, but with even better performance.\n\nAnti-aliasing essentially involves a GPU recognising colour values and\napplying them to pixels. In theory, AI processes trained on colour recognition\nshould give you a performance boost by way of speeding that up. Everything\nshould look much smoother and because the GPU is freer to do other things,\neverything should also run more quickly.\n\nUnlike ray tracing, Nvidia suggests that DLSS is easy to integrate into video\ngames, which could see the list of compatible games increase quickly. As of\nnow, 25 games offer support. They include:\n\n  * Ark: Survival Evolved \n  * Darksiders 3\n  * Final Fantasy XV \n  * **Hellb** **lade: Senua’s Sacrifice**\n  * Hitman 2 \n  * Mechwarrior 5: Mercenaries\n  * Islands of Nyne: Battle Royale\n  * Overkill’s The Walking Dead \n  * PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds\n  * SCUM \n  * Shadow of the Tomb Raider\n  * Stormdivers\n  * We Happy Few\n\nOnce we’ve finished our testing, we’ll be able to confirm whether or not DLSS\nmakes a noticeable improvement.\n\n**Related:[What is HDR gaming?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/what-\nis-hdr-gaming-2946693)**\n\n## **Nvidia RTX 2080 and RTX 2080 Ti – Performance**\n\nWhile we’ve only been able to test the RTX 2080 Ti card out of the three new\nTuring GPUs, Nvidia has shared some 4K (3840 x 2160) frame rate benchmarking\nresults of how both the GTX 1080 and GTX 1080 Ti compare to the new RTX 2080\nand RTX 2080 Ti GPUs.\n\nNote that the testing rig for both graphics cards was the same – Nvidia’s\nprovided a short breakdown:\n\n  * **Processor:** Intel Core i9-7900X 3.3GHz CPU\n  * **RAM:** 16GB Corsair DDR4\n  * **Motherboard:** Asus X299 Rampage VI Apex\n  * **OS:** Windows 10 (v1803) 64-bit\n  * **Nvidia drivers:** 411.38\n\n|  **GTX** **1080** |  **RTX** **2080** | **RTX 2080 vs GTX 1080** |  **GTX**\n**1080 Ti** |  **RTX** **2080 Ti** |  **RTX 2080 Ti** **vs GTX 1080** **Ti**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nBattlefield 1 (SDR) | 52.5 | 72.3 | +37.7% | 60.3 | 88.7 | +47.1%  \nBattlefield 1 (HDR RGB444) | 48.9 | 72.2 | +47.8% | 62.2 | 86.5 | +39.1%  \nBattlefield 1 (HDR YUV422) | 44.2 | 73.0 | +65.4% | 56.5 | 88.2 | +56.2%  \nCall of Duty: WWII (SDR) | 66.0 | 104.2 | +57.8% | 90.6 | 138.8 | +53.2%  \nCall of Duty: WWII (HDR RGB444) | 66.4 | 100.5 | +51.3% | 89.1 | 129.6 |\n+45.4%  \nCall of Duty: WWII (HDR YUV422) | 59.7 | 95.7 | +60.3% | 80.0 | 129.7 | +62.0%  \nF1 2018 (SDR) | 51.8 | 72.0 | +39.1% | 62.5 | 90.5 | +44.7%  \nF1 2018 (HDR RGB444) | 51.1 | 72.8 | +42.4% | 64.8 | 91.9 | +41.7%  \nF1 2018 (HDR YUV 442) | 46.5 | 72.8 | +56.5% | 59.7 | 91.2 | +52.7%  \nPlayerUnknown’s Battleground | 46.3 | 61.6 | +33.0% | 57.7 | 79.3 | +37.4%  \nShadow of the Tomb Raider | 31.7 | 47.1 | +48.6% | 43.2 | 59.2 | +36.9%  \nWitcher 3 | 43.3 | 61.5 | +42.0% | 57.0 | 78.1 | +36.8%  \n  \nWe’ve no information on the PSU used, or the GPU cooler (of even if there was\none).\n\nThe fps (frames per second) scores here were achieved using Nvidia’s own\ninternal testing processes on a range of DirectX 11 (Call of Duty: WWII, F1\n2018, PlayerUnknown’s Battleground, Witcher 3) and DirectX 12 games\n(Battlefield 1, Shadow of the Time), which we’ve partially reproduced above.\n\nThe benchmarking process is one devised by Nvidia itself, and it involves\ntesting games at both standard dynamic range and HDR where possible. They use\nthe Nvidia Control Panel to set monitor refresh rates to 98Hz (10-bits of\ncolour) and 120Hz (8-bits of colour) on SDR and HDR tests using the RGB 4:4:4\ncolour format and 120Hz (10-bits of colour) and 144Hz (8/10-bits of colour).\n\nIf you’re looking to replicate these results, Nvidia recommends using an [Acer\nPredator X27](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/acer-predator-x27) and\n[Asus ROG Swift PG27UQ](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/asus-pg27uq)\ngaming monitors, suggesting (but not confirming) that these were the monitors\nused in the testing process.\n\nRegardless how accurate these findings are, we’re expecting a monster\nperformance from the RTX 20-Series graphics cards. Nvidia boldly suggests that\nthe GeForce RTX 2080 is so powerful that the CPU can act as the bottleneck.\n\nFortunately, we’ll soon see the release of [Intel’s 9th Gen\nCPUs](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/intel-9th-gen-cpu-release-date-\nspecs-3501382) as well as a slew of [compatible motherboards\narriving](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-motherboard), which should\nboth help to prevent future bottlenecks with the RTX 2080.\n\n**Related:[Intel 9th Gen CPU](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/intel-9th-\ngen-cpu-release-date-specs-3501382)**\n\n## Nvidia RTX 2080, 2080 Ti and 2070 GPUs – Specs\n\nSince the launch event, Nvidia has updated us with a fuller set of specs for\nboth the reference and Founders Edition models:\n\n| **Nvidia RTX 2070 (Ref spec)** | **Nvidia RTX 2070 (Founders Ed)** |\n**Nvidia RTX 2080 (Ref spec)** | **Nvidia RTX 2080 (Founders Ed)** | **Nvidia\nRTX 2080 Ti (Ref spec)** | **Nvidia RTX 2080 Ti (Founders Ed)**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nBase Clock | 1410 MHz | 1410 MHz | 1515 MHz | 1515 MHz | 1350 MHz | 1350 MHz  \nBoost Clock | 1620 MHz | 1710 MHz (OC) | 1710 MHz | 1800 MHz (OC) | 1545 MHz |\n1635 MHz (OC)  \nCUDA cores | 2304 | 2304 | 2944 | 2944 | 4352 | 4352  \nMemory Speed | 14Gbps | 14Gbps | 14Gbps | 14Gbps | 14Gbps | 14Gbps  \nStandard Memory Config | 8GB GDDR6 | 8GB GDDR6 | 8GB GDDR6 | 8GB GDDR6 | 11GB\nGDDR6 | 11GB GDDR6  \nMemory Interface Width | 256-bit | 256-bit | 256-bit | 256-bit | 352-bit |\n352-bit  \nMemory Bandwidth | 448 GB/sec | 448 GB/sec | 448 GB/sec | 448 GB/sec | 616\nGB/sec | 616 GB/sec  \n  \nAll support a maximum 8K resolution (7680 x 4320) at 12 bits of HDR colour at\n60Hz over a DisplayPort 1.4 connection. Dialling down to 4K – which, let’s be\nhonest, most gamers will want to – sees all the 20-Series Nvidia GPUs\nsupporting 12-bit HDR at 144Hz.\n\nSeeing as more 4K gaming monitors are now supporting 144Hz rates, and UHD\nmonitors are approaching sensible prices, we think that most gamers will be\nmore than happy with this.\n\nDisplayPort, HDMI and USB Type-C connections are supported across the range.\n\n**Related:**[ **Best Gaming\nMonitors**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-gaming-monitor-3439027)\n\nHere’s a brief overview of each card’s physical characteristics and power\nrequirements:\n\n|  ****Nvidia** RTX 2070**\n\n**(Ref spec)**\n\n| ****Nvidia** RTX 2070 (Founders Ed)** |  ****Nvidia** RTX 2080**\n\n**(Ref spec)**\n\n| ****Nvidia** RTX 2080 (Founders Ed)** | ****Nvidia** RTX 2080 Ti (Ref\nspec)** | ****Nvidia** RTX 2080 Ti (Founders Ed)**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nHeight | 112.6mm (4.435-inches) | 112.6mm (4.435-inches) | 115.7mm\n(4.556-inches) | 115.7mm (4.556-inches) | 115.7mm (4.556-inches) | 115.7mm\n(4.556-inches)  \nLength | 228.60mm (9-inches) | 228.60mm (9-inches) | 266.74mm (10.5-inches) |\n266.74mm (10.5-inches) | 266.74mm (10.5-inches) | 266.74mm (10.5-inches)  \nWidth | 2-slot | 2-slot | 2-slot | 2-slot | 2-slot | 2-slot  \nGraphics Card Power | 185W | 175W | 185W | 225W | 250W | 260W  \nRecommended System Power | 550W | 550W | 650W | 650W | 650W | 650W  \nMaximum GPU Temperature | 89ºC (192.2ºF) | 89ºC (192.2ºF) | 88ºC (190.4ºF) |\n88ºC (190.4ºF) | 89ºC (192.2ºF) | 89ºC (192.2ºF)  \n  \nSupport for Microsoft Direct X 12, Vulkan, OpenGL 4/5 are confirmed across the\nboard. As are Nvidia proprietary standards such as G-Sync, GeForce Experience,\nGPU Boost and Ansel.\n\nHere’s how the three GPU types compare:\n\n**Nvidia RTX 2070** | **Nvidia RTX 2080** | **Nvidia RTX 2080 Ti**  \n---|---|---  \n8GB frame buffer | 8GB frame buffer | 11GB frame buffer  \n6 GigaRays/second | 8 GigaRays/second | 10 Giga Rays/second  \n45T RTX-OPS | 60T RTX-OPS | 78T RTX-OPS  \n  \nFrame buffers are portions of a GPU’s RAM that are generally reserved for\nstoring information for a game’s colour palette. As you can see from the\nlimited spec sheet above, the frame buffers of the Nvidia RTX 2080 and 2070\nare of the same size.\n\nPresumably, the 2080 with its higher Giga Rays per second count will be able\nto render an increased palette at any one time, which may be the reason Nvidia\nhas bumped up the buffer on the 2080 Ti. The higher the resolution of a\ndisplay, the more strain will be placed on the frame buffer. All of these\ncards support 4k at 60fps.\n\nWe’re not certain of what we can discern from the RTX-OPS spec, other than –\nobviously – the larger the number, the more operations the system can run at\nany one time. Or, more simply, the prettier the lighting effect.\n\nPortions of Nvidia’s demo focused on the graphical polish the RTX system can\ngive to a game. Many ‘oohed’ and ‘ahhed’ on seeing the shadows in Shadow of\nthe Tomb Raider soften and lights throw layers of umbra and penumbra behind\nsprites instead of harsher, crisper shadows when the same game was played with\nRTX turned off.\n\nSimilarly, RTX meant that reflective surfaces such as glass and puddles in\nBattlefield V also looked more realistic, instead of a muddy pixellated mush.\n\nBut, what’s the difference between 45T RTX-OPS and 78T RTX-OPS? Nvidia itself\nadmits that the term is rather vague. The RTX-OPS scores listed here are\naggregates of the numbers of operations run by each GPU’s ray tracing (RT)\ncores, Tensor cores, shaders and CUDA cores. These are all components of the\ngraphics card that will have to work together and individually to power the\nlustrous and dynamic lighting features promised.\n\nSince they’re aggregates, and we don’t know how Nvidia has arrived at those\nfigures, it’s currently impossible to determine which parts are doing the most\nheavy-lifting – and whether a more expensive 2080 Ti is demonstrably better\nthan a 2080.\n\nNvidia also says that the RTX-OPS figures it has posted refer only to the\nFounders Editions versions of the 20-Series cards. ‘Founders Edition’ is\nbasically Nvidia marketing spiel for ‘reference design’. It means that if you\nwere to pick up an Asus ROG Strix version of the 2080 Ti, things might be a\nlittle different.\n\nIn addition, we’re yet to see the sort of impact this actually has on gaming,\nin terms of that last spec being a useful signpost for how a card will perform\nagainst others in its range. Given the proprietary nature of the RTX standard,\nit will be hard to compare side-by-side, and near-impossible to do so at a\nglance.\n\n## Nvidia RTX 20 Series: Which is the best graphics card for me?\n\nIt’s hard to be sure given that the RTX 2070 is yet to be benchmarked, but so\nfar the RTX 2080 looks to have the best balance between performance and power.\n\nOf course, if money is no object and you want the very best performance\npossible, then it’s a no-brainer – the RTX 2080 Ti is the card to go for.\n\nWith all that said, the average gamer probably has little need for any of\nNvidia’s RTX graphics cards right now. Unless you’ve got a 4K PC setup and are\ncraving buttery smooth 60fps, then these new cards probably aren’t worth the\ncost.\n\nThis could all change once real-time ray tracing support rolls out, but for\nnow, HD gamers are best off sticking with a GTX 1070 or 1080.\n\n**Are you tempted to buy the new Nvidia RTX Series 20 graphics cards?
