Amazon managed to slash £60 off the price of its second-generation\nEcho, and[Google Home](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-home)\ngoes for a not-unreasonable £130. Yes, Apple pushed things higher with the\n£350 [Apple HomePod](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/apple-homepod),\nbut if you think that’s pricey, then prepare your wallet for some bad news\nbefore reading on.**\n\nBack at CES, the audiophiles at Bang & Olufsen revealed they would be\nreleasing a pair of Google Assistant-powered smart speakers later in the year,\nand now we have some more details of what they’ll look like and when they’re\nout.\n\n**Related:**[ **Amazon Echo vs Google\nHome**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-home-vs-amazon-\necho-2945424)\n\nBut before all that: the price. The BeoSound 1 – a portable speaker that can\nrun off a battery – comes in at $1750 (~£1360). The BeoSound 2 which requires\na constant connection to the mains in order to “produce its vigorous output of\nexcellent sound” costs $2250 (~£1750).\n\nIn other words, one BeoSound 2 speaker costs around the same as five Apple\nHomePods. Or 19 Amazon Echos.\n\nOf course, Bang & Olufsen would no doubt argue that the speaker is worth the\nextra because it provides hitherto unheard of smart speaker sound quality. We\ncan’t really comment on that until we put them through an ear test of our own,\nthough the non-smart version of the BeoSound 1 sounded decent enough when we\nreviewed it [back in 2017](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/bang-\nolufsen-beosound-1).\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThis time, of course, the speakers will pack Google Assistant, which means you\ncan use Spotify, Google Play Music, as well as Chromecast and AirPlay 2 to get\nthe best out of your new pride and joy.\n\nB&O says the speakers will contain five microphones with echo-cancelling\ntechnology. The idea here is that Google Assistant will always be able to hear\nyou, even if it’s blasting out music at top volume. We’d have to try it in\nperson to see how well it works in practice, but it would certainly get around\none of the annoyances of our current crop of smart speakers.\n\nThe BeoSound 1 will arrive in “key markets” in September, with the larger\nBeoSound 2 due to arrive the following month.\n\n**Would you spend this much on a smart speaker?
