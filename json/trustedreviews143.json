Both of them are excellent in their own\nways, so it’s time for a head to head:[LG\nC8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/lg-c8-oled) vs [Samsung\nQ9FN](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-q9fn-qled).**\n\nThe Samsung Q9FN is a backlit LCD with about 480 dimming zones and a peak\nbrightness of over 2000 nits. The LG C8 is an OLED whose brightness never\nbreaks the 1000-nit barrier, but it has per-pixel lighting precision, which\nhelps with contrast.\n\n## **LG C8 vs Samsung Q9FN – Brightness**\n\nFor the most part, this is a clear victory for the Samsung QLED TV. Bright HDR\nscenes, such as the exterior real-world sequences in _Ready Player One_ , or\n_Mad Max: Fury Road_ ’s daylight desert sequences, blaze off the screen with\nan intensity that really feels like daylight. This overwhelmingly bright sort\nof HDR image looks significantly less intense on the OLED set.\n\nBear in mind though that the extent of the difference in brightness between\nthe two screens is pretty much negated with standard dynamic range playback.\nIt also depends on how brightly an HDR source was mastered.\n\nAlso, while the Samsung QLED model wins comfortably on brightness with mostly\nbright HDR content, there is an exception to the brightness ‘rule’, which is\ncovered in the next Contrast section.\n\n**Related:[Best TVs](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-tv-3440232)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n## **LG C8 vs Samsung Q9FN – Contrast**\n\nThis is an interesting one. The QLED set can, thanks to its direct lighting\nsystem, deliver ne\n\n![LG C8 vs Samsung\nQ9FN](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSamsung Q9FN\n\nar-perfect black levels as well as brightness peaks that are more than twice\nas high as the OLED’s. The issue is that even with its excellent local dimming\nsystem, the QLED set can’t deliver both those blacks and those whites\nsimultaneously as well as LG’s OLED can.\n\nThanks to its per-pixel light control, OLED can maintain inky blacks just a\npixel away from bright whites and colours. There’s no need to compromise one\nto achieve the other.\n\nSo while the LG C8 might not hit the same light peaks, shots containing a\nstrong mix of dark and light content look punchier and more dynamic on the LG\nOLED. In fact, really extreme content, such as candles or street lights\nappearing against dark backdrops, look almost luminous on the OLED, whereas\nthey can look really quite muted on the QLED.\n\nThe difference in the way the QLED and OLED screens deliver their light also\ngives a clear advantage to the OLED when it comes to shadow detail in very\ndark parts of the picture.\n\nFor instance, as Patrick Hockstetter searches the sewers in _It_ , there’s a\nshot of him illuminated by a cigarette lighter against an extremely dark\nbackdrop.\n\nOn the OLED, you can still make out subtle details of brickwork and\nreflections in the dark area around him. On the QLED, much of this detail is\nlost due to the way the TV has to take so much light out of the darkest parts\nof the picture to maintain its class-leading (for LCD) deep black levels.\n\n**Related:[What is QLED?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/what-is-qled-\nthe-future-of-tv-tech-explained-2945941)**\n\n![LG C8 vs Samsung\nQ9FN](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nLG C8\n\n## **LG C8 vs Samsung Q9FN – Colour**\n\nThis, again, is an interesting one. The QLED undoubtedly has things sewn up\nwhen it comes to colour volume, getting more out of the potential of 4K Blu-\nray’s HDR and wide colour technologies to make the action look more ‘real\nworld’.\n\nThe QLED TV does so well here because a) it can go significantly brighter than\nthe OLED, and so can deliver more of the visible colour volume spectrum, and\nb) it can deliver its brightest tones without colours starting to look forced\nand unnatural.\n\nBut the OLED can make a mark with colour during dark scenes. The way the QLED\nTV needs to dim down its lights to deliver good black levels means colours in\ndark areas can look flatter – sometimes much flatter – than they do on the\nOLED.\n\n**Related:[Samsung QLED TVs](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-qled-\ntv-models-qled-price-3367473)**\n\n## **LG C8 vs Samsung Q9FN – Viewing angles**\n\nLG’s OLED technology easily takes this one, as you’d expect. With Samsung’s\nlatest QLED TVs, you can’t watch them from an angle of more than 30 degrees\noff axis without colour tones shifting and contrast reducing. You see more\nbacklight blooming around bright objects when viewing from an angle, too.\n\nThe OLED TVs can be watched from pretty much right angles with no colour\ndesaturation or contrast reduction.\n\n![LG C8 vs Samsung\nQ9FN](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSamsung Q9FN\n\n## **LG C8 vs Samsung Q9FN – Sharpness and detail**\n\nWith the QLED and OLED TVs both carrying the same ‘4K’ number of pixels, you\nwould expect things to be equal here. But a combination of processing\ndifferences and, perhaps, the colour volume/shadow detail performance does\ndeliver a difference.\n\nOddly, the E8 OLED can look slightly crisper with foregrounded content, but\nthe Q9FN tends to look sharper across the whole image, including backgrounds.\nEspecially with shots that contain a large depth of field.\n\nThe Samsung also retains more detail in the very brightest parts of HDR\npictures. This is because its extra brightness helps it avoid ‘clipping’,\nwhere really peak parts of HDR images that are mastered more brightly than a\nTV can manage may look ‘bleached out’.\n\nThe latest LG OLEDs fare much better in this respect than previous\ngenerations, and at the moment, HDR content that’s mastered to HDR levels way\nbeyond the capabilities of the latest OLED TVs is relatively rare. But this\npeak light detailing is a key QLED advantage nonetheless.\n\n**Related:[LG TVs](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/new-lg-tv-3430469)**\n\n## **LG C8 vs Samsung Q9FN – Motion**\n\nOn paper, LG’s OLED TVs should have the edge here. The way LCD TVs work, with\nmoving liquid crystals, means they take longer to react to changes in the\nimage than OLEDs, which essentially just have to adjust the voltage going into\neach OLED pixel.\n\nIn reality, though, once video processing has been added to the equation,\nthings aren’t so clear-cut with our two head-to-head models. There’s\ninherently more judder in the OLED presentation, but slightly more blurring in\nthe QLED presentation. And the processing LG and Samsung offer to correct for\nthese issues can cause broadly similar amounts of unwanted digital side\neffects. So overall, this section is probably a low-scoring draw.\n\n![LG C8 vs Samsung\nQ9FN](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nLG C8\n\n## **LG C8 vs Samsung Q9FN – Image retention**\n\nWe couldn’t test this in our head to head, as even if screen burn/image\nretention were to occur at all on the LG C8, it would take far longer than we\nhad available for our tests.\n\n**Related:[Sony ZF9 vs Samsung Q9FN](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/sony-\nzf9-vs-samsung-q9fn-3527002)**\n\n## **LG C8 vs Samsung Q9FN – Price**\n\nThe pricing is close, but LG currently has the upper hand, and for many that\nwill be the deciding factor.\n\nAt the time of writing, the 65-inch Samsung Q9FN costs £3299. The 65-inch LG\nC8 costs £2999, which is £200 less. It’s a similar story at 55 inchs: the\nSamsung Q9FN will set you back £2499, while the LG C8 is £500 cheaper at\n£1999. There are constant price drops and redemption offers, though, so make\nsure to shop around.\n\n"}
