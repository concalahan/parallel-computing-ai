The Huawei AI Cube was one of the firm’s\nbiggest announcements, serving as both an Alexa-powered smart speaker and 4G\nrouter but there were other interesting entries including world’s first 7nm\nmobile processor, the[Kirin\n980](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/kirin-980-features-release-\ndate-3548238), along with a personal location tracker.**\n\nThe firm also used IFA to announce new colourways for its [Huawei’s P20\nPro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/huawei-p20-pro) smartphone and we\ngrabbed a sneak peek at the upcoming [Huawei Mate 20\nLite](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/huawei-mate-20-lite).\n\nRead on for everything you need to know about Huawei’s lineup from Europe’s\nbiggest technology show.\n\n![Huawei AI Cube in\nhand](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Huawei AI Cube\n\nHuawei’s AI Cube is an intriguing proposition. At first glance, it looks like\nlittle more than another Alexa speaker (and not a cube-shaped one at that),\nbut look at the specs and you’ll see this is a full-on LTE router complete\nwith 802.11ac Wi-Fi for getting the rest of your devices hooked up to the\ninternet.\n\nYou’ll need to insert a 4G SIM card to get the LTE functionality working, but\nafter that, you’ll be left with a device that could potentially get your whole\nhome connected to the internet, as well as a speaker that can do everything an\nAmazon Echo can do.\n\nThere’s no word yet on a price or release date, but it’s a very intriguing\nproduct that we can’t wait to get into our labs and try out for ourselves.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n![Huawei Kirin 980 processor on display\nstand](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Kirin 980 processor\n\nHuawei’s new Kirin 980 chipset brings a heap of firsts to the table. It’s the\nworld’s first mobile processor built on a 7nm process, it’s the first to sport\nARM-based Cortex A76 cores, it’s the first to sport a triple cluster core\ndesign comprised of two big, two middle and four small cores, with intelligent\nAI-based predictive management and it’s the first to pack in a Cat.21 LTE\nmodem.\n\nThere are actually more firsts in the 980’s possession but if you want to full\nlow-down of what it’s capable of and how it stacks up against its predecessor,\nthe Kirin 970 and Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 845, check out our full explainer.\n\n**Related:[Everything you need to know about the Kirin\n980](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/kirin-980-features-release-\ndate-3548238)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Huawei Locator\n\nThe Huawei Locator was a surprise entrant in this year’s haul; a small dongle\nthat’s designed to be able to pinpoint your location wherever you are on the\nglobe thanks to its support for four different global navigation satellite\nsystems (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo and Beidou).\n\nAn SOS button allows you to ping your location using the device, while\ngeofencing generates an alert when the device moves into or out of a certain\nlocation. Finally, BLE Found is a service that will cause the locator to buzz\nwhen it moves out of range of a paired smartphone (allowing it to work as a\npotential theft deterrent).\n\nHuawei wasn’t yet ready to announce a price or release date for the locator.\n\n![Huawei P20 Pro in late 2018\nfinishes](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## New gradient and leather Huawei P20 finishes\n\nAlong with the gamut of new hardware Huawei unveiled at the show it also\ndecided to expand its line of [Huawei\nP20](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/huawei-p20) colourways. Adding to\nthe existing gradient-backed options came two new shades: a pearlescent white\nmodel, aptly named Pearl White and a more intense-looking variation on the\nalready-popular Twilight finish, strangely named Morpho Aurora, apparently\nnamed after the Morpho butterfly.\n\nIn addition, there are now two leather-backed versions of the [Huawei P20\nPro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/huawei-p20-pro) out there; the tan\nversion features gold metal trim around the phone’s edge, whilst the black\nleather version uses silver trim. These leather-backed versions are also\nthicker than their glass-backed counterparts, eliminating the phone’s camera\nbump and featuring embossed logos and type. Both boast 8GB of RAM and a\nwhopping 256GB of internal storage.\n\nAll four new versions are slated for a September 5 launch in Europe, with the\ntwo gradient-backed versions costing the same as the current phone P20 and P20\nPro handsets already available, whilst the beefier leather-backed P20 Pros\nwill sell for a whopping €999 (approximately £895/$1160).\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Huawei Mate 20 Lite\n\nWhile the [Huawei Mate 20 Lite](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/huawei-\nmate-20-lite) wasn’t announced on stage during the opening IFA keynote,\n_Trusted Reviews_ was able to go hands-on with the phone behind closed doors.\nWe’d seen a couple of leaks and rumours doing the rounds for several months\nahead of its reveal, and last week Vodafone UK even took the unusual step of\n[announcing the phone before its\nmanufacturer](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/mate-20-lite-leaked-\nvodafone-3537639).\n\nNow, however, the phone is official and it’s the first device to be launched\nfrom the Mate 20 series (which is expected to eventually consist of three\ndevices alongside the Mate 20 and the Mate 20 Pro).\n\n**Related:[Everything you need to know about the Huawei Mate\n20](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/huawei-mate-20-pro-lite-3486661)**\n\nAs well as being powered by the new Kirin 710 SoC the phone is also equipped\nwith a 2340 x 1080 FHD+ screen, 4GB of RAM and dual-cameras on both the front\n(24MP+2MP) and the rear (20MP+2MP) of the handset. All of this is powered by a\nsizeable 3750mAh battery, which can be charged by an 18W quick charger.\n\nThe Huawei Mate 20 Lite will be available to buy from £379 starting September\n5.\n\n**What do you think of Huawei’s lineup at this year’s show?
