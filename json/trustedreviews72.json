We’ve collected together everything you need to\nknow about the scandal, including responses from Facebook, Cambridge\nAnalytica, and the British government.**\n\n_**Last Updated (Thursday March 22):** Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s CEO, has\nfinally addressed the scandal for the first time. In a series of interviews on\nWednesday he addressed people’s concerns by promising that the platform would\nchange the ways third party developers could access and use Facebook profile\ndata. We’ve updated the article below with his pledges. _\n\nUnless you’ve been following the story since it first broke in December 2016,\nit can be easy to lose track of the dozens of different individuals and\ncompanies involved in the scandal. Depending on who you ask, this is a scandal\nabout Brexit, about the 2016 presidential election, about Russia, or about a\ncombination of all three.\n\nWe’ve broken down everything you need to know about the story, from the\nallegations against Cambridge Analytica, to Facebook’s response, and finally\nto who is in the wrong.\n\n**Related:[How to delete Facebook](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-\ndelete-facebook-account-2950145)**\n\n## What’s Cambridge Analytica supposed to have done?\n\nFundamentally, Cambridge Analytica is alleged to have misused the Facebook\ndata of up to 50 million users in its work to “change audience behavior”.\n\nHere’s how it happened, [according\nto](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/cambridge-analytica-facebook-\ninfluence-us-election) the Observer. While working at Cambridge University, a\npsychology lecturer called Aleksandr Kogan developed an app called\n‘thisisyourdigitallife’, which paid Facebook users to take a personality test.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nKogan’s company was called Global Science Research (GSR), and it was\nenormously successful at harvesting users’ data. The Observer claims that\n[320,000 people](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/data-war-\nwhistleblower-christopher-wylie-faceook-nix-bannon-trump) completed these\npersonality surveys, while\n[Facebook](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/03/suspending-cambridge-\nanalytica/)‘s estimation is slightly more conservative, at 270,000.\n\nBy downloading the app and completing Kogan’s tests, thisisyourdigitallife\nusers didn’t just hand over all of their Facebook data, but also that of their\nFacebook friends. On average, each person that completed a personality survey\non the app handed over the data of [160 Facebook users](http://192.168.1.1) −\n50 million altogether.\n\nOnce this data was collected, it’s then alleged that GSR sold it to Cambridge\nAnalytica’s parent company SCL.\n\nCambridge Analytica is then alleged to have used this data to target ads for\nboth the UK’s Brexit Leave campaign and Trump’s US election campaign — both of\nwhich had very effective social media strategies that put the most effective\nadverts in front of the most receptive users.\n\nBeyond this misuse of data, Channel 4’s documentary alleges that the company\nboasted of a number of other unethical services it could offer, including\nentrapping political rivals by sending girls round to their homes and filming\nit, or offering them bribes.\n\n**Related:[Watch Channel 4’s Cambridge Analytica report\nhere](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/cambridge-analytica-uncovered-\nchannel-4-watch-online-3428542)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAlexander Nix, Cambridge Analytica’s CEO\n\n## Was this illegal?\n\nAlthough Cambridge Analytica’s work has been described as “grossly unethical”,\nit’s how the company came to obtain this information that’s the focus of the\ncurrent scandal.\n\nMany of the Facebook users who downloaded Kogan’s app would have believed\ntheir data was to be used by GSR for academic purposes. Others might not have\nrealised their data would be collected at all.\n\nIf GSR then turned around and sold this data to SCL, then it would have been\nusing the data for purposes other than what was originally said to users,\nwhich would have broken data protection rules.\n\nFacebook, meanwhile, is adamant that Kogan violated its platform policies “by\npassing information on” to third parties.\n\nKogan is claiming that he’s being unjustly blamed by both Facebook and\nCambridge Analytica. In an interview with Radio 4’s Today programme he said\nthat he thought he was being used as a “scapegoat” by the companies, and\nclaimed that Cambridge Analytica approached him for the data and assured him\nthe data collection was completely legal and routine.\n\n## Has Facebook done anything wrong?\n\nFacebook’s entire business model is based advertising and data. The reason\nit’s such a successful service is, firstly, its users tend to spend a lot of\ntime on the platform (meaning more time spent looking at adverts), but also\nthat it has a lot of information on each of its members.\n\nIt’s this treasure trove of information that Facebook has collected over the\nyears, which allows the social network to make so much money from advertisers.\nAfter all, no company wants to spend money advertising nappies to people who\ndon’t have children, and Facebook’s advantage is that it can offer companies\nvery specific ad targeting.\n\n![William Iven \\(@firmbee\\) /\nUnsplash](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nRegarding the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook insists it hasn’t been\nhacked and its security systems haven’t been breached. In fact, it has\nclarified that Kogan gained access to Facebook users’ details in a perfectly\nlegitimate way.\n\nHowever, the company says it’s what Kogan did next − allegedly selling the\ndata on to Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie − that broke its rules.\nFacebook says it subsequently demanded that Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and\nWylie destroy the information.\n\nHowever, a Cambridge Analytica employee who claims to have been contacted\nabout this by Facebook’s lawyers alleges that the social networking firm made\nno effort to ensure that the data was actually deleted in the end.\n\nThere are also claims that Facebook downplayed reports of the incident to\nregulators.\n\nDespite the ambiguities, a large backlash to the social media giant has now\nformed. The hashtag ‘#deletefacebook’ started trending on Twitter on Monday\n19th March, and the company’s share price has taken a big hit as a result of\nof the report.\n\n## Does this have anything to do with Russia?\n\nThroughout all of these news reports, the spectre of Russian interference in\nthe American election and the Brexit vote looms. However, the new allegations\ndon’t include any concrete evidence that Russia was involved in the data\nanalytics work. Instead, what we’ve been offered are a number of tangential\nconnections.\n\nThe psychology lecturer behind the ‘thisisyourdigitallife’ app, Aleksandr\nKogan, is an associate professor at St Petersburg State University, and has\nreceived grants from the Russian government. Kogan has claimed that any\naccusations he is linked to the Kremlin are ‘laughable’.\n\nElsewhere, it’s been alleged that Cambridge Analytica pitched for work with\nLukoil, Russia’s second biggest oil producer, which has links to Putin.\nHowever, it does not appear that it ended up completing any work for them.\n\nAt the moment it seems that while there could be Russian element to the story,\nit’s by no means concrete.\n\n**Related:[How to stop apps from accessing to your Facebook\ndata](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/facebook-apps-settings-cambridge-\nanalytica-3428637)**\n\n## How has Facebook responded?\n\nIn a series of interviews as well as a blog post, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg\nexpressed regret that the data misuse had occurred and promised that the rules\naround third-party access to Facebook data would be changed.\n\nFor example, developers will no longer be able to access the data of inactive\nusers, and will only get access to the names, profile photos and email\naddresses of users who do choose to give the data. The platform will also make\nit easier for users to revoke app access to their data.\n\nHowever he also said that since Kogan’s app harvested this data, Facebook’s\nrules have already changed to prevent harvesting of this scale. Zuckerberg\ncalled this one of “the most important steps”.\n\nAdditionally, the company\n[suspended](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/03/suspending-cambridge-\nanalytica/) Cambridge Analytica and SCL from the platform.\n\nFacebook has categorically denied that this constitutes a “breach”, as the\ndata was handed over by users voluntarily and no systems were infiltrated, but\nthat hasn’t stopped the company’s share price from tumbling by around 10% over\nthe course of the crisis.\n\n## How has Cambridge Analytica responded?\n\nFor its part, Cambridge Analytica has said that [has not ever had or used\nprivate](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/cambridge-analytica-\nfacebook-influence-us-election) Facebook data. The company’s former CEO\nAlexander Nix made these statements to the British government’s parliamentary\ninquiry on fake news.\n\nHe said that the company had a relationship with GSR, but that none of the its\ndata came from that source.\n\nHowever, as a result of the scandal, and the comments Nix was recorded as\nsaying in Channel 4’s investigative report, the CEO has now been suspended\nfrom the company. However the company has still not admitted to any\nwrongdoing.\n\nThe Observer’s piece\n[claims](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/cambridge-analytica-\nfacebook-influence-us-election) that its journalists have seen evidence that\nCambridge Analytica did in fact have the Facebook data of 50 million users.\nThis evidence reportedly includes a letter sent from Facebook to a Cambridge\nAnalytica employee telling him to delete the data, and directly contradicts\nthe company’s official position.\n\nIn a [blog post on Monday](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/03/forensic-\naudits-cambridge-analytica/), Facebook said it had hired an independent\nauditor, digital forensics firm Stroz Friedberg, to discover whether the data\nhas actually been deleted by Cambridge Analytica.\n\nFacebook wrote: “If this data still exists, it would be a grave violation of\nFacebook’s policies and an unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments\nthese groups made. We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of\nthese claims.”\n\n## How has the British government responded?\n\nFor its part, the British government has expressed its concern,\n[summoned](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/20/officials-seek-\nwarrant-to-enter-cambridge-analytica-hq) Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to\nappear before a committee investigating fake news, and thrown its weight\nbehind an ongoing investigation by the Information Commissioner’s Office\n(ICO).\n\nPoliticians appear to be concerned that Facebook has not been straight with\nthem about the risks of companies acquiring and using its users’ data. In\nlanguage befitting a teacher scolding a student, Damian Collins MP wrote, “It\nis now time to hear from a senior Facebook executive with the sufficient\nauthority to give an accurate account of this catastrophic failure of\nprocess…Given your commitment at the start of the new year to ‘fixing’\nFacebook, I hope that this representative will be you.”\n\nThe ICO is currently [seeking a warrant](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-\nnews/2018/mar/20/officials-seek-warrant-to-enter-cambridge-analytica-hq) to\nenter Cambridge Analytica’s London HQ. If the claims made in The Observer’s\ninvestigation are correct, then Cambridge Analytica may have already misled\nMPs during their fake news investigation, making it especially important to\nfind hard evidence of what the firm has been up to.\n\nAdditionally, the ICO has ordered Facebook to cease its audit of Cambridge\nAnalytica in case this process impedes the ICO’s investigation.\n\nCambridge University has also announced [its own\ninvestigation](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/20/cambridge-\nuniversity-asks-facebook-for-evidence-about-role-of-academic-alex-kogan) into\npsychology lecturer Aleksandr Kogan, who is alleged to have originally put\ntogether the Facebook app that harvested people’s data. He has not, however,\nbeen suspended from his role at the university.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## What does this mean for your data?\n\nTo a certain extent, the damage has already been done. The offending Facebook\napp was removed from the platform back in 2015, meaning that all the data it\ncould access has been hoovered up already.\n\nUsing Facebook inevitably involves sacrificing some of your privacy. Every one\nof your Facebook ‘Likes’ helps to build a profile of you as a consumer, which\ncompanies can then use to advertise to you.\n\nBut in order to prevent the kinds of data harvesting that GSR conducted, you\nshould avoid giving any apps access to your Facebook data, because it appears\nthere’s no guarantee of what it might end up being used for — even if the app\nitself is backed by researchers at established universities.\n\nThe impact of these revelations is only just starting to be felt, but it’s\nclear that big changes in the law are going to be needed if this sort of thing\nis going to be prevented from happening again in the future.\n\n**Do you think it’s ethical for a company to use your Facebook data to\neffectively advertise political parties?
