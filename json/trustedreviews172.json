Yes, you. But luckily, this is going to be one of\nthose rare times when reading something will actually give you more time,\nrather than less. Meet IFTTT and 35 amazingly useful little recipes that will\nhelp you simplify your chaotic life.**\n\nThere’s a whole load of ways you could be automating the dullest everyday\ntasks and optimising your workflows to make the most of your precious time on\nthe earth.\n\n[IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) is short for If This Then That. It’s a service\ndesigned – albeit not with the lofty goal of making the most of your time on\nearth – to make it easy to carry out a whole range of tasks via its automated\nor on-demand service.\n\nThe main IFTTT service is for automatic actions – things that you want to\nhappen every time certain conditions are met without you needing to do\nanything. These trigger > action relationships used to be called ‘recipes’,\nbut IFTTT recently [renamed them\n‘applets’](http://A%20quick%20guide%20to%20IFTTT%20applets). We’re going to\ncall them recipes for the sake of this article, given that’s what most people\nare used to.\n\nAs IFTTT is just for automated actions, there’s also another app called DO for\none-off actions that you might like to repeat – like [automatically asking a\nspecific Slack channel](https://ifttt.com/recipes/192056-ask-a-slack-channel-\nif-they-want-coffee-too) or user if they want coffee as you approach the\noffice.\n\nThese are also called recipes, but are marked in IFTTT’s repository as ‘DO’.\n(You could also just use an IFTTT recipe for this example, by [geo-fencing a\nlocation relative to your office](https://ifttt.com/recipes/177127-when-\nentering-or-exiting-an-area-post-to-a-slack-channel) and setting it to ask the\nsame question every time you enter that area.)\n\nAs Android is a more permissive mobile OS, some of the recipes here won’t work\nfor iOS devices. Where possible, we’ve included links to both.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Fortnite Guide: How to Complete the Fortnitemares Challenges\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/fortnite-guide-complete-fortnitemares-\nchallenges-3610226 \"Fortnite Guide: How to Complete the Fortnitemares\nChallenges\")\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Google Assistant’s new Roomba trick could allow Google map your home\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-assistant-irobot-roomba-3613603\n\"Google Assistant’s new Roomba trick could allow Google map your home\")\n\n  *   * [ ![uncharted lost legacy](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Best PS4 Games 2018: All the top titles that belong in your library\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-ps4-games-3431751 \"Best PS4 Games\n2018: All the top titles that belong in your library\")\n\n  * \n\n**Related:[Nest vs Hive: Which is the best smart\nthermostat?](http://A%20quick%20guide%20to%20IFTTT%20applets) **\n\n## How to automate your home with IFTTT  \n\n**Nest**\n\n![IFTTT recipes\n7](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nNest might not be the startup darling of the tech scene it once was, but with\na range of smart products that can all communicate together and an open API to\nintegrate with other third-party devices, it’s one of the companies you should\nbe considering if you want to automate your home.\n\nThere are (literally) hundreds of different recipes available for Nest devices\non IFTTT, depending on what you want to do and what kit you have, but here are\nthree essentials.\n\nThink you forgot to turn off your lights when you left for your trip?

If you’re in the UK, you’ll be\nsetting that to a peachy 21ºC. If you’re in warmer climes, you’ll probably\nappreciate a blast of the air conditioning for 15 minutes without having to\nfaff around **:**\n\n  * **[DO]**[Set the temperature to X with a single press](https://ifttt.com/recipes/226636-set-your-nest-thermostat-to-___) / [Switch on your fan for 15 mins](https://ifttt.com/recipes/257271-turn-on-fan-for-15min)\n\n**  \nPhilips Hue**\n\n****![IFTTT\nrecipes](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)**  \n**\n\nIf you’re a Philips Hue user there are heaps of recipes you’ll want to\nexplore. Obvious ones are like [turning\non](https://ifttt.com/recipes/133323-turn-on-your-philips-hue-lights-when-you-\nget-home) your lights when you come home and [turning them off as you\nleave](https://ifttt.com/recipes/133322-turn-off-your-lights-when-you-leave-\nhome) are a starting point, but there are more adventurous uses, too.\n\nYou can easily set your Hue to a specific colour or to blink if you’re tagged\nin a Facebook photo or receive a message, for example:\n\n  * **[IFTTT]** Social media addict? Blink your lights when you’re [tagged in a photo](https://ifttt.com/recipes/93262-flash-your-lights-when-you-re-tagged-in-a-new-facebook-photo) or [receive a message](https://ifttt.com/recipes/134815-if-facebook-message-is-received-blink-hue-lights)\n\nSometimes you don’t want a loud, intrusive timer going off, and when those\nmoments strike, you can blink your lights instead with this recipe:\n\n  * **[IFTTT]** [Blink your lights when your Amazon Alexa/Echo timer gets to zero](http://.%20https//ifttt.com/recipes/303614-when-amazon-echo-alexa-timer-hits-0-blink-hue-lights)\n\nWith the press of a button, you can also make your Hue bulbs go through a full\nloop of their colour range **:**\n\n  * **[DO]**[Insta-party](https://ifttt.com/recipes/227082-make-your-hues-dance-at-the-party)\n\n**  \nSmartThings**\n\n![IFTTT recipes\n5](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nIf you’ve got a [Samsung SmartThings](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-\nsmartthings-review) box hooking up all your connected home devices, there are\na few handy recipes you might want to check out. Note that all of these\nrequire additional third-party hardware.\n\nIf you’ve got a [smart moisture\ndetector](https://support.smartthings.com/hc/en-\nus/articles/202847044-SmartSense-Moisture-Sensor), you can set SmartThings to\ntrigger an alert call if it ever detects a potential leak at home:\n\n  * **[IFTTT]**[Help, it’s wet in here!](https://ifttt.com/recipes/156899-get-a-phone-call-if-smartthings-detects-moisture)\n\nIf you’ve got an app-activated smart lock and use the Automatic app in your\ncar, you can set your front door to unlock when you park-up in a specific spot\n– at home would be the obvious place:\n\n  * **[IFTTT]**[Unlock your front door when you get home](https://ifttt.com/recipes/205033-unlock-your-front-door-when-you-arrive-home)\n\nHow useful this one is depends on how you use it, it’ll turn your selected\nswitch on or off.

If\nyou’re one of those happy Fitbit product owners and you’re not using IFTTT\nalready, you’re missing out.\n\nFor instance, if you just can’t get along with the Fitbit app, then this is\nall you need to keep your data in sync on Jawbone’s UP app instead:\n\n  * **[** **IFTTT** **]** [Log Fitbit activity to Jawbone UP app](https://ifttt.com/recipes/176243-log-fitbit-activities-to-jawbone-up)\n\nNever again curse yourself for forgetting to update your weight in Fitbit:\n\n  * **[** **IFTTT** **]** [Update Fitbit Weight when you weigh yourself on a Withings Scale](https://ifttt.com/recipes/176141-update-your-weight-on-fitbit-when-you-weigh-yourself-on-your-withings-scale)\n\nUse these recipes to be woken up either via a phone call or by flashing your\nlights once you’ve had a preset amount of sleep. You’ve got two options here,\ndepending on what hardware you have:\n\n  * **[IFTTT]**[Wakey](https://ifttt.com/recipes/176180-once-i-ve-slept-enough-turn-on-my-bedroom-light)/[wakey](https://ifttt.com/recipes/284363-if-i-sleep-for-too-long-call-and-wake-me-up)!\n\n**Nike**\n\n**![IFTTT\nrecipes](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \n**\n\nNike ‘s IFTTT channel has a load of different recipes to check out (as well as\nyour own to make), but here are three of the more fun ones that go beyond\ntracking and logging.\n\nIf you want to make your fitness prowess known to all, set your lights to\nflash when you hit your goals. You’ll need a Philips Hue hardware setup,\nobviously:\n\n  * **[IFTTT]** [Turn your Hue lights green when you hit your daily goal](https://ifttt.com/recipes/183600-lights-go-green-with-nikefuel-when-you-reach-today-s-goal)\n\nIf you use Qapital’s money-saving app, you can turn every run into a way to\nput some money away for rainy days. Or really indulgent days.\n\nYou could combine this with [a recipe to penalise yourself for missing your\ngoal](https://ifttt.com/recipes/434892-penalize-yourself-for-missing-your-\ndaily-fuel-goal) too, which would make every run a ‘win’ **:  \n**\n\n  * **[IFTTT]**[Save money when you hit your distance goal](https://ifttt.com/recipes/291919-reward-your-tired-feet-when-you-reach-your-distance-goal)\n\n****\n\nGoogle Docs\n\n![IFTTT recipes\n4](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nIt might seem an odd choice for a ‘health and fitness’ section, but for anyone\nreally dedicated to tracking their progress, linking up IFTTT with Google Docs\nis a no-brainer.\n\nThis one is simple.
