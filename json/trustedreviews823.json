There are already hundreds of examples of wireless charging pads\nalready out there from a host of manufacturers including Samsung and Belkin.\n\nDepending on the supported device you’re trying to charge wirelessly it’ll\nlikely adhere to one of two of the most common wireless charging standards out\nthere, PMA or Qi. In the case of the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X, all\nthree devices charge wirelessly via standard Qi charging.\n\nPower is transferred from the charging pad to the battery in the phone by way\nof alternating electromagnetic induction, using coils that are designed to\nemit and receive electromagnetic waves in both the charger and the handset\nrespectively.\n\n## Which devices are compatible with AirPower?\n\nApple’s AirPower mat is a little bit different to a standard wireless charger,\nwhich can typically only accommodate a single device at a time. Apple’s\nsolution aims to deliver on the promise of being able to throw your device\nanywhere on the mat and guarantee that it’ll start charging wirelessly. What’s\nmore, as seen in the first product images for the AirPower mat last year,\nyou’ll be able to charge multiple devices simultaneously in seemingly any\norientation – thanks to the fact that it supposedly contains 22 individual\ncharging coils.\n\nAssuming the AirPower mat still relies on Qi charging, which would make sense\nbased on the iPhone X’s current wireless charging compatibility, it’ll likely\nsupport the iPhone X, forthcoming [iPhone\n9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-9-release-date-3297160), iPhone\nXS and iPhone XS Max, any iteration of Apple Watch and the company’s wireless\nearphones, AirPods, provided they’re housed in the still-unreleased wireless\ncharging-compatible case.\n\nThere’s every chance that if it is a Qi-based charger, any other device that\nsupports the standard, like the [Samsung Galaxy\nS9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9), will also be\nable to charge on Apple’s charger.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n## When will the first AirPower mat be available?\n\nConsidering Apple first showed its AirPower mat off last year, many have been\nleft wondering (us included) why it’s taken the company so long to get it onto\nstore shelves.\n\nReports suggest that the technical challenges associated with making a multi-\ndevice wireless charging pad that can charge in any position aren’t trivial.\nOverheating has been a serious issue during AirPower’s development and it’s\napparently the reason the prototype version now supposedly possesses 22\ncharging coils that can be controlled to deliver power independently. What’s\nmore Apple’s gone so far as to integrate its own [custom\nchip](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-21/why-apple-s-airpower-\nwireless-charger-is-taking-so-long-to-make) running a modified version of iOS,\nwith a focus on some advanced form of power management.\n\nWhile Apple is yet to dish out an official launch date is still unclear but\nwith the impending iPhone XS launch event on September 12, we’re keeping\neverything cross that we’ll find out when AirPower will be available too. The\nfact that it’s still featured on Apple’s website also gives us hope that the\ncompany hasn’t just decided to cut its losses and throw in the towel.\n\n**Read more:[Best smartphone](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nsmartphone-3431175)**\n\n## How much will the Apple AirPower mat cost?\n\nAs for pricing, based on everything we’ve talked about, it’s likely to be\nexpensive. With that custom coil architecture, custom chipset, tweaked version\nof iOS, custom power management and the simple fact that it’s a first-party\nApple accessory, it’s unlikely to sit beneath the £100/$100 mark.\n\nApple currently offers the likes of Belkin’s Boost Up wireless charging pad\nfor around £60/$60, but that’s a standard 7.5W single-pad charger. [Early\nreports](http://www.chongdiantou.com/wp/archives/26814.html) suggest that the\nAirPower mat will cost closer to $150/£130.\n\n**Are you excited about Apple AirPower?
