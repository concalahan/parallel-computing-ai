Looking similar to the[Hive View indoor\ncamera](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/hive-view), the Outdoor is\nanother stylish cubic camera.**\n\nInstallation is designed to be easy, with the camera attaching to a magnetic\nmount, in much the same way as the [Nest Cam\nOutdoor](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nest-cam-outdoor). An anti-\ntheft mechanism makes the camera hard to remove from its mount.\n\nUsing a magnetic mount is a good move, as it makes it easier to point the\ncamera where you want it.\n\nFor those that don’t want to self-install, customers can purchase a\nprofessional installation.\n\nInternally, the Hive Outdoor uses the same Full HD internals as the indoor\ncamera. There’s a 130-degree lens for wide-angle capture and built-in IR LEDs\nfor night vision.\n\nThe camera is controlled through the Hive app and can control additional\ndevices through Hive Actions. For example, linking [Hive\nLights](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/hive-active-light) to the Hive\nView Outdoor can simulate occupancy when you’re away to put off burglars.\n\nIt demonstrates how much the Hive ecosystem has grown, with the company now\ncombining home security, smart lighting and, with [Hive Active\nHeating](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/hive-active-heating-2), home\ncomfort.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nTwo-way audio is available with the camera so that you can warn off would-be\nthieves. And, if you don’t want to talk, you can play pre-defined sounds,\nincluding a dog barking and a siren.\n\nFree cloud storage is available for 24-hours, although any clips can be\ndownloaded and saved to a smartphone. If you want more cloud storage, you can\nupgrade to the paid-for Hive Video Playback Membership, which gets you 30-days\nof storage.\n\nThe Hive View Outdoor is available for pre-order now and will launch in early\nDecember, with pricing starting at £179.\n\n**Are you tempted by the Hive View Outdoor?
