Latency, or lag, isthe time it takes for the item you’re trying to download to actually startdownloading. For instance, when you press play on Netflix, there’s a veryshort delay before the content begins to stream to your device.Latency will be very familiar to gamers, where the concept can have a far moresignificant impact. When you perform an action in a multiplayer game, the lagis the delay between you hitting a button on your keyboard and the game serveractually receiving that command. So 5G on mobile will hugely improve latency –possibly to the point where serious online gaming using your phone connectionwould become a reality.There are obvious advantages for consumer use, but the implications for the‘internet of things’ could end up being far more profound. Driverless carscurrently do all of their processing on-board, but the low latency allowed by5G could mean that essential information could be quickly transmitted in orderto prevent accidents.## When will 5G actually launch in the UK?In the UK, 5G is expected to see a widespread rollout by 2020 and it lookslike we’re progressing towards this milestone very nicely. ‘Release 16’ of the5G standard is due to be revealed in December , which paves the way foroperators to start delivering the service to customers next year. In fact, allof the major UK mobile networks have revealed their 5G testing plans, and mostare saying they’ll be ready to launch in 2019.However, while it won’t surprise you to hear that the mobile networks aregetting very competitive with their rollouts, it’s important to note thatwhatever ends up being released first is likely to offer a fraction of thefunctionality of what 5G will eventually be capable of. All that matters iswhether buying a new handset too early will lock you out of new features whenthey’re eventually released, and for that we’ll have to wait and see whathappens in 2019 and beyond.Still, from all these developments, it’s clear that each major provider istreating 5G very seriously indeed – and that’s ultimately going to be goodnews for consumers itching to stream Netflix that little bit faster.Just don’t hold your breath for it happening just yet.**How do you think 5G will change the world?
