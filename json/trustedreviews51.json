Here’s the skinny on this year’s event\nso far:\n\n## Computex 2017: What’s happened so far?\n\n**Gigabyte’s little and large gaming machines**\n\nGigabyte launched a few new products at Computex, but by far the most\ninteresting was the [Aorus X9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/aorus-x9-review\n\"Aorus X9\"), which is a behemoth dual-GTX 1070 laptop with a stunning design.\nThe company also announced its new [Brix\nGaming](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/gigabyte-brix-gaming-launch-specs\n\"gigabye Brix gaming\") PCs, which are small enough to chuck into your bag but\npowerful enough to play VR games.\n\n![Gigabyte Brix\ngaming](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Corsair wows with Concept desktops**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n###  Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nCorsair’s no stranger to producing classy, high-end PC cases, but the [Concept\nSlate and Concept Curve](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/corsair-concept-\nslate-wireless-charging-mouse \"Corsair Concepts\") desktops the company showed\noff at its booth were seriously impressive even by its standards. There was\nalso a weird wireless-charging mousemat. What’s not to like? **  \n**\n\n**![Corsair Concept\nSlate](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)**\n\n**MSI bucks the gaming laptop trend  \n**\n\nMSI went in its own direction at Computex, launching the huge [GT75VR\nTitan](https://www.trustedreviews.com/msi-gt75vr-titan-review \"GT75 Titan\")\nlaptop. Specced up with an overclockable CPU and GPU, it’s a mighty impressive\nmachine that weighs a metaphorical tonne. **  \n**\n\n**![MSI GT75VR\nTitan](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)**\n\n**Qualcomm chips come to Windows**\n\nARM-powered Windows laptops are nearly here, with [Qualcomm and Microsoft\nannouncing](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/windows-10-qualcomm-\nsnapdragon-835-arm-chips \"Snapdragon 835 windows 10\") the chipmaker’s flagship\nSnapdragon 835 platform will be integerated into upcoming Windows 10 laptops.\n**  \n**\n\n**AMD asks us to wait  \n**\n\n2017’s been a good year so far for AMD, but unlike its 2016 Computex\nconference, we didn’t get much in the way of new products or exciting news.\nSlow and steady is good, sure, but it would have been nice to see a new\ngraphics card launch. Instead, the firm will launch its new [RX\nVega](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/amd-vega-specs-performance-release-\ndate-technology-explained \"AMD Vega\") gaming card at the end of July.\n\nThere was more news, too. It was confirmed that the company’s unlaunched quad-\ncore Ryzen 3 CPUs would be certified Oculus Rift-compatible, as if there was\nany doubt. The company also showed off its gigantic ThreadRipper desktop CPU\nin the flesh. It’s definitely quite big. **  \n**\n\n**![ThreadRipper\nmotherboards](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \n**\n\nFinally, the company showed off a 2-in-1 laptop powered by [Ryzen\nMobile](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/amd-ryzen-mobile-laptops-vega-\nperformance-price-release-date \"Ryzen Mobile\"), the as-yet unspecified laptop-\nspecific APU that’ll ship later this year. It looked very thin and light and\nAMD showed proof it was legit by playing a video on it, but without specifics,\nall we can really see is a pre-production laptop. Still, it gives me hope that\nRyzen Mobile laptops will be as thin and light as Intel-powered machines, and\nmaybe even more powerful. The firm also showed off five Ryzen desktop PCs from\nAcer, Lenovo, Asus, Dell and HP to reaffirm how strong its partnerships with\neach company really is.\n\n![Ryzen Mobile\nlaptop](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Zotac goes big  \n**\n\nMini PC maker [Zotac launched a new range of slightly larger\nPCs](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/zotac-mini-pcs-ryzen-gtx-1050 \"zotac\nMek\"), called MEK. They’re tall, thin and they look a little bit like cyclops\nrobots.\n\n**![Zotac\nMEK](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)**\n\n**Dell launches new desktops**\n\nNot to be outdone, [Dell’s launched a few notable new\nproducts](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/dell-unveils-three-new-amd-\npowered-inspiron-desktops \"Dell inspiron computex\"). There’s a pair of all-in-\none PCs, both of which come with AMD 7th-gen processors, as well as the\nInspiron Gaming Desktop, which comes with the latest AMD Ryzen chips and a\nchoice of Nvidia or AMD GPUs.\n\n![Dell Inspiron\ngaming](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Acer launches massive curved monitor  \n**\n\nAs expected, Acer had a quiet Computex. The company is here, and I’ve seen\ntheir booth. But the only new product is a new 35-inch curved gaming monitor.\nNo doubt the Predator Z35P is a lovely piece of kit, with a 3440 x 1440-pixel\npanel, Nvidia G-Sync, a pair of 9W speakers and decent colours. It can even\nrefresh at 100Hz for super-smooth gaming. **  \n**\n\n**![Acer\nZ35P](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)**\n\n**Core blimey! Intel Core i9 revealed**\n\nIntel’s only gone and launched a desktop processor with 18 cores, along with a\nload more chips ranging from Core i5 all the way up to the brand-new [Core i9\nmodel](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/intel-core-i9-specs-release-date-\nskylake-x \"Intel Core i9\").\n\n**Asus second press conference: Buckets of gaming gear**\n\nAsus just held its second press conference of the week, this time for its\nRepublic of Gamers brand. I’m still working my way through the announcements,\nbut the biggest was the reveal of the [ROG\nZephyrus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/asus-rog-zephyrus-review \"Asus ROG\nZephyrus\"), one of the most incredible gaming laptops I’ve seen.\n\n![Asus ROG\nZephyr](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe company also launched the [world’s first Ryzen\nlaptop](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/asus-rog-strix-first-ryzen-laptop\n\"Asus ROG Strix\").\n\n**Nvidia unveils new Max-Q gaming laptop standard**\n\nNvidia used its Computex press conference to launch the new\n[Max-Q](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/nvidia-max-q-laptops-thin-and-\nlight-gaming \"Nvidia Max-Q\") gaming laptop standard – set to be used by most\nof the world’s gaming laptop manufacturers.\n\nThe standard lays out specifications for design and internal hardware, and has\nbeen conceived to balance performance and battery life. Essentially, Max-Q\nlaptops must have a thickness of less than 18mm and a weight of under 5lbs, or\nabout 2.1kg.\n\nOn top of that, manufacturers have to keep fan noise below 40dBA, which can be\ndone using advanced cooling and newly developed, highly-efficient electrical\ndesigns.\n\n![Nvidia\nMax-Q](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nBut perhaps the most interesting Max-Q requirement is a [GTX\n1080](https://www.trustedreviews.com/nvidia-geforce-gtx-1080-review \"GTX 1080\nreview\") GPU. Considering the specification requires a thin and light design,\nthat means we’ll be seeing some incredibly capable gaming laptops that remain\nportable. Max-Q laptops can also come equipped with GTX 1070s and 1060s.\n\nComputex should yield several Max-Q laptops as all the big gaming laptop\ncompanies try to get in on the action so stay tuned. Nvidia expects widespread\navailability from June 17.\n\n**First Asus press conference, three new laptops announced  \n**\n\nWhile I was in the air, making my way to Taipei, Asus jump-started the show by\nlaunching a bunch of new ZenBook and VivoBook devices.\n\nAsus Chairman Jonney Shi lead proceedings.\n\nThere were four key announcements that are entirely new products. The Intel\nCore i7-7700HQ-powered [ZenBook\nPro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/nvidia-max-q-laptops-thin-and-light-\ngaming \"ZenBook Pro\") leads the pack, with specifications that are set to\nrival the likes of the [Dell XPS 15](https://www.trustedreviews.com/dell-\nxps-15-review \"Dell Inspiron 15 Gaming review\"). There’s an Nvidia GeForce GTX\n1050 Ti on-board, along with up to a 1TB PCIe SSD and 16GB DDR4 RAM.\n\nShih also debuted the world’s thinnest convertible [ZenBook Flip\nS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/asus-zenbook-flip-s-review \"ZenBook Flip\nS\"), which comes with a 4K display. At 10.9mm thick and weighing 1.1kg, and\npacking a 7th Generation Intel Core i7-7500U processor and a super-quick 1TB\nPCIe SSD, the Flip S is entering into a competitive market, where the likes of\nthe HP Spectre x360 and Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 have a bit of a headstart.\n\n![Asus Computex\n2017](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAsus also took the opportunity to launch a new VivoBook Pro 15, which comes\nwith Intel’s seventh-generation processors and Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1050.\nMeanwhile, the VivoBook S15 isn’t quite as powerful, but there’s still an\nNvidia GeForce GTX 940 chip on-board. The company also reintroduced the\n[ZenBook 3 Deluxe](https://www.trustedreviews.com/asus-zenbook-3-deluxe-review\n\"Asus ZenBook 3 Deluxe\") that I saw at CES\n\n**Watch: Laptop buying guide**\n\nWhat are you hoping to see at Computex 2017?
