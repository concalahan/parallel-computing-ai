Google has confirmed a\nmajor product launch event for October 4, 2017, which is almost certainly\ngoing to host the Google pixel 2 debut.\n\nThat’s in contrast to early rumours that pegged the Pixel 2 to launch on\nOctober 5, with respected mobile tipster Evan Blass (aka @evleaks)\n[tweeting](https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/900527086322032640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.trustedreviews.com%2Fnews%2Fnew-\npixel-2-leak-confirms-october-release-date-snapdragon-836-soc-3269663):\n\n> Google's second-generation Pixel handsets, powered by Snapdragon 836 SoC's,\nwill be unveiled on October 5th.\n\n>\n\n> — Evan Blass (@evleaks) [August 24,\n2017](https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/900527086322032640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nHowever, a separate leak did suggest that the Pixel 2 would be launching\napproximately 24 hours earlier. That was based on a billboard ad in Boston, MA\n([via](http://www.droid-life.com/2017/09/13/google-pixel-2-event-date/)\n_DroidLife_ ), which implored smartphone users to “Ask more of your phone”\nfrom October 4. That’s the same date as Google’s 2016 Pixel event, so there\ncould well be some mileage in this spot.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIn any case, Google has confirmed that the phone will be coming later this\nyear. Speaking to Android Pit, Rick Osterloh, who heads up Google’s hardware\ndivision, admitted the Pixel series wasn’t just an experiment, saying: “There\nis an annual rhythm in the industry. So, you can count on us to follow it. You\ncan count on a successor this year, even if you don’t hear a date from me\nnow.”\n\nExcitingly, it’s also rumoured that Google might be using the Pixel 2 launch\nevent to debut a new, ready-for-release standalone VR headset built in\npartnership with both HTC and Qualcomm. Read all about it over at our [HTC\nVive Focus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/htc-vive-focus-release-date-\nspecs-features-price-uk-3292348) hub page.\n\nFinally, a report written in late September by Android Authority cited\nanonymous insider sources as saying that the Pixel 2 XL will have a near-all-\nscreen front. It’s expected that the phone will have a screen-to-body ratio of\nbetween 80% and 85%, which would put it on par with the Samsung Galaxy Note 8.\n\nSo what on earth is going on? Read on for more.\n\n## Google Pixel 2: What we (think) we know\n\nWe’ve been hearing for a long while that Google’s next smartphones are coming\nlater this year, and are being developed under the codenames ‘Walleye’ and\n‘Taimen’. A third – ‘Muskie’ – was also tipped to be in development, but was\nreportedly scrapped. These two handsets are expected to be the successors to\n2016’s Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL, and will probably run on the new\nAndroid O software.\n\nAndroid hub XDA Developers recently published a new blog post that details a\nnumber of specifications about both Walleye and Taimen. The post reads: “XDA\nDevelopers has obtained information about both upcoming Google devices…from a\nsource familiar with the matter that spent time with at least one of these\nphones. We are confident in the validity of the details presented…given the\nsource’s track record.”\n\nOne of the biggest rumour so far revolves around one of our most requested\nPixel 2 features, and it seems the upcoming flagship will survive a dunk in\nthe bath. There’s also some predictable bits that have come out regarding the\nphone, including that it’ll sport a better camera, get a price bump and\npossibly be paired with a lower-priced version too.\n\nIt’s entirely possible that the details may change closer to the launch date,\nbut here’s a closer look at what’s rumoured.\n\n**Taimen Leak**\n\nFor Taimen, this report suggests that the phone will feature a sizeable\n5.99-inch display with a high-resolution 1440p OLED panel – that’s going to be\nbuilt by LG, apparently.\n\nThe phone is also tipped to feature a smaller bezel, and that there will be a\n128GB (with 4GB of RAM) model available, with the concession that there may be\nother storage variants offered too.\n\nWe’re also assured that Qualcomm’s latest and greatest [Snapdragon\n835](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/snapdragon-835-phones-processor-\nspecs-speed-benchmark-chipset-cores) processor will feature in the phone,\nwhich is the same chipset we’ve seen debut in the [Samsung Galaxy\nS8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-s8-review) and [HTC\nU11](https://www.trustedreviews.com/htc-u11-review).\n\nAs far as design goes, the back is said to be two-tone glass and metal,\nsimilar to what we saw last year. The device is also expected to feature a\nsingle camera with dual LED flash, rather than the dual camera that some had\nbeen expecting.\n\n**Walleye Leak**\n\nThe Walleye device is said to be smaller than Taimen, boasting a comparatively\ndinky 4.97-inch display with a Full HD 1080p resolution.\n\nThe design is prescribed as being “almost identical” to last year’s Google\nPixel, including the large(-ish) bezels. Google is said to be planning to drop\nthe headphone jack, but include stereo speakers.\n\nThis phone is also tipped to carry the Snapdragon 835 chip, paired with 4GB of\nRAM and 64GB of storage.\n\nDespite the leak, it’s worth taking all rumours with due caution, as we won’t\nknow the truth of the matter until Google makes an official announcement.\n\n## **Google Pixel 2 Release Date: When does the Pixel 2 come out?**\n\nGoogle has officially confirmed plans to host a press event on October 4,\nwhere we’re almost certain we’ll see the new Google Pixel 2 announced.\n\n## **Google Pixel 2 Price: How much will the Pixel 2 cost?**\n\n**Google Pixel** : _£599 (32GB) | £699 (128GB)_\n\n**Google Pixel XL:** £719 (32GB) | £819 (128GB)\n\nWe would expect the Google Pixel 2 to hit the price-points as above – we hope\nlower – though possibly with higher storage at lower prices.\n\n## Google Pixel 2 Preview: 5 things we want to see\n\nThe Google Pixel and Pixel XL are great, but we think there are obvious areas\nfor improvement. Here are five keys upgrades we’d love to see in the Google\nPixel 2 that would make it a real [iPhone\nX](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-x-release-date-specs-features-\nuk-price-2951157) rival.\n\n### 1\\. A more enticing starting price\n\nWe were spoiled with the Nexus series. High-end specs for a rock-bottom price\nwas always too good to be true, and now that Google is taking phones seriously\nit’s a different story.\n\nWhereas the [Nexus 6P](https://www.trustedreviews.com/nexus-6p-review) hit\nshelves for less than £500, the Pixel XL runs up to £819 if you want a beefy\namount of internal storage. It’s an iPhone-matching price that we’re just not\nsure Google is quite justified in charging yet.\n\nWe’d love if the Pixel 2 came in at a lower price, but maybe that’s asking too\nmuch just after Brexit.\n\n### 2\\. Improved base storage, or a microSD slot\n\nBoth Pixels currently offer either 32GB or 128GB of internal storage, but we’d\nlike to see that base jump to 64GB.  \nLike 16GB before it, 32GB is fast becoming redundant as 4K video files get\nbigger and mobile games become more ambitious. 32GB can easily be filled up\nwith a few Spotify playlists and a holiday’s worth of snaps.\n\nThings aren’t helped by the lack of expandable storage, which is pretty much\nthe norm on every other Android phone. 64GB seems a much fairer starting\npoint, and Google could always offer up an iPhone 7 matching 256GB model for\nthe media hoarders out there.\n\n![pixel\n15](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### 3\\. A more durable body\n\nUnlike many, we’re fans of the Google Pixel’s design. It’s not the thinnest\nnor the lightest, but it’s well built and manageable even if you plump for the\nlarger model. We have noticed though that the metal used seems very to scratch\nand dent very easily. Even without dropping our Pixel XL, the corners and\nsides have got increasingly dinged.\n\nConsidering its likely high starting price, it seems only right that Google\nshould improve its components and give us a much tougher device.\n\n### 4\\. Water resistance is a must\n\nThe Google Pixel matches, and in most cases supersedes, flagships from Sony,\nApple and Samsung in many areas but it’s still lacking something.\n\nA high IP rating (either IP67 or IP68) means you can dunk your phone in about\na metre of water without any actual damage, and it’s a feature the Google\nPixel 2 simply must have to compete with the Samsung Galaxy S8 and iPhone 7\n(or iPhone 7S/iPhone 8).\n\n### 5\\. Better audio throughout\n\nOne of the Pixels few shortcoming are its downward facing and rather tinny\nspeakers. Often a forgotten feature on phones – normally to save space – we\nlove good speakers and DACs on phones.\n\nThe HTC U11 has great audio, and it does make a big difference especially on\nmedia centric phones with large screens. Considering the current Pixel has a\nthick bezel running around the display, there should be enough room to jam in\nsome decent front-firing speakers. Oh, and keep the headphone jack. Cheers,\nGoogle.\n\n**What do you want to see in Google Pixel 2? Let us know in the comments\nbelow**\n\n"}
