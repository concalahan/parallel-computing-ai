The readout was first\nspotted by [Mobipicker](http://www.mobipicker.com/google-nexus-8-tablet-\nbenchmarked-may-come-soon-with-8-core-processor/).\n\nWhat’s interesting is that it’s actually not so mysterious after all – the\ndevice is conspicuously named as “Nexus 8”.\n\nThat’s not a device that currently exists amongst Google’s Nexus arsenal, but\nthe moniker does fit with the company’s naming convention.\n\nWhat’s more, last year we heard rumours that Google was working on a [Nexus 8\ntablet](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-nexus-8-still-en-route-\ndespite-i-o-silence). Instead, the company launched the tepidly-received\n[Nexus 9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/nexus-9-review).\n\nThis latest leak could be proof that a Nexus 8 tablet really does exist. But\nwhat will it look like?\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nWell the name is a dead giveaway for a start. As with previous Nexus devices,\nthe Nexus 8 – if it exists – will land with an 8-inch (-ish) screen.\n\nThe benchmark readout also gives us some clues as to what we can expect from\nthe device.\n\nFor instance, it’s listed as using an octa-core processor clocked at 1.3GHz.\nUnfortunately, we don’t know which exact chip features.\n\nThe device is also seemingly running on [Android\n5.1.1](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/android-5-1-features), however\nwe’d say it’s far more likely that a new Nexus tablet will actually ship with\n[Android 6.0 Marshmallow](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/android-m-\nfeatures).\n\nThat’s Google’s upcoming update to its mobile operating system, expected to\ndebut on new Nexus devices this autumn.\n\n**Related:[Best Tablet 2015](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-\ntablets_round-up)**\n\nThere’s little else we can extract from this latest leak, so we’ll just have\nto wait for an official unveiling from Google.\n\nIf the Nexus 8 does exist, it’s likely to land alongside the long-rumoured [LG\nNexus 5 (2015)](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-nexus-5-2015-release-\ndate-rumours-news-specs-and-price) and [Huawei Nexus 6\n(2015)](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/huawei-nexus-6-2015-release-date-\nrumours-news-specs-price).\n\nWould you like to see an 8-inch tablet from Google?
