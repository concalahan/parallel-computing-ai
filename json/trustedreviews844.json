We explain 144Hz\nmonitors and beyond, and why more hertz isn’t always better (but usually\nis).**\n\nFor years, the refresh rate has been the go-to number for gamers when buying a\nmonitor. But what exactly is refresh rate and how does it relate to other\naspects of monitor technology, such as panel type and response time? Read on\nto find out.  \n **  \n**\n\n## What is refresh rate?  \n\nThe refresh rate of a monitor is the speed (rate) at which the monitor’s image\nchanges (refreshes). The faster the refresh rate, the more times the image can\nupdate every second and the smoother the image will look. This number of\nchanges per second is measured in hertz (Hz).\n\nThe generally accepted level of refresh rate that leads to a satisfying image\ndepends on the application. Cinemas run at just 24Hz, while the old TV\nstandards of PAL and NTSC ran at 50Hz and 60Hz respectively. A typical PC\nmonitor will have a refresh rate of 60Hz, but the latest gaming displays can\nreach all the way to 240Hz.\n\n****\n\nThe pursuit of faster refresh rates is crucial for gaming, since it allows the\nscreen to keep up with the rapid movements of a player. For instance, a modern\nmouse can report its position up to 1000 times a second, while modern PCs can\nrun competitive games such as Counter-Strike: Global Offensive or Overwatch at\nhundreds of frames per second. Having a monitor that can keep up with all that\ncan potentially give a gamer that crucial split-second advantage.  \n**  \nRelated:[Best CPUs for gaming](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-cpu-for-\ngaming_round-up \"Best CPU for gaming\")**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n###  Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nHowever, there are diminishing returns. For a long time 144Hz was the _de\nfacto_ standard gaming monitor refresh rate (because it’s 6 x 24Hz) but now\nwe’re seeing 240Hz panels. We’re yet to review such ultra-fast panels, but\nearly verdicts suggest that only the most competitive of gamers will gain an\nadvantage. This compares to the leap from 60Hz to anything over 100Hz, which\neven fairly casual gamers will notice.\n\nMoreover, once you’ve reached such a level of refresh rate, other factors\nbecome more noticeable when it comes to trying to get the most clear image.\nFactors such as response time and motion blur.\n\n## Response time\n\nResponse time is the time it takes for a pixel to change from one colour to\nanother. Generally measured in milliseconds (ms), it’s directly related to\nrefresh rate in that a monitor can only really refresh its image quickly if\nthe pixels can respond quick enough. A 16ms response time translates to a\ntheoretical maximum of a 60Hz refresh rate 1s/60 = 16.6ms.\n\nResponse time is the reason that gaming monitors still use TN LCD panels with\npoor viewing angles, when most other monitors and LCD screens in phones,\ntablets and laptops have moved onto better technologies such as IPS and VA. TN\ncan respond as quickly as 1ms, whereas the fastest IPS screens are around 4ms\nand most are 8ms or longer.\n\nMeanwhile, response time is the big advantage that OLED displays have over LCD\npanel, and is the reason that many of us are so excited about them eventually\nbeing cheap enough to replace LCDs in computer monitors. LCDs work by\nphysically moving tiny crystals embedded in the surface of the screen, and so\nare relatively slow to respond. OLED displays, on the other hand, are purely\nelectronic, making them several orders of magnitude faster – a typical OLED\npanel has a response time of just 0.01ms.\n\n**When you’re done:[Read our best gaming monitor\nreviews](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-gaming-monitors_round-up \"Best\ngaming monitor\")**\n\nSomething to keep in mind when looking at monitor response times is there\nisn’t an accepted standard of measurement. It’s generally measured by a figure\ncalled grey-to-grey time, which refers to the time it takes for a pixel to\ntransition from grey to white and back again, rather than all the way from\nblack to white to black, which takes longer. But there isn’t a hard and fast\nstandard that defines this.\n\nAs such, you can sometimes end up with situations where the monitor may say it\nhas a 4ms response time, for instance, but it can look far slower than that.\nUnfortunately, there’s no way to really test for this other than to read\nreviews by people that have actually used the displays.\n\n## Motion Blur\n\nOne of the effects of having a slow refresh rate or response time is that an\nimage can look blurred. This can happen for a couple of different reasons.\n\nThe first is due to response time. With a slow response time, pixels can take\na while to fully transition from their previous state to their new one. This\ncan result in there being a trailing, or ghost, image behind the new one. The\nslower the pixels take to respond, the longer the trail and the less clear\nyour image.\n\nThis was a particular problem with the [AOC\nC3583FQ](https://www.trustedreviews.com/aoc-c3583fq-review), for instance. It\nhas a fast 160Hz refresh rate that initially, at least, means the image\nresponds quickly. However, the VA LCD panel’s slow response time meant that it\nhad very long, distracting trails that made the display feel nowhere near as\nresponsive as typical TN gaming panels.  \n **  \nRelated:[Best gaming PC specs to build\nyourself](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/best-gaming-pc \"Best Gaming\nPC\")**\n\nThe other type of motion blur is eye-tracking motion blur. This is where your\nbrain can perceive an image to be blurry because your eyes naturally track the\nmovement of an image on-screen, but because the image is actually static –\neven just for a fraction of a second – your eyes end up blurring the image as\nthey pan across it.\n\n![Blur\nBusters](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)_  \nYou can test motion blur for yourself at[Blur\nBusters](https://www.testufo.com/#test=framerates \"Blur Busters\")_\n\nThis can be reduced by having a faster refresh rate. However, of even more\nbenefit is a technique known as black-frame insertion. This is where a\ncompletely blank image is inserted in between each frame, reducing the time\nit’s displayed for and masking the effect of your eyes tracking the movement.\nIt effectively doubles the refresh rate, but without the need for any extra\nimage information, which is why it works when watching fixed-refresh rate\nvideo on TVs too.\n\n![V blank](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nHow this is achieved depends on the type of screen technology. OLED screens\ncan just turn on and off, but with LCDs it is the backlight that’s turned on\nand off instead.\n\nThe interesting thing about this effect is that it can be just as effective on\ndisplays with fast response times. That’s because it’s to do with how long the\nimage is displayed for, not how quickly it can change, which is why it’s still\neffective even on OLED displays that have super-fast response times.\n\nThat said, black-frame insertion does have a double advantage when it comes to\nLCDs, since it masks the ghosting effect of their slow response time.\n\n## So do you need a fast refresh rate?\n\nSo are fast refresh rate gaming monitors worth it? Absolutely. If you play\nfast-paced, competitive games, the responsive feel of a 100Hz+ monitor with a\nsub 4ms response time is undeniable and can bring a real competitive\nadvantage.\n\nBe honest with yourself, though. If you don’t actually play competitive multi-\nplayer games – particularly FPS – then you’re better off prioritising image\nquality over refresh rate and response time. Indeed, that’s why the likes of\nthe [Asus PG279Q](https://www.trustedreviews.com/asus-rog-swift-pg279q-review\n\"Asus PG279Q review\") and [Acer XF270HU](https://www.trustedreviews.com/acer-\nxf270hu-review \"Acer XF270HU review\") have proved so popular: they strike the\nperfect compromise between all these factors.\n\n"}
