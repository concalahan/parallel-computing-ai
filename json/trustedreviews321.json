{"result": 0, "title": "Samsung Galaxy Note 7 vs Google Nexus 6P: Which is best? | Trusted Reviews", "description": "![Note 7 vsNexus]()One difference worth noting, however, is that the Note 7 supports fastwireless charging, so you can drop it on a charging pad and expect a fairlyspeedy charge time – 98 minutes for a full charge. Regular wireless charging,in contrast, takes 300 minutes. You’ll need a specific charger from Samsung orone of a handful of other companies, though. The Nexus doesn’t have anywireless charging capabilities.## Galaxy Note 7 vs Nexus 6P – SummaryLet’s put this as plainly as possible: the Note 7 is the better phone. Butit’s also really expensive. The thing will cost you £749 outright, which justseems insane when you consider how many phones pack in decent hardware at afraction of the price these days. Unless you absolutely have to get your handson the S Pen, we’d recommend at least considering the Nexus 6P.Google’s device costs around £440, and will provide speedy performance, agreat screen, and an untouched version of Android. It’s also got a greatcamera that manages to give the Note 7, with its top-end camera specs, a runfor its money.With all that in mind it’s a tough one to call. If you don’t want to break thebank, the Nexus is the clear winner. If you have the cash, give the Note 7 ago.**WATCH: What’s the no.1 smartphone in the world?  ******Let us know in the comments which device you think clinches it.   ****"}
