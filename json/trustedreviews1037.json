If you’re not the greatestsniper on the planet, just grab a hunting rifle. It may not have the stoppingpower of sniper rifles, but it’s much easier to use, and you don’t lose sightof your surroundings when you aim down the sights.**Deal damage with pistols to opponents**Go to Salty Springs, grab a pistol (or silenced pistol), head to the bluehouse, then let rip on anyone you see. If you hate pistols, play a group gamemode and down someone, then switch to your pistol to finish them off. Itshould still count the damage and you won’t need to worry about missing yourshots as much.**SMG Eliminations**The SMGs are still fairly over-powered, which is great if you’re looking toblast through this challenge. If you can grab a P90, anyone within range willdrop like a sack of spuds. Failing that, the standard SMG still boasts enoughpower to drop most players at mid-to-close range. Just grab one then spray andpray.**Stage 1: Deal damage with hunting rifles to opponents**If you’re working on the 50m away challenge, it might be worth stacking thetwo together. Don’t worry too much about finding the right vantage point, andinstead focus on camping the top of the building or player-built structure.When you see someone, line up your shot carefully then fire. Just keep in mindthe trajectory of hunting rifles works more like an arrow than a bullet. Soaim slightly higher than where you’re aiming for if you’re firing from adistance.Or, like with the pistol damage challenge, down, switch, profit. Hey, if itworks, it works.**Stage 2: Deal damage with bolt-action rifles to opponents**Okay. So. If you know how to use a sniper you’ll be fine with this one. Find asniper perch, aim for the head, get the kill. If not, it’s recommended tostick to the cheesy tactic: Down a player, switch to the bolt-action, shootthem in the face.**Stage 3: Deal damage with heavy sniper rifles to opponents**Much like the suppressed AR challenge, the hardest part here will be findingit. The heavy sniper drops in both purple and gold variants, so don’t expectto find one the moment you load in. Land Salty or the corrupted zones for thehighest chest chances, and don’t forget you have the option to down anopponent then switch to the heavy to fire off some damage.  If you manage to find one, one headshot should drop most players. You canexpect this to take somewhere between one or two matches to complete.**Related:[Assassin’s Creed OdysseyReview](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/assassins-creed-odyssey)**As always, if you’ve got any burning questions about season 6, be sure tocheck out our [Fortnite Season 6hub](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/fortnite-season-6-news-update-skins-weapons-battle-pass-challenges-3505854).
