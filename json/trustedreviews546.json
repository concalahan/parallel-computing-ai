Here’s what you really need to know about\nDoro’s latest efforts, which are likely to be among the best elderly phones of\nthe year.**\n\nThe **Doro 7060** is the company’s new ‘smart’ feature phone, which is\nintended as a “stepping stone towards a smartphone,” I was told.\n\nIts clamshell design will be familiar to many people of a certain age (I\ninclude myself) but what distinguishes it from previous generations of Doro\nfeature phones is that it comes with 4G connectivity and social media app\navailability – though unconfirmed, these are likely to include most of the big\nplayers, namely Facebook.\n\nIt feels good to hold thanks to a nicely textured backplate, which should mean\nit’s easy to hold on to, and there’s a a neat new ‘Boost’ feature that\namplifies the volume of your calls by 6-7 decibels in just two taps. Battery\nlife is being promoted as ‘all-day’ which you’d expect given the stripped back\nfunctionality.\n\n**Related:[Galaxy S9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-\ngalaxy-s9)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe Doro 7060 release date is scheduled for May 2018, with pricing set to be\nin the £80-90 region SIM-free, though it will also be available for free on\ncontracts from £10 a month from a number of major UK and Irish networks. It\ncomes packaged with a dedicated charging cradle, something the firm told me\nhelps people with dexterity issues.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThe **Doro 8035** is its smartphone brethren and will be available from March\n2018 for £120-125 outright, or free from contracts starting at around £15.\n\nIt has a more modern design and expanded feature set but, taking the mindset\nof the target market, I found it a bit slippery to grasp, in all honesty.\nStill, it wouldn’t look out of place in a pair of skinny jeans.\n\nThe coolest thing here, though, is that as well as offering Doro’s simplified\nuser interface, it’s able to boot up an enlarged (near) stock Android\nexperience complete with full Play Store access. There’s also a remote access\napplication that allows you to take control of the device and help older\nfriends and relatives get the most out of their new tech.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThese two new phones join the Doro 6520, a 3G clamshell number, to give the\ncompany a tidy selection of devices across the elderly phone spectrum.\n\nWe’ll be reviewing them in full in the near future, so stay tuned for more\nbeyond these early impressions.\n\n**What’s your favourite Doro phone?
