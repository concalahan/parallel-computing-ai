We had a couple walks. And this was\nin 2008.”\n\nApparently Jobs would say: “If we were to build a car, what would we build?\nWhat would a dashboard be? And what would this be? What would seats be? How\nwould you fuel it or power it?”\n\nWhile Jobs’ thought process wasn’t fleshed out during his lifetime, Apple\nappears to be driving the idea forward under Tim Cook.\n\nThe firm has poached several high-profile employees from Elon Musk’s Tesla, as\nwell as senior research & development figures from across the industry.  \n**  \nSee also:[4 Things Apple neglected to mention at ‘Hey Siri’\nevent](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/apple-s-iphone-6s-looks-great-\nbut-where-s-the-car-and-os-x-el-capitan)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nEarly this year, Apple executive Jeff Williams coyly called the car “the\nultimate mobile device,” but the company is yet to make any official statement\non the matter.\n\n"}
