Well,\nalmost. Ubisoft has taken the wraps off the long-awaited sequel, and we’ve\ncompiled all the information you need.**\n\nBeyond Good and Evil is about as ‘cult classic’ as gaming gets. The PS2 and\nXbox original remains a fan-favourite to this day. Beyond Good and Evil 2 was\nannounced with a brief teaser in 2008, before immediately fading into\nobscurity, joining the likes of [Half-Life\n3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/half-life-3-news-rumours-release-date-\ntrailers-gameplay-and-wishlist) and, until recently, [The Last\nGuardian,](https://www.google.co.uk/?gfe_rd=cr&ei=lMP0V62_FcSFaNLGsuAI#q=the+last+guardian+trustedreviews)\nwith no sign of a release date, gameplay or any hint of the ability to pre-\norder the game.\n\nUntil E3 2017 that was.\n\n![beyond good and\nevil](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## What is Beyond Good and Evil 2?\n\nDespite the name, Beyond Good and Evil 2 is actually a prequel to the original\nBeyond Good and Evil.\n\nWe don’t have a huge amount of detail on the actual storyline of the game, but\nthe cinematic trailer shown off at [Ubisoft’s 2017 E3 press\nconference](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ubisoft-e3-press-conference-\ntime-games-livestream) certainly whets our appetites for a bonkers romp\nthrough System 3, with a hugely diverse range of character designs,\npersonalities, buildings and vehicles.\n\n**Related:[Xbox One X](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/xbox-scorpio-\nrelease-date-specs-news-rumours-4k-vr)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n###  Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\n![beyond good and\nevil](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe world looks richly detailed, with a highly religious theme with age-old\ntemples combined with huge high-rises, and green space overseen by hulking\npolice ships. Beyond the cities, you’ll see lush countryside, huge mountains\nand you’ll even be able to fly into space without any loading screens. The\ntrailers below set up the game’s tone pretty well; a swashbuckling adventure\nwith lots of cheek and charm, set inside a large spaceship that acts as your\nhome base.\n\nOn your ship, each member of your crew has their own purpose and talents.\n\nThere’s the hint of an artefact that the player will have to find, perhaps\nsome sort of super weapon.\n\nA year later, at E3 2018, Ubisoft gave more details about the game. A new\n‘Space Monkey’ program will get fans involved with creating the game. Through\na partnership with HITRECORD, users will be able to contribute music and\nartwork to the game, which suggests that world details such as billboards on\nthe side of buildings could end up being designed in collaboration with fans.\n\nPayment for these contributions wasn’t discussed on stage, but a tweet from\nHITRECORD’s Joseph Gordon Levitt confirmed that the company pays artists for\ntheir contributions. Presumably this will be the same for Beyond Good and Evil\n2.\n\n> You are super right. Huge oversight. I think script got trimmed at last\nminute and we fucked that up. It’s hugely important to me that\n[@hitrecord](https://twitter.com/hitRECord?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) pays artists\nfairly. Since 2010 we’ve paid community almost $3 million\n<https://t.co/oauU4IUiyE>\n\n>\n\n> — Joseph Gordon-Levitt (@hitRECordJoe) [June 11,\n2018](https://twitter.com/hitRECordJoe/status/1006273000549769220?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n## Beyond Good and Evil 2 release date – When is it coming out?\n\nDespite the new trailers, we don’t have any info on release date. Considering\nthe game was first announced nine years ago, it’s anybody’s guess. But it\nlooks like Ubisoft is well and truly committed to getting this game to market,\nso we have some hope that it will arrive in the next couple of years.\n\n## Beyond Good and Evil 2 trailers\n\nWe have a full reveal trailer for Beyond Good and Evil 2, alongside a trailer\nbreakdown direct from Ubisoft. Watch them below.\n\nThe latest trailer for Beyond Good and Evil 2 provides a glimpse at how the\ntitle’s combat and spaceship mechanics are coming along:\n\nFinally, at E3 2018 we got another new trailer, as well as a trailer to\nannounce the user-generated content element of the game.\n\n## Beyond Good Evil 2 – 5 things we’d like to see\n\n**![beyond good and\nevil](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)**\n\n**Deeper story and characters**\n\nJade and her quirky range of allies from the original Beyond Good and Evil\nwere fantastic for the time, even more so when you consider how short and\ncompact the original was. We’d love for the sequel to take a deeper look at\nthe established universe, providing beloved characters with distinct\nbackstories. The addition of voice-acting and dynamic player choice would be\ngreat, showing how your actions impact the world as you progress. **  \n**\n\nIf Beyond Good and Evil 2 ends up being a prequel starring Pey’j, Jay’s\nadoptive uncle, or even her real father then it could paint a clearer picture\nof how the world we explored in the original came into being, while also\nexpanding our horizons with new planets, characters and story elements.\n\n**Ambitious open world**\n\nBeyond Good and Evil primarily took place on the planet of Hylis, rarely\nexploring the ambitious sci-fi universe that surrounded it. Granted, the\nsingle city in the first game felt sprawling and packed with activities, but\nit simply wouldn’t cut the mustard in a modern context when games such as\n[Elders Scrolls V: Skyrim](https://www.trustedreviews.com/the-elder-scrolls-v-\nskyrim-review) and [The Witcher\n3](https://www.google.co.uk/?gfe_rd=cr&ei=QBD-V8WIKefR8geXp76gCQ#q=the+witcher+3+trustedreviews)\nboast entire continents to explore.\n\nMichel Ancel has expressed interest in having multiple planets in Beyond Good\nand Evil 2, each of them being fully featured and navigable by the player.\nImagine a slew of unique locales populated by strange alien races and hostile\ncreatures, all posing their own challenges. These could also be littered with\noptional side quests and locations to discover, giving you incentive to\nabandon the beaten path.\n\n**Related:[Upcoming PS4 Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/upcoming-\nps4-games)**\n\n![beyond good and\nevil](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Improved movement and combat**\n\nYou might have heard of a little Ubisoft franchise by the name of [Assassin’s\nCreed](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/assassins-creed-origins), which\nhas some of the most intuitive movement controls in the open-world genre.\nImagine darting across the rooftops and alleys of an alien metropolis,\ntranslating the historical flair of Ezio and Altair into the realm of science\nfiction.\n\nJade’s movement felt fast, fluid and natural back in 2003, but is certainly\ndated nowadays. Giving her abilities a well-deserved overhaul would do wonders\nfor the open-world design of Beyond Good and Evil 2, giving you plenty of\ngameplay avenues when it comes to combat and exploration. **  \n**\n\nCombat in Beyond Good and Evil was pretty basic. It was restricted to just a\nsingle button, with Jade using nothing but her staff to dispatch an endless\nstream of alien nasties. The next game could improve so much in the combat\ndepartment, bringing a range of moves and abilities to our protagonist that\ntruly reflect their years of experience in the field.\n\nBeyond Good and Evil 2 could also introduce a vast number of enemy types\nacross the different planets and cities you traverse, giving us a better idea\nof the species that inhabit that weird little universe. Dispatching them in\ndifferent and constantly fluctuating ways should lend the player a slate of\nplay styles to choose from, much like Ubisoft’s other open-world games.\n\n**Related:[Best Xbox One Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-xbox-\none-games-3435271)**\n\n![beyond good and\nevil](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \n**  \nImproved character customisation**\n\nBeyond Good and Evil had its fair share of upgradeable components, letting you\npower up Jade’s health and trusty hovercraft with the right items. By today’s\nstandards, this is incredibly limited, and wouldn’t stand up to the plate in\n2016. Ubisoft has the opportunity to craft a truly unique customisation system\nwith Beyond Good and Evil 2, putting you in the shoes of a badass space\nphotojournalist.\n\nJust imagine all the things you could enhance and personalise. Jade’s camera,\nstaff and outfit are begging to be kitted out with new skills and aesthetics.\nThe possibilities are quite staggering, and that’s without having mentioned\nher hovercraft or potential spaceship. Your gear could even have different\nstat bonuses and variants, changing how you approach combat and navigate\ncertain environments.\n\n**Innovative player choice**\n\nJade could influence the world of Hylis using her Iris Network Reports in the\nfirst game, convincing the masses into siding with her and forming a\npassionate rebellion. This was an interesting mechanic, ushering in a\ngeneration of player choice that can still be felt today. Beyond Good and Evil\n2 could revitalise this in some fascinating ways, letting you choose how and\nwhy you want to influence the world around you.\n\nJade’s position as a budding photojournalist is one that allows the narrative\nto take liberties that other games would outright avoid. She could stir up a\nrevolution from nothing with just a camera and her wits, cementing her place\nin the game’s world as a genuinely monumental figure. If Beyond Good and Evil\n2 does away with Jade altogether, we’d love to see another character pick up a\nsimilar torch.\n\n_**What would you like to see in Beyond Good and Evil 2?
