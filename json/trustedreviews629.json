The firm also announced a brand-new,\n$5,000 8K monitor. We have all the details of its[CES 2017\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ces-las-vegas-2017-news-highlights-\nrumours-dates-schedule-preview \"CES 2017 news\")launches.**\n\n## Dell Canvas: A Surface Studio alternative (sort of)\n\nThe Canvas is Dell’s first entry into the world of professional work surface\ncomputing, packing in a 2,560×1,440 (QHD) display, two ‘totems’ that interact\nwith your creative applications for seamless two-handed working.\n\n_We’ve now been hands-on with the Canvas:[take a look at our first\nimpressions](https://www.trustedreviews.com/dell-canvas-review \"Dell Canvas\")_  \n  \n![Dell\nCanvas](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe Canvas will be met with comparisons to the incredible [Microsoft Surface\nStudio](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/microsoft-surface-studio-release-\ndate-price-specs-features \"Microsoft Surface Studio\") announced last year, but\nin fact this is much more a peripheral than computer. It connects to your\nhigh-end workstation over HDMI and USB and handles stylus and totem inputs.\n\nThe sorts of things you can do with it are similar to the Studio, although\nDell says that Microsoft has added extra compatibility directly into the\nWindows 10 Creators update to specifically support the Canvas.\n\nOn stage at its CES press event, Dell brought non-linear media editing firm\nAvid onto the stage to demonstrate how the Canvas would work with its Media\nComposer software package, although right now the totems aren’t supported so\nit’s hard to tell exactly how they work together.\n\n**Related:[Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 launched at\nCES](https://www.trustedreviews.com/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-review \"Dell XPS 13\n2-in-1\")**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nDell says the Canvas will also support other software packages although which\nexact programs will work remains to be seen.\n\nThe display itself can handle 100% of the ultra-tough Adobe RGB colour gamut,\na feature reserved for the most expensive monitors in the business.\n\nThere’s no price yet or UK availability info yet, but We’ll update this if we\nhear anything. In the US it’ll set you back $1,799.\n\n## Dell UP3218K: 8K insanity  \n\nDell also unveiled a quite outrageous 8K monitor that’ll set you back $5,000.\nIt has all the professional specifications you’d expect from a high-end\nmonitor, including 100% coverage of the Adobe RGB (great for photographers),\nsRGB and Rec709 and an impressive 98% DCI-P3 gamut coverage (great for video\npros).![Dell\nUP3218K](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIt’s not strictly speaking an 8K device, but manages a 7,680×4,320-pixel\nresolution for a pixel density of 280ppi. That’s the equivalent of four 4K\nscreens. On a 31.5-inch panel, that’s very impressive. Brightness is rated at\na huge 400 nits and contrast is 1,300:1.  \n**  \nVideo: We take a closer look at Dell’s 8K screen**\n\nThe only way to get smooth 60Hz 8K performance on this monitor is to hook it\nup to two DisplayPort 1.3 connectors. If you use just one, you’ll get a\njuddery 30Hz instead.\n\n**Related:[ Best monitor](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-monitors_round-\nup \"Best monitor\")** **s to buy**  \n  \nOn the back are the two DisplayPorts,and four USB 3.0 connectors. Using Xrite\nsoftware and hardware, you’ll be able to self-calibrate the monitor using\ncalibrator connected to the USB port.\n\nWe had a very close look at this screen and it really is stunning. It’s like\nthe glossiest fashion magazine you’ve ever seen but in screen form. Vibrant\ncolours, invisible pixels and incredible detail really do steal the\nshow.![Dell UP3218K\n1](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nDell says this screen will likely be used as a ‘canvas’ for creatives, with\nthe entire screen displaying images or video. You’ll have a second, smaller\nscreen, for using menus and buttons in the software you’re working with.\n\nAgain, no UK pricing yet, but we’ll update this when we get them. It’ll launch\nin the US on March 23rd.\n\n"}
