In\nextremely dim lighting conditions, when the screen brightness is too low, or\nwhen using dark wallpapers, these differences can be exaggerated.\n\n“If the colour cast affects your normal use, take your phone to an authorized\nCustomer service Center for assistance.”\n\nThe situation brings back memories of the controversy around the Google Pixel\n2 XL’s OLED screen burn-in last year.\n\n**Read more:[Huawei Mate 20 Pro vs Galaxy\nS9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/huawei-mate-20-pro-vs-galaxy-\nnote-9-3606593)**\n\nGoogle issued [a software\npatch](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/pixel-2-patch-3324610) shortly\nafter the issue was reported, and hopefully Huawei is able to provide a full\nexplanation sooner rather than later.\n\n**Are you experiencing similar issues with the Huawei Mate 20 Pro?
