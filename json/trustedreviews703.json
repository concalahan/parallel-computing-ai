Resident Evil 2 Remake was\nthe biggest reveal of the night while Death Stranding and The Last of Us 2\nreceived a pair of stunning trailers.**\n\nAlongside competitors Microsoft and Nintendo, Sony’s keynote is usually one of\nthe biggest shows in town. People will tell you that this was Sony’s chance to\ntry and ‘win’ E3 but — let’s face it — the show’s biggest winners year after\nyear are the people who get to enjoy all the games when they’re finally\nreleased.\n\n_Trusted Reviews_ has compiled everything you need to know about Sony’s E3\n2018 conference including all the latest news, announcements and what you need\nto know.\n\n## Sony Playstation E3 Press Conference Summary – All of the highlights\n\nSony’s E3 2018 press conference is over, and it was a mixed bag of stunning\ntrailers, sudden reveals, and a new format we found a little hard to swallow.\nOne of the briefing’s highlights was the announcement of [Resident Evil Remake\n2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/resident-evil-2-remake-news-rumours-\ngameplay-trailers-preorder-remaster-3261369). A re-imagining of the survival\nhorror classic has been on the cards for years now, and today is the first\ntime we’ve seen it in the flesh.\n\n[The Last of Us 2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/last-of-us-2-release-\ndate-gameplay-trailer-pre-order-news-wishlist-2944236) is coming along very\nnicely as Ellie suffers from relationship troubles and finds herself having to\nmurder countless crazy cultists on the side. Kojima Production’s [Death\nStranding](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/death-stranding-release-\ndate-2947317) FINALLY received its first gameplay trailer, and it looks\nweirdly stunning with its horrifying setting and star-studded cast. The big\nfour titles from Sony were rounded out with Sucker Punch’s [Ghost of\nTsushima](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ghost-of-tsushima-release-date-\ntrailers-story-3319443) and [Spider-\nMan](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/spiderman-ps4-2993195) from Insomniac\nGames.\n\nWhile new announcements were thin on the ground, having upcoming exclusives\nreceive an extensive helping of gameplay was great to see. That being said,\nthe lack of concrete release dates still left something to be desired. Perhaps\nthis is Sony finding its footing ahead of an inevitable new generation?\n\n## Sony PlayStation E3 2018 Conference – Watch the show for yourself\n\nThe conference might be over, but you can relive the magic in the video below.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n## Sony PlayStation E3 2018 Liveblog – As it happened\n\n**0158:** It’s begun! Sony has taken a very difference approach this year with\na smaller, more intimate conference room. As mentioned before the show, Sony\nwill be focusing on four of its upcoming exclusives with in-depth\npresentations. PlayStation CEO Shawn Layden is on stage first to kick off\nproceedings.\n\n**0204:** Gustavo Santaolalla, the composer of The Last of Us Part 2, is\ngiving us a small live performance with a banjo of all things. It’s\nsurprisingly mesmerising, and, hopefully, a small introduction before a\ndetailed look at Ellie’s next adventure.\n\n**0207:** Now it’s time for a trailer. Beginning in a ballroom scene, Ellie’s\ngirlfriend drunkenly approaches her for a dance before a camera angle\ntransitions into a completely different, far more grizzly scene. Ellie is the\nmain character this time around, filling the shoes of Joel in this twisted,\npost-apocalpytic world.\n\n**0212:** Running on similar technology to recent Uncharted titles, TLOU2\nlooks sharper and more refined. In terms of gameplay, Ellie uses a mixture of\nstealth, gunplay and utterly brutal melee combat against human enemies and the\ninfected. It’s not for the faint of heart.\n\n**0218:** The demo is over and we’re suitably blown away. Naughty Dog has done\na fantastic job with The Last of Us 2 thus far it seems. But how about a\nrelease date?\n\n**0225:** Time for a quick trailer for Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 has Sony\nshowcases four fan favourite maps receiving the remaster treatment later this\nyear. The ‘Back in Black’ map pack will be available first on PlayStation. As\na nice surprise, Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 is available in its entirety for\nPS+ subscribers right now.\n\n**0230:** Before Ghosts of Tsushima is shown off, we’re receiving a trailer\nfor Destiny 2’s Forsaken expansion. The CG trailer is wonderfully presented,\nand also features a major character event if you’re wary of spoilers. It’s\ncoming on September 4.\n\n**0232:** After another musical interlude, it’s time for a look at Sucker\nPunch’s Ghosts of Tsushima. Taking place in Japan, the open-world adventure is\nstark departure from the world of superheroes in the studio’s Infamous series.\nThe open world adventure is a sight to behold, with the large world\ntraversable by horseback. Our hero has stopped to dispatch some bandits, and\njudging by the blood, he isn’t messing about.\n\n**0239:** Much like The Last of Us 2, Tsushima boasts a mixture of combat,\nstealth and exploration. Although, it seems this also includes a healthy\namount of platform so you truly feel like a warrior capable of striking\nenemies from the shadows and on the battlefield. He can even slow down time\nwhen convenient to execute enemies, unnoticed.\n\n**0244:** A trailer for a mysterious new project has appeared! Control is the\nnew IP from Remedy Games, the creators of Max Payne and Quantum Break.\n\n**0246:** The long-awaited remake for Resident Evil 2 has been revealed, and\nit appears to use the same engine as Resident Evil 7. Whether it’s played from\na first-person perspective remains unknown, though. Iconic characters from the\noriginal will return when the game launches on January 25, 2019.\n\n**0250:** Kingdom Hearts 3 gets a new trailer revealing a world set in Pirates\nof the Caribbean. It looks gorgeous, and Kairi’s dress is positively fire\nright now.\n\n**0255:** Time for from Kojima Productions Death Stranding, and we’ve got our\nfirst ever look at proper gameplay. Set to an ominous backing track, Norman\nReedus can be seen climbing some stunning environments with some very fancy\ngadgets in tow. But what exactly do they do?\n\n**0300:** This trailer is far more coherent than past efforts, and catching a\nglimpse at gameplay for the first time is reassuring. Still no sign of a\nrelease date, but we’re definitely on board.\n\n**0304:** Nioh 2 has been confirmed! Now we’re onto a brand new trailer for\nInsomniac Games’ Spider Man , which is due for releasing this September as a\nPS4 exclusive. It plays exactly as we’ve seen in past demos albeit with\nsharper visual presentation. Iconic villains such as Rhyno and Shocker are\neven working together, likely for an evil cause. Oh snap, Scorpion is here,\ntoo! This is almost certainly the Sinister Six storyline, so Spidey has half a\ndozen baddies to deal with.\n\n**0313:** That’s it for now! Sony had an unusual show this year. Lots of\nstrong trailers, but thin of the ground in terms of reveal and the new format\nwas pretty hard to swallow at first.\n\n**Related:[Best PS4\nGames](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/ps4-games-3431751)**\n\n**What did you think of Sony’s E3 2018 conference?
