It looks stunning, so it’s must-have for any PS4 Pro owner.**[Resident Evil 7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/resident-evil-7-review):**An excellent game that really benefits from HDR, adding to the already creepyfeeling throughout the game.**[Rise of the Tomb Raider](https://www.trustedreviews.com/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-review): ** One of the best examples of PS4 Pro upgrades.

The costoutweighs the benefits. It’s worth upgrading if you’re buying a new 4K TV, butif you can’t afford both then buy the TV first. Our [best 4K TVguide](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-4k-tvs_round-up) is a good place tostart.**Seriously consider upgrading if you own already a 4K TV.** I can’t outrightrecommend you buy a PS4 Pro, but there are plenty of compelling reasons to doso. Games look great on a 4K TV on a PS4 Pro and upcoming releases like MassEffect: Andromeda and Horizon: Zero Dawn are showing great promise. Onlyreconsider if you want but don’t already own an Ultra HD Blu-ray player, or ifyou own a budget 4K TV that lacks HDR support. Head to [best Blu-rayplayers](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-blu-ray-players_round-up) for ourtop picks.**Buy a PS4 Pro if you don’t own a PS4 already.** Provided you can afford it,of course. Even if you don’t own a 4K TV, a PS4 Pro will give you faster andbetter looking games and is future proof should you upgrade your TV in future.And if you can’t afford a PS4 Pro, the existing PS4 will play all the samegames and remains a great console.
