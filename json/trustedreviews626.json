In the past, all of my cardio was outdoors and thegym was my strength training domain. But now I can tack on some of myconditioning work without the feeling that some of that effort is being‘wasted’ by not being captured.The next step I hope, is a move beyond purely cardio-based equipment. Whilewearables geared towards free weights training still have some distance to goand are admittedly a much more difficult prospect to accurately capture, Ifeel like there’s potential for GymKit to work with fixed strength trainingequipment. Imagine GymKit working with the chest press, automatically syncingthe weight racked and the reps achieved. Logging workouts would be a muchsimpler prospect. Happily, this is something that Jay Blahnik wasn’t rulingout.With Apple working with the vast majority of manufacturers, and the supposedease of retrofitting equipment, it should hopefully not be too long before yousee GymKit available in more gyms across the world. In a very Apple way, myGymKit taster session left me wondering why something like this hasn’t alreadyhappened years ago.**Have you tried Apple GymKit yet?
