And the hefty boxes and\nbottles that detergent and fabric softener are sold in aren’t much fun to drag\nhome from the shops.\n\nBefore you can start taking advantage of Dash Replenishment, you first need to\nregister the Smart IntelliDos to your Amazon account, and input your preferred\ndetergent and softener, payment method and shipping address.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nOnce that’s done, all you need to do is load up the washing machine drawer\ncompartments and choose a wash programme.\n\nThough the Smart IntelliDos will calculate and distribute precise amounts of\ndetergent and fabric softener with every load, you can either raise or lower\nthe dosage by diving into the settings.\n\nWhats’ more, if that tweak results in the IntelliDos placing an automatic re-\norder a touch too soon, you can cancel it − the machine will wait a further\nfive days before re-re-ordering.\n\n**Read more:[Best vacuum cleaner](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nvacuum-cleaner)**\n\nIt also offers extremely speedy 12-minute wash cycles for when you’re running\nlow on time, and with a feature called Auto Load Sensor, it can calculate and\nset the ideal energy and water usage, and programme duration for every load\ntoo.\n\nSharp says the Smart IntelliDos will hit the market in Q2 2019, and it will\ncost approximately €999 (~£900).\n\n**Are you tempted by home appliances with smart capabilities?
