Well fortunately, we have a\nleaked image purported to be just that, with some specs in tow.\n\nWhat may disappoint some of you though, is that it looks very much like a slim\n[Xperia Z3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/sony-xperia-z3-review) that runs an\napp mimicking the [classic Walkman\ninterface](https://www.trustedreviews.com/Sony-Walkman-A845-review). We’re not\nsurprised…\n\nPerhaps more interesting is the inclusion of hi-res audio codec support,\npaired with S-Force PRO front-firing surround speakers with Sony’s S-Master\ndigital amplifier.\n\nAlso tipped for the device is a 4-inch display with a 1440 x 720 resolution.\nThat’s well below the 5.4/5.5-inch display we’re expecting for the Xperia Z4\nproper, which makes it clear that this is a variant model.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nOn board will be a quad-core 2.3GHz Snapdragon 801 processor with 3GB of RAM,\n32GB of built-in memory, a 2000mAh battery, and an 8-megapixel snapper to\nboot.\n\n**Related:** [Sony X90C 4K TV is slimmer than the Xperia\nZ3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/sony-x90c-4k-tv-is-slimmer-than-the-\nxperia-z3)\n\nThe new device is tipped to be landing at this year’s Mobile World Congress –\nthat’s the Barcelona-based tech-fest running from March 2 to 5.\n\nThat puts it alongside the rumoured launch date for the actual Xperia Z4,\nwhich is expected to tout much higher specs, and a higher price tag too.\n\n"}
