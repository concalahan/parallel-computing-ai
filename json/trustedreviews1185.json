Unofficially,**[ **it\ndefinitely does**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/huawei-mate-20-pro-\nlite-3486661) **. Now Vodafone has brought those two states a little closer\ntogether by accidentally confirming its existence in an email to Trusted\nReviews.**\n\n“The Huawei Mate 20 lite will be available soon at Vodafone UK,” the email\nreads, revealing that it’ll be available on the network’s Red Entertainment\nplans. No exact dates or specifications were provided.\n\nGiven Huawei hasn’t confirmed the Mate 20 Lite’s existence yet, this is almost\ncertainly an email sent out in error, which will probably cause a little\ntension between the two companies. While it’s a little embarrassing though,\nthis doesn’t tell us anything we didn’t have a strong hunch about.\n\n**Related:**[ **Huawei Mate 20 Lite\nrumours**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/huawei-mate-20-pro-\nlite-3486661)\n\nPrevious leaks have highlighted the usual Huawei-built Kirin processor – in\nthis case, a Kirin 7710 –backed by 4GB RAM and 64GB internal storage. It’s\nrumoured to have a dual-camera setup on both the front (20-megapixel and\n2-megapixel) and back (24-megapixel and 2-megapixel). It’ll be a big fella,\nwith a 6.3-inch LCD display of 2340 x 1080 pixels.\n\nAnd yes, it’ll have a notch:\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n> Huawei Mate 20 Lite in black, blue, and gold.\n[pic.twitter.com/c5DVT2VVsY](https://t.co/c5DVT2VVsY)\n\n>\n\n> — Evan Blass (@evleaks) [August 14,\n2018](https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1029318723709100032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n**Related:**[ **Best Android\nsmartphones**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-android-\nphones-3438996)\n\nIt will be interesting to see how soon Huawei acknowledges the existence of\nthe Mate 20 Lite in, uh, light of this latest leak. You’d imagine it’ll be\nsoon. The fact that this email was written at all suggests an official\nannouncement was imminent anyway. And if it wasn’t before it likely will be\nnow: with the cat out of the bag, there’s really not much to lose from\nHuawei’s point of view…\n\n**Does the Huawei Mate 20 Lite look as good as the company’s recent P20\nhandsets?
