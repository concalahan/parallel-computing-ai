They were a mundane\nicon janitors propelled by a meandering narrative, too afraid to take any\nworthwhile risks. Now, with an extra year of development under its belt,\nUbisoft has crafted the finest Assassin’s Creed in a long time, and perhaps\neven the best one yet, with an extravagant rendition of Ancient Egypt\nwelcoming us with open arms.\n\n**Order Assassin’s Creed Origins\nfrom[Tesco](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7090&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-\ntescocampaign&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tesco.com%2Fdirect%2Fsearch-\nresults%2Fresults.page%3FcatId%3D4294967294%26searchquery%3Dassassins%2Bcreed%2Borigins%26SrchId%3D4294967294)**\n**|**[ **Amazon.com**](http://amzn.to/2k0nsQS)\n\nOur resident Assassin this time is Bayek, an ancient warrior pledged to\nprotect the ruler of Egypt. Bayek is my favourite lead in the series yet,\nbeating the likes of Ezio Auditore and Edward Kenway thanks to his tragic\nbackstory, which he isn’t afraid to mask with humour, and a genuine care for\nothers. His compassion is shown in how he interacts with civilians, befriends\nanimals and only ever assassinates those who deserve it. Unless I press the\nwrong button – then he’s cold-blooded killer.\n\nBayek is joined by Aya, his loving wife and a capable warrior in her own\nright. The rest of Origin’s supporting cast is equally strong, featuring the\nlikes of Julius Caesar, Cleopatra and a handful of original characters that\nsadly sit on the sidelines as the plot becomes muddled during its inconsistent\nfinal act. Ubisoft once again splices its historical world with our own,\ntransporting us into a modern setting for clumsy, hamfisted sequences that\ndon’t justify their existence.\n\nI get the impression that Ubisoft is afraid to go all-in with the sci-fi\nelements it has teased for years. Instead, it dances on the border between\nhistorical accuracy and overblown supernatural nonsense, which has me\nquestioning why the latter was ever introduced to begin with. I won’t spoil\nanything major, but watching the main characters act completely oblivious to\nwhat should be world-changing discoveries is jarring, leaving me frustrated\ninstead of enthralled by the unfolding drama.\n\n**Related:**[ **Assassin’s Creed Origins\nGuide**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/assassins-creed-origins-\nwalkthrough-3315441)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n![Assassin's Creed\nOrigins](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThis was an easy flaw to disregard for the most part, as I was so enthralled\nwith the bustling towns and sprawling deserts Origins offers. Ancient Egypt is\nthe finest setting Assassin’s Creed has ever seen, existing on a whole other\nlevel to its predecessors, both visually and mechanically. It is bursting with\nthings to do, and it’s no longer a matter of arduous busy work, such as\nmopping up seemingly endless collectibles and floating eagle feathers.\n\nThe majority of the side quests have been crafted with care, many carrying\ntheir own miniature narratives that are ideal distractions for those more\nattuned to short bursts of play. One such mission saw me befriending a down-\nand-out gladiator. His dominating stature soon melted away to reveal a soft-\ncentred man with a heart of gold. It’s a shame that some of these tender\nmoments are ruined by cutscenes where characters simply stare dead-eyed at one\nanother, exchanging dialogue with no emotion at all.\n\nThe lavishly produced story sequences are the polar opposite and look\nphenomenal, making the aforementioned missteps difficult to ignore, especially\nwhen they occur so often. Origins maintains the iconic mixture of stealth,\nassassination and parkour platforming for which the series is renowned, but\nupdates it in a way that’s fresh and exciting.\n\n**Related:[Assassin’s Creed Origins Curse of the Pharaohs DLC hands-\non](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/assassins-creed-origins-curse-of-\nthe-pharaohs)**\n\n![Assassin's Creed\nOrigins](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCombat has a welcome new feel, now more reminiscent of Dark Souls or the\nArkham series than anything Assassin’s Creed has seen before. Attacks are\nperformed with RB/R1, while Bayek can break an enemy’s guard with a quick tap\nof RT/R2. Pressing the two together unleashes a special attack that changes\ndepending on your loadout, but always with a satisfying and flashy finisher.\n\nYou can lay into guards with an endless flurry of slashes or bide your time,\nwaiting for a perfect parry to wipe them out in a single strike. Origins\nallows combat to be approached in a multitude of different ways, with each\nweapon feeling different to use. The mace swings with real sense of weight,\nwhile dual-wielding swords saw me darting around my foes like a maniacal\ndoctor wielding a scalpel. Battles are a core part of Origins, so the variety\non offer is impressive.\n\nWhile you can’t avoid fights altogether, the option to progress through\nOrigins with stealth as your predominant weapon is perfectly viable. Sneaking\nmechanics haven’t undergone the same overhaul as combat, but it still feels\ngreat to conquer an outpost as nothing but a lingering shadow. Bayek’s arsenal\nis incredibly malleable, with sleep darts and predatory bows proving the ideal\ntools for conquering many a Roman Citadel. However, the enemy AI will\noccasionally have a brain-fart and forget you exist, or sprint off a cliff\ninstead of ringing the alarm.\n\n**Related:**[ **Super Mario\nOdyssey**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/mario-odyssey)\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nUbisoft has taken a few obvious pointers from its open-world siblings, with\nOrigins awash with ideas clearly inspired by [The Witcher\n3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt),\n[Destiny](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/destiny-2) and [Far\nCry](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/far-cry-5-release-date-news-gameplay-\ntrailer-preorder-wishlist-rumours-2951187). This sadly robs Bayek’s adventure\nof any real sense of originality but does result in a 30+ hour journey that is\na joy to play.\n\nSome quests will now have you investigating the environment, searching for\nclues that lead to the next objective. Bayek’s inner monologue is competently\nexecuted enough that I always felt invested, eager to get to the bottom of\neach new mystery. Side quests tend to rely on this formulaic approach a little\ntoo often though, so it becomes a case of searching for objects before your\ninevitable assassination target is revealed.\n\nOrigin’s inventory system also takes liberal inspiration from other titles. In\na nutshell, it’s Destiny. Weapons, armour and tools are organised in terms of\nrarity, and old equipment can be either dismantled or sold for crafting\nmaterials. Once again, it’s not an original system, but one that serves the\nAssassin’s formula in a brilliant fashion. It’s a far cry from the jumbled\nmess of menus found in Unity and Syndicate.\n\nSpeaking of Far Cry, the open world is dotted with outposts of varying sizes,\nbegging to be taken over. I found each a delightful playground for\nslaughterous experimentation. By pressing ‘up’ on the d-pad you can summon\nSenu, your pet eagle, to scout for soldiers, alarms and potential loot hidden\nwithin enemy camps. This soon becomes second nature, and I found myself using\nhim whenever approaching a new location. It’s smooth, intuitive, and so much\nfun to go in prepared.\n\n**Related:**[ **Best Xbox One\nGames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-xbox-one-games)\n\n![Assassin's Creed\nOrigins](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAncient Egypt is a stunning playground – so vast that by the narrative’s\nconclusion, entire regions of the map remained untouched. Scaling towering\npyramids and venturing into dark, claustrophobic tombs were definite\nhighlights, presenting an overwhelming sense of scale that was almost vertigo-\ninducing. These are all synchronisation points too. You’ll gain access to new\nicons across the map before diving into a precarious hay-bale below.\n\nHaving played on a development kit of Microsoft’s [Xbox One\nX](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/xbox-one-x-preorder-specs-price-\nrelease-date-2993238), I was blown away by the graphical fidelity of\nAssassin’s Creed Origins. It’s gorgeous, showcasing immense draw distances,\nwater effects and character models that really come to life on more powerful\nhardware. In terms of performance, I only found a significant drop in frame\nrate when cramped in a tight room, filled with enemies and chaotic fire\neffects. It was rock solid, and surprisingly lacking in bugs for such a large\nworld. We’ve yet to see how it holds out on other platforms, but I hope it’s\njust as consistent.\n\nMounts can be purchased in the form of camels and horses, but they are\nrelatively interchangeable. Dropping 5,000 drachma on a legendary ride is\npointless when you find them scattered across the plains of Ancient Egypt\nregardless. Origins would have benefitted from a greater level of\ncustomisation overall, with many of aesthetic options beyond its extensive\nskill tree feeling limited.\n\n**Related:[Wolfenstein 2: New\nColossus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/wolfenstein-2-the-new-colossus-\npreview-release-date-preview-gameplay-trailers-2951732)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nYou can purchase additional weapon and costume packs with Helix Credits, a\ncurrency that can be gained by spending real-world money. I was unable to see\nhow this played out, but Origins seems generous enough with loot that I never\nsaw myself tempted by extra goodies.\n\n## Verdict\n\nAssassin’s Creed Origins is the revitalisation I was desperately hoping for.\nMy cautious optimism has been rewarded by an excellent open-world adventure\nthat could lead to an exciting future for Ubisoft’s blockbuster franchise.\n\nWhile it lifts its finer ideas from other open-world titles, it executes them\nwell enough to form a whole that entertained me for hours and hours. It’s a\nshame the narrative eventually jumps the shark, or this could have been\nsomething truly special.\n\n**Order Assassin’s Creed Origins\nfrom[Tesco](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7090&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-\ntescocampaign&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tesco.com%2Fdirect%2Fsearch-\nresults%2Fresults.page%3FcatId%3D4294967294%26searchquery%3Dassassins%2Bcreed%2Borigins%26SrchId%3D4294967294)**\n**|**[ **Amazon.com**](http://amzn.to/2k0nsQS)\n\nNow, when is Ubisoft going to take us to feudal Japan?\n\n## Score\n\n  \n\n"}
