Of course, you are reliant instead on a decent mobile signal\nand data connection, but even in the deepest parts of rural Britain there’s at\nleast some basic coverage.\n\nThe simplified interface Android Auto and CarPlay provide on top on an\ninfotainment system allows for simple navigation of the app, with the goal of\npreventing a driver from being distracted from having their eyes off the road\nfor too long.\n\nThe iPlayer Radio app itself is fairly well featured, with four sections to\nhelp motorists quickly select stations, access podcasts and shows that have\nbeen downloaded onto their mobile, select shows to listen to at a later date,\nand a shortcut to stations that the user has subscribed to.\n\n**Related:[How to install Kodi on a Fire\nStick](https://www.trustedreviews.com/how-tos/install-kodi-fire-tv-stick)**\n\n**Do you own a car that’s compatible with Android Auto or CarPlay?
