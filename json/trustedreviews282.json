It’s like a tiny Mac Pro, but far better for gaming.\n\nInside that tiny metal chassis you get the latest in CPU and graphics tech,\nwith quad-core Intel Core i5 and i7 CPUs along with either [Nvidia’s GeForce\nGTX 1050 Ti](https://www.trustedreviews.com/nvidia-geforce-gtx-1050-ti-review\n\"GTX 1050 Ti review\") (in the “UHD” model) or [GTX\n1060](https://www.trustedreviews.com/nvidia-geforce-gtx-1060-review \"GTX 1060\nreview\") (in the “VR” model). The VR name indicates this PC is indeed ready\nfor virtual reality headsets.\n\n![Gigabyte Brix\ngaming](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \n**  \nRelated:[Best desktop PCs](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-desktop-\npc_round-up \"Best desktop PC\")**  \n  \nThey’re small, but they don’t lack connectivity. There’s a pair of USB 3.1\nType-C ports, three USB 3.0 connectors, three mini DisplayPorts and a full-\nsize HDMI 2.0 port as well. There’s dual-band Wi-Fi antennas as well as\ngigabit Ethernet from Intel, and you can choose between SATA storage of high-\nspeed M.2 drives. The two SO-DIMM memory slots support up to 2133MHz DDR4\nmemory for speedy, compact performance.\n\n![Gigabyte Brix\ngaming](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nYou won’t be able to replace the processor or graphics chip (it uses an MXM\nconnector instead of the standard PCIe), but if you get your tools out you’ll\nprobably be able to replace most of the other components with a bit of effort.\n\nWe don’t have pricing on these new compact PCs, but expect them to appear on\nstore shelves later this year.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n**Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.**\n\n"}
