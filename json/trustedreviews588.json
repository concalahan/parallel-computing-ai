The design also gets a boost,\nthanks to a glass back, much larger display and thinner bezels than before.\n\nAs expected, Moto has dropped in the Snapdragon 636 processor and offers 4GB\nof RAM with up to 64GB of storage. You’ll also get a 3000mAh battery (down\nfrom the [Z2 Play](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/moto-z2-play)‘s\n3510mAh cell) and USB-C fast charging for your reasonable expenditure.\nUnfortunately, that Gorilla Glass 3 covered back doesn’t open the door to\nwireless charging, which means it’s just for aesthetics and smudge collection.\n\n**Related:[Best smartphone](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nsmartphone-3431175)**\n\nThere’s a 6.01-inch Super AMOLED display with a 1080p resolution and an 18:9\naspect ratio. The display size is up considerably from last year’s 5.5-inch\nmodel, without the need to add a notch. The fingerprint sensor is moved to the\nside because the phone’s chin is smaller and Moto Mods rule out a presence on\nthe back. It’s a tight squeeze on a phone that’s only 6.75mm thick, but we’ll\nreserve judgement until testing.\n\n![Moto Z3\nPlay](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nNow, about those cameras. The dual camera on the rear offers a 12-megapixel\nsensor with an aperture of f/1.7, while the 5-megapixel companion offers\ndepth-sensing capabilities. The selfie camera promises 8-megapixel portrait\nmode shots with an f.2.0 lens. The company is also offering Face Unlock tech.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThe phone, which runs on Android 8.1 Oreo, is compatible with all Moto Mods\nadd-ons to date.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAvailability has only been announced in Brazil and the United States thus far.\nIn the US, you’ll get the phone unlocked for $499 (about £370) along with a\nbattery Mod. The company promises 40 hours of battery life when the phone and\nmod are paired. However, it may have managed that simply by keeping last\nyear’s battery size.\n\nAvailability in other territories will be announced in the weeks to come. Last\nyear the Z2 Play rocked up in the UK for £380, so let’s hope Moto keeps the\npricing reasonable this time around.\n\n**Does the Moto Z3 Play sound like it could challenge the OnePlus 6 in the\nsub-£500 category?
