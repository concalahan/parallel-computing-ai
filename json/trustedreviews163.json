Samsung has provided a feature whereby you canuse the camera to scan an item, then search online for the best priceavailable. We’re yet to test this out, but it sounds like a genuinelyinnovative addition, even if it is just another excuse to spend money.**Using Bixby with voice**Samsung says Bixby won’t get confused if you don’t say the exact phraserequired to activate a particular action. The assistant is said to be smartenough to understand incomplete information, and will apparently start a taskeven if it didn’t understand the whole of the command – carrying out the partsit did understand and waiting for you to fill in the gaps later with morecommands.Sammy also promises “new voice interfaces” to make the whole thing asintuitive as possible, so it shouldn’t take long to get used to Bixby’sfeatures.**Bixby in the future**Samsung says Bixby is just the first part of its plan for AI on smartphones.In the future, the company will be adding more Bixby-enabled apps, beforereleasing a tool (in SDK) which third-party developers will be able to use tomake their applications and services Bixby-enabled.And it won’t just be smartphones that benefit from the evolution of Bixby.Samsung has plans to add its new assistant to all its appliances, allowing youto “control your air conditioner or TV through Bixby”. It says it will do thisby using Cloud technology, so that as long as a device has an internetconnection and” simple circuitry to receive voice inputs”, it will be able toconnect with Bixby. It’s all designed to bring the assistant to every aspectof your life, which is precisely what Amazon is trying to do with its Alexaassistant and Echo device, and what numerous others, such as Google and Appleare working towardsUnfortunately, Samsung’s being a tad cagey on when certain Bixby features willbe available in specific regions. The latest information we have is that Bixbywill be available on all Samsung S8 smartphones at launch, but its Voicefunction will only be available in Korean and US English from May. Morelanguages will be supported over time, according to the company. Whether UKusers will be able to take advantage of all Bixby’s features from May, byusing the US English version, remains unclear at this point, but we shouldhear more in the near future.**Related:[Amazon Echo vs Dot vsTap](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/amazon-echo-vs-amazon-dot-vs-amazon-tap-difference)****Excited to try out Bixby?
