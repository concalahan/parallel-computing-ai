Now a fresh snippet regarding the phone’s\nspecs is causing a little concern among Android fans.\n\nAn allegedly leaked slide from a Korean company has been uncovered by Italian\nwebsite [Androidworld.it](http://www.androidworld.it/2015/09/09/lg-\nnexus-5-2015-slide-333939/) (via [SlashGear](http://www.slashgear.com/lg-\nnexus-5-2015-now-leaked-in-black-but-with-only-2gb-ram-09403935/)), and it\nappears to confirm the new Nexus 5’s specs – but with one fairly big\nalteration.\n\nMost notable among these specs is the idea that the new phone will have only\n2GB of RAM. That’s the exact same amount of memory as the old [Nexus\n5](https://www.trustedreviews.com/google-nexus-5-review), which launched in\n2013.\n\nMost modern flagship smartphones now come with 3GB of RAM, with some even\nstarting to stretch to 4GB. Does this mean that the new Nexus 5 will be a mid-\nranger?\n\nIt’s quite possible that this slide is based off old data, or that it’s simply\nmistaken in its 2GB prediction.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n**SEE ALSO:[Best Android Smartphones\n2015](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-android-phones-1_round-up)**\n\nOther than this questionable assertion, the leaked slide appears to back what\nwe’ve heard previously about the new Nexus 5. Apparently, it will have a 5.2in\nFull HD display, a Snapdragon 808 CPU, and a choice of either 32GB or 64GB of\ninternal storage.\n\nGoogle is also expected to be launching a 5.7in high-end phablet follow-up to\nthe Nexus 6 over the coming weeks. Unlike the new Nexus 5, it will be made by\nChinese manufacturer Huawei.  \n **  \nCheck out our smartphone group test video below:**\n\n"}
