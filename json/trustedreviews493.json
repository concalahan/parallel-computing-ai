They’ve been functional rather\nthan fashionable; durable rather than delicate. The Google Pixel 3 is the\nfirst entry that _feels_ like a match for the [iPhone\nXS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xs) and [Samsung Galaxy\nS9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9).\n\nFrom a distance, and especially in pictures, the Pixel 3 looks just like the\n[Pixel 2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-2). Pick it up,\nhold it and then you’ll notice the difference.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![iPad Pro 2018](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: MySmartPrice / @OnLeaks \n\n### New iPad Pro 2018 leak shows Apple is almost certainly dropping the Home\nbutton\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ipad-pro-2018-release-date-specs-\nprice-3482812 \"New iPad Pro 2018 leak shows Apple is almost certainly dropping\nthe Home button\")\n\n  * [ ![Pete Lau on stage at the OnePlus 6T launch](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### The OnePlus 6T ditched the headphone jack, CEO Pete Lau tells us why\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ceo-pete-lau-oneplus-6t-headphone-jack-\nwireless-charging-3612475 \"The OnePlus 6T ditched the headphone jack, CEO Pete\nLau tells us why\")\n\n  *   * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### iOS 12.1 Features: Group FaceTime, Dual SIM, new emoji arriving Tuesday\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ios-12-1-features-3612493 \"iOS 12.1\nFeatures: Group FaceTime, Dual SIM, new emoji arriving Tuesday\")\n\n  * \n\n**Related:[Best Android phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nandroid-phones-3438996)**\n\n![google pixel 3\nback](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe back is now smooth, constructed completely out of glass and almost soft to\nthe touch. It has the finish of a heavily polished pebble and slips\ncomfortably into your palm. Instead of just putting glass on the back and\nstopping there, Google has split the look of the glass: the top portion is\nshiny, with the lower area matte.\n\nI love the matte finish here – it’s most noticeable on the white and pink\nversions – as it reduces smudges and adds some of the grip often lost when\nglass is switched to metal. This is still a slippery phone though, especially\nif you’re coming from a Pixel or Pixel 2, and being glass means it is less\nresistant to drops. I’ve seen some other Pixel 3 users report issues with the\nrear scratching, something I have yet to see. However the soft back does\n_feel_ like it would scratch easily and I will keep an eye on this over the\nnext few weeks.\n\nSwitching to glass also allows Google to introduce wireless Qi charging and it\nhelps retain the IP68 water-resistance rating.\n\nA USB-C port is the only connection here – there’s no 3.5mm headphone jack –\nand that’s flanked by a SIM card tray. Along the right hand side there’s a\nclicky volume rocker and power button that, on my white version, has a\ncontrasting mint colour. I love this hit of vibrancy even though I would\nprefer it was orange like the Pixel 2 XL.\n\n**Related:[Best wireless charger](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nwireless-charger-3505891)**\n\n![google pixel 3\nside](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nHaving all the buttons on one side isn’t for me and I much prefer having the\nlock switch on its own. This is how it’s done on the iPhone XS and it means\nyou don’t accidentally alter the volume when you want to turn the phone on.\nIt’s a minor quibble, but one that has frequently frustrated me during my time\nwith the Pixel 3.\n\nFlip the phone over and you’ll notice the biggest difference between this and\nthe Google Pixel 3 XL – the screen. Aside from being smaller (this has a\n5.5-inch display, as opposed to a 6.3-inch one), the Pixel 3 doesn’t have the\ndeep notch cutting into the display. Instead, it’s an 18:9 panel with a\nthinner border running around it than the Pixel 2. This makes it feel a lot\nmore modern and so much better looking.\n\nThis isn’t a completely edge-to-edge display though, as two front-facing\nspeakers sit above and below the display. You’ve also got dual selfie cameras\ntoo.\n\n![google pixel\n3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nA 5.5-inch screen might sound intimidating if you’re used to the older Pixels\n(both had 5-inch screens) or an iPhone (typically with a 4.7-inch screen) but\nthanks to the slimmer bezel the Pixel 3 is just about the same size overall as\nthose two phones. It’s comfortable to use in one hand and small enough to slip\ninto the pocket of tight jeans or a handbag. I’d say it’s the perfect size for\na phone.\n\n## **Google Pixel 3 – Screen**\n\nAt 5.5 inches, the screen on the Pixel 3 is the biggest of the non-XL Pixel\nphones. It’s also the best.\n\nColours are punchy and bright, with none of those murky whites that ruined the\ndisplay on the Pixel 2 XL. Blacks are deep and inky too, thanks to the\ndecision to stick with an OLED panel rather than an LCD one. OLED screen\nallows for pixels to be individually lit, meaning they can be turned off\ncompletely to display perfect blacks. It also means you won’t drain too much\nbattery by using the always-on display.\n\nResolution of the panel is FHD+ (2160 x 1080), which might cause some concern\nfor those wondering why it’s not been beefed up to Quad-HD+ (2960 x 1440) like\nthe Samsung Galaxy S9 and [LG\nG7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/lg-g7). Honestly, at this size I\nstruggle to decipher any difference between the two resolutions unless I get\nunnaturally close and really look for individual pixels. This is a perfectly\ncrisp, detailed panel and one that wouldn’t be much better with a higher\nresolution.\n\n**Related:[Best smartphones 2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nsmartphone-3431175)**\n\n![google pixel 3\ndisplay](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nGoogle has also added [HDR](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/hdr-tv-\nhigh-dynamic-television-explained-2927035) support here, with compatible\nvideos on YouTube looking truly stunning. Apparently these phones will support\nHDR Netflix streams too, but this wasn’t available at the time of review.\nActually, Netflix won’t even play in HD on either of my Pixel 3 review\ndevices, so that’s slightly odd. I assume an update will rectify this.\n\nViewing angles are excellent and there’s enough oomph in brightness to see the\nscreen outside. To my eye it’s not the brightest display around though, and\nyou’ll probably find yourself manually altering the brightness levels a lot\nmore than, say, with an iPhone.\n\nGoogle is going for an accurate representation of colours of the screen of the\nPixel 3 and there’s noticeably less saturation in reds and green than you’ll\nfind in a Samsung phone. You can tweak the screen setting slightly with\nBoosted, Natural and Adaptive options available. Adaptive is the default and I\nhaven’t felt the need to change it.\n\n## **Google Pixel 3 – Performance**\n\nA very obvious theme ran throughout Google’s unveiling of the Pixel 3: specs\nwere barely mentioned. Its thinking is that the software optimisation and how\nthings work are far more important than flashy numbers and huge amounts of\nRAM.\n\nIf you are interested in the internals though, here’s a quick rundown:\n[Snapdragon 845](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-flip-\nphone-3603862), 4GB RAM and 64GB of non-expandable storage with a 128GB model\navailable for £100 extra. It’s the standard spec-sheet for a 2018 flagship\nphone.\n\n4GB does seem _slightly_ meagre when there are more and more phones with 6 or\n8GB, and the Snapdragon 845 is likely to be replaced in the coming months by a\nrumoured Snapdragon 855 with 5G support. Yet, having used the Pixel 3 for an\nextended period, I am not worrying about performance.\n\n![google pixel\n3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nThis thing is fast, churning through everything I can throw at it without\nlagging or feeling bogged down. Games play smoothly and open as fast as any\nother Snapdragon 845 phone. It is, however, slower than the iPhone XS when\nopening the same game or app – but then comparing iPhones and Android phones\nis virtually impossible as there are so many different factors.\n\n_See the below charts for performance in synthetic benchmark tests._\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nBenchmark results in Geekbench 4\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nScores from Antutu 7\n\nThe real test for the Pixel 3 will come 12-18 months down the line. That’s\nwhen the amount of RAM _could_ become an issue. We’ll just have to wait and\nsee.\n\nAudio quality from the stereo front-facing speakers is truly excellent. As the\nsound is aimed towards you, it’s not blocked by hands when you’re watching a\nvideo and Google Assistant queries can easily be heard across a room. There’s\nno headphone jack here, but Google does include both a 3.5mm headphone jack\nadaptor and a pair of perfectly fine USB-C earbuds in the box.\n\nThese earbuds look a lot like the Pixel Buds from last year and they boast\nsome of the same translation functions too. There’s Bluetooth 5 support too,\nif you’re more a fan of wireless headphones.\n\nA feature often forgotten about on Android phones is haptics: that vibration\nbuzz you get when a message or call comes through. The vibration on the Pixel\n2 was very weak and the one used here is a big improvement. Google seems to\nknow this and as a result you’ll get a lot more small haptic responses\nthroughout the OS. There’s one when you pull down the notification panel and\nanother when you flick through apps.\n\nWith lots of other phones switching to the face unlock systems, it seems a bit\nodd Google is holding steadfast with fingerprint authentication. The rear\nsensor is ridiculously fast and I would take this any day over an in-display\noption that doesn’t work to unlock apps, but some form of face unlock would\nhave been nice.\n\n## **Google Pixel 3 – Software**\n\nThe Google Pixel 3 runs Android 9 Pie with the Pixel launcher on top, and it’s\nthe best software experience on any Android phone. It’s certainly missing some\nfeatures; a deep and customisable battery-saving mode being the most obvious\nto me, but the general experience is fantastic.\n\nThe UI is clean and simple; fast to navigate and never overbearing. There’s\nthe essential Google apps pre-installed and absolutely nothing else. As a user\nof Google services, the way everything works and syncs together is nothing\nshort of fantastic.\n\n[Google Photos](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-photos-\nbackup-3499307) remains the single best way to back up and store snaps, with\nthe Pixel 3 offering unlimited full-resolution uploads to the cloud.\n\n![google pixel 3\nphotos](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nWe’ve already got an in-depth look at Android 9 Pie so I won’t go too much\ninto the specifics here, but here are a couple of the standout features…\n\n**Related:[Android 9 Pie\nfeatures](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/android-pie)**\n\nThe big Pie addition is Digital Wellbeing. This lets you not only monitor your\nphone usage – including seeing how many times you unlock the phone a day and\nhow many notifications you get – but helps you curb it by blocking out certain\napps during selected periods and halting notifications when you’re sleeping.\n\nDigital Wellbeing remains in beta and a full release should come later in the\nyear. It’s quite basic, but visually it’s easy to quickly glance at your\nusage, and being able to limit, say, my Instagram time to an hour a day is\nmuch needed.\n\n![google pixel 3 digital\nwellbeing](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nPie also tweaks notifications, grouping more important ones together and\nmaking them more visible, plus it ditches the traditional soft-keys for\ngesture-based navigation.\n\nPixel 3-specific features are kept to a minimum, and the majority of them are\nnot yet available or restricted to the US. There’s a call-screening feature,\nfor example, coming to certain areas of the States later in 2018, which will\nuse Google’s Duplex AI to actually answer spam calls for you. I’ll be sure to\ntry this out when it comes to the UK.\n\n[ Next  \nCamera ](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-3-camera)\n\n"}
