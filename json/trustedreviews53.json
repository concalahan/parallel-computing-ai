Asus says that all of the displays\nfeature 178 degree viewing angles and cover 72% of the NTSC colour gamut,\nwhich is roughly equivalent to 100% of the sRGB gamut. We’ll know for sure\nonce we’ve got them in for testing.\n\nAll of these displays feature Asus’s ‘NanoEdge’ technology, which is\nessentially a fancy way of saying that they’ve got very slim bezels; each new\nZenBook boasts a 95% screen-to-body ratio. You’ll also have the option of\ntaking a ZenBook with an anti-glare display, which knocks about 100g off of\nthe weight, not that this would matter much, as these are all pretty\nlightweight laptops.\n\nAsus’s new ErgoLift hinges have the advantage of lifting the laptop’s lower\nhalf off of the desk surface, which is intended to make for a nicer typing\nexperience, as the keys are angled towards you, and allowing for better\ncooling and audio performance.\n\nThe ZenBook 15 is similar to the 13.3-inch and 14-inch variants in a lot of\nrespects too. The main difference is that you’ll have the option of going for\na Full HD or 4K display. The battery is also significantly bigger, but if you\ngo for the 4K option, we expect that you won’t get as much mileage as you\nwould with the Full HD option. Large, detailed screens require a lot more\njuice, after all.\n\n**Related:[Asus ZenBook 15](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/asus-\nzenbook-15-2018)**\n\n## ZenBook 13, 14, and 15 – Specifications\n\n| **ZenBook 13** | **ZenBook 14** | **ZenBook 15**  \n---|---|---|---  \nDisplay | 13.3-inch FHD | 14-inch FHD | 15.6-inch FHD, 15.6-inch 4K (3820 x\n2160)  \nCPU | Core i7-8565U, Core i5-8265U | Core i7-8565U, Core i5-8265U | Core\ni7-8565U, Core i5-8265U  \nGraphics | Nvidia GeForce MX150 with 2GB GDDR5 VRAM,\n\nIntegrated Intel UHD Graphics 620\n\n| Nvidia GeForce MX150 with 2GB GDDR5 VRAM,\n\nIntegrated Intel UHD Graphics 620\n\n| Nvidia GTX 1050 Max-Q, 2GB/4GB GDDR5 VRAM, Integrated Intel UHD Graphics 620  \nMemory | 8GB / 16GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 | 8GB / 16GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 | 8GB / 16GB\n2133MHz LPDDR3  \nStorage | 1TB PCIe 3.0 x4 SSD / 512GB/256GB PCIe 3.0 x2 SSD | 1TB PCIe 3.0 x4\nSSD / 512GB/256GB PCIe 3.0 x2 SSD | 1TB PCIe 3.0 x4 SSD / 512GB/256GB PCIe 3.0\nx2 SSD  \nWireless Connectivity | Dual-band 802.11ac gigabit-class Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.0\n| Dual-band 802.11ac gigabit-class Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.0 | Dual-band 802.11ac\ngigabit-class Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.0  \nPorts | USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-C, USB Type-A (up to 10Gbps),\n\nUSB 2.0, HDMI, microSD, 3.5mm headphone jack\n\n| USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-C, USB Type-A (up to 10Gbps),\n\nUSB 2.0, HDMI, microSD, 3.5mm headphone jack\n\n| USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-C (display support), USB Type-A (up to 10Gbps), USB\nType-A (up to 5Gbps)\n\nHDMI, SD card reader, 3.5mm headphone jack  \n  \nBattery | 50Wh 3-cell lithium-polymer,\n\nUp to 14 hours battery life\n\n| 50Wh 3-cell lithium-polymer,\n\nUp to 14 hours battery life\n\n| 73Wh 4-cell lithium-polymer,\n\nUp to 116 hours battery life  \n  \nDimensions | 302 x 189 x 16.9 mm | 319 x 199 x 15.9mm | 35.4cm x 220 x 17.9mm  \nWeight | 1.19kg | 1.19kg | 1.69kg  \n  \n## Asus ZenBook 13, 14, and 15 – Prices\n\nPrice details for the various 2018 Asus ZenBook iterations have not yet been\nreleased.\n\n## Asus ZenBook 13, 14, and 15 – Release date\n\nAsus has not yet mentioned when the new 2018 ZenBook laptops will be going on\nsale.\n\n![The Asus ZenBook Flip 15 \\(UX562\\) in 'display'\nmode.](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Asus ZenBook Flip 13 (UX362) and Flip 15 (UX562)\n\nBoth of these new 2-in-1s will feature the latest 8th gen Whiskey Lake CPUs\nfrom Intel, the ErgoLift hinge for greater comfort, cooling and audio, and a\n‘world-facing’ camera which will let you enjoy mixed/augmented reality\napplications.\n\nThe camera is an optional extra for the ZenBook Flip 13, whereas it’s included\nwith the ZenBook 15 as standard. Some versions of the 13.3-inch ZenBook will\nalso come with Asus’s screenpad, a touchpad with additional context-dependent\ncontrols, while none of the 15.6-inch versions will feature this.\n\nJudging by the specs, the Flip 15 is the one that’ll be better suited to\ncreatives. You get two screen options – 4K and Full HD – both of which promise\nexcellent colour reproduction, but the 4K one is PANTONE validated. Both\noptions come with a discrete GPU (an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Max-Q) with 2GB\nof GDDR5 VRAM.\n\nFinally, there will be a dual-storage version of the ZenBook Flip 15, where\nyou’re promised the best of both worlds, fast SSD speeds and high HDD\ncapacity.\n\nBoth of the 2018 ZenBook Flip 13 and Flip 15 feature NanoEdge near bezel-less\ndisplays and are roughly 10 per cent smaller than their predecessors.\n\n![The Asus ZenBook Flip 13 \\(UX362\\) in standard laptop\nmode.](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Asus ZenBook Flip 13 and Flip 15 – Specifications\n\n| **ZenBook Flip 13** | **ZenBook Flip 15**  \n---|---|---  \nDisplay | 13.3-inch FHD (backlit LED) | 15.6-inch LED-backlit 4K UHD\n(3840×2160) touchscreen, Delta-E ≦2 /\n\n15.6-inch LED-backlit FHD (1920×1080) touchscreen, Delta-E ≦3\n\nPANTONE Validated  \n  \nCPU | Core i7-8565U, Core i5-8265U | Core i7-8565U, Core i5-8265U  \nGraphics | Integrated Intel UHD Graphics 620 | Nvidia GTX 1050 Max-Q, 2GB\nGDDR5 VRAM  \nMemory | 8GB / 16GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 | 16GB 2400MHz DDR4  \nStorage | 256GB, 512GB PCIe SSD / 256GB, 512GB SATA3 SSD | 512GB PCIe SSD /\n\n256GB, 512GB SATA3 SSD and\n\n2TB SATA HDD 5400RPM  \n  \nWireless Connectivity | Dual-band 802.11ac gigabit-class Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.0\n| Dual-band 802.11ac gigabit-class Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.0  \nPorts | (With world-facing camera) 2 x Type-C, USB 3.1 Gen 1, 3.5mm headphone\njack / (Without world-facing camera) 2 x USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type-C, USB 2.0 Type-A,\nHDMI, 3.5mm headphone jack | USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type-C (data transfer only), USB\n3.1 Gen 1 Type-A, USB 2.0, Standard HDMI, SD card reader, 3.5mm headphone jack  \nBattery | 50Wh 3-cell lithium-polymer (battery life not yet specified) | 57Wh\n4-cell lithium-polymer / 86Wh 6-cell lithium-polymer battery (SSD version\nonly)  \nDimensions | 305 x 169 x 16.9 mm | 357 x 226 x 20.9mm  \nWeight | 1.3kg | 1.9kg  \n  \n## Asus ZenBook Flip 13 and Flip 15 – Prices\n\nAsus has yet to talk about prices for the new ZenBook Flips.\n\n## Asus ZenBook Flip 13 and Flip 15 – Release date\n\nEqually, we don’t know when the Asus ZenBook Flip 13 and Flip 15 will be\nhitting shelves.\n\n**Related:[Best laptop](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nlaptops-3431966)**\n\n## ZenBook Pro 14 (UX480)\n\nAs the name implies, this laptop is aimed at professionals, photographers and\ndesigners in particular.\n\nThe 14-inch Full HD display apparently covers the entire eRGB gamut and it’s\nalso PANTONE verified, which gives you some indication of its colour accuracy.\nWithout a colorimeter to hand we’ve not yet been able to verify these claims,\nbut that’s something we wouldn’t normally do until we got hold of a review\nsample anyway. The 16:9 aspect ratio suggests that it’ll be well suited to\nvideo playback and streaming.\n\nRounding out its pro credentials is an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Max-Q dGPU –\nthe same one you get with the new ZenBook Flips – but this time you have the\noption of taking 2GB or 4GB of GDDR5 VRAM, depending on your working needs.\n\nThe display and the GPU combined with the promised boost to rendering times\nthat you should get with a Whiskey Lake CPU means that powering through video\nedits on Premiere Pro ought to be a breeze.\n\nWe saw a ZenBook Pro 14 (UX480) earlier in the year at Computex, alongside a\nlarger [ZenBook Pro 15](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/zenbook-pro)\n(UX580) sibling. But this was before Intel had revealed its new 8th gen laptop\nprocessors.\n\nAsus has confirmed that the 2018 ZenBook Pro 14 will come with Whiskey Lake\nCPUs, but the jury’s currently out whether the Pro 15 will get the same\ntreatment. We’d assume so, but we’ll wait until we have confirmation.\n\n## Asus ZenBook Pro 14 – Specifications\n\n| **ZenBook Pro 14**  \n---|---  \nDisplay | 14-inch FHD, 16:9 aspect ratio  \nCPU | Core i7-8565U, Core i5-8265U  \nGraphics | Nvidia GTX 1050 Max-Q, 2GB / 4GB GDDR5 VRAM  \nMemory | 8GB/16GB 2400MHz DDR4  \nStorage | 128GB / 256GB SATA 3 SSD\n\n256GB / 512GB PCIe® x2 SSD\n\n1TB PCIe x4 SSD  \n  \nWireless Connectivity | Dual-band 802.11ac gigabit-class Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.0  \nPorts | USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-C, USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-A, USB 2.0, Standard HDMI,\n3.5mm headphone jack  \nBattery | 70Wh 4-cell lithium-polymer (battery life not yet specified)  \nDimensions | 225 x 323 x 17.9mm  \nWeight | 1.6kg  \n  \n**Related:**[ **Best Intel processor: Core i3, i5, i7 and i9\nexplained**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-intel-processor-3517396)\n\n## Asus ZenBook Pro 14 – Prices\n\nNo mention of price for the ZenBook Pro 14, but _Trusted Reviews_ understands\nthat its 15-inch equivalent was expected to be priced £1900 and £2200 for\nmodels with 8th gen Core i7 and Core i9 CPUs. This may be an indicator of what\nyou can expect to pay for the ZenBook Pro 14.\n\n## Asus ZenBook Pro 14 – Release date\n\nWe don’t have so much as hint of a rumour of a whisper about the ZenBook Pro\n14’s release date just yet.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## ZenBook S (UX391FA)\n\nWe saw a [ZenBook S](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/zenbook-s) at\nComputex, but the one Asus had on show at IFA is a revamped Whiskey Lake-\nequipped version.\n\nA key benefit of ditching the i5-8250U and i7-8550U for newer models is\napparently better battery life.\n\nA battery drain test saw a ZenBook S with Whiskey Lake Core i5-8265U and the\nscreen dipped to 150 nits last 20 hours when playing video via the Windows\nMovie & TV app. That’s a great figure, so let’s hope that this bears up in our\ntesting and the i7 version is similarly impressive.\n\nAside from a decent battery, what do you get with the ZenBook S? The choice of\nFHD and 4K screens, all of which promise 100% sRGB colour gamut coverage, a\nvery light 1kg body, and the same ErgoLift hinge which should at once make\ntyping easier and stop the ZenBook S’s base from getting too hot.\n\nAs the ZenBook S represents a stripped back, entry-level equivalent to the\nmain ZenBooks and the more powerful ZenBook Pro, something’s got to give and\nthat something is ports. There’s no HDMI ports or microSD or SD card readers,\njust three USB ports, all of which support display as well as power and data\ntransfer.\n\nWe’re hoping that the price is going to be nicer to reflect the smaller size\nand fewer connectivity options. In the meantime, while we’re waiting on price\ninfo and release dates, here are the specs:\n\n**ZenBook S – Specifications**\n\n| **ZenBook S**  \n---|---  \nDisplay | 13.3-inch LED-backlit 4K UHD (3840 x 2160) 16:9 standard touchscreen\n/\n\n13.3-inch LED-backlit Full HD (1920 x 1080) 16:9 standard touchscreen /\n\n13.3-inch LED-backlit Full HD (1920 x 1080) 16:9 anti-glare display  \n  \nCPU | Core i7-8565U, Core i5-8265U  \nGraphics | Integrated Intel UHD Graphics 620  \nMemory | 8GB / 16GB 2133MHz LPDDR3  \nStorage | 1TB / 512GB PCIe 3.0 x4 SSD /\n\n256GB PCIe x2 SSD  \n  \nWireless Connectivity | Dual-band 802.11ac gigabit-class Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.0  \nPorts | 2 x USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-C (Thunderbolt 3), USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type-C, 3.5mm\nheadphone jack  \nBattery | 50Wh 3-cell lithium-polymer (up to 20 hours video playback on Core\ni5 version)  \nDimensions | 305 x 169 x 16.9 mm  \nWeight | 1.3kg  \n  \n_Note: We weren’t able to spot any models on Asus’s IFA stand, so for now\nwe’re mainly going from the spec sheet and our notes from back in June._\n\n**Excited about the new Asus’s new Whiskey Lake-powered ZenBook laptops?\nMeditate with us Twitter @TrustedReviews**\n\n"}
