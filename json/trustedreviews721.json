Take this with a pinch of salt, but it\nseems like a plausible launch window to us.\n\n## The Last of Us Part 2 Story – What’s it about?\n\nNaughty Dog has revealed that The Last of Us Part 2 takes place five years\nafter the original left off, with a 19-year-old Ellie acting as the game’s\nmain character. Joel also makes a return, watching over Ellie as a slowly\naging old man. The main drive of the narrative is unclear, but we know Ellie\nis very, very angry about something. **  \n**\n\nIn the reveal trailer, she is seen playing guitar, slathered in blood amongst\na pile of corpses. After finishing her song she says to Joel: “I’m going to\nkill every last one of them.” We’ve no idea who Ellie is so pissed at, but\nit’s clear anger will act as a core theme in The Last of Us Part 2. Neil\nDruckmann has confirmed that [Westworld’s Shannon\nWoodward](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/the-last-of-us-part-2-recruits-\nwestworld-actress) will play a role in the sequel, although we currently know\nnothing about her character.\n\n## The Last of Us Part 2 developer – Who will do it?\n\nIt will be developed by Naughty Dog, the creators of Uncharted, Crash\nBandicoot and Jak and Daxter.\n\n## The Last of Us Part 2 Trailers\n\nOn stage at its press conference at E3 2018, Sony gave us another look at the\nmuch-anticipated The Last of Us Part 2.\n\nThis all new trailer lead from a lengthy cinematic into a stealth gameplay\nsegment. From the looks of things, TLoU2 will be every bit as harrowing as its\nprevious trailers have suggested.\n\nMoving into combat, Ellie’s bow and arrow quickly made an appearance before\nshe was forced into a particularly brutal piece of melee combat. It looks like\nthe game will transition pretty regularly between action and stealth, as you\ndesperately try and even the odds against your more well-equipped enemies.\n\nWe’ve embedded the trailer below so you can watch it for yourself.\n\nPreviously, our latest trailer was from Paris Games Week 2017. Be warned, it’s\nincredibly graphic and not for the faint-hearted.\n\n**Pre-order The Last of Us Part 2 from**[ **Amazon**](http://amzn.to/2nXudlk)\n\n## The Last of Us Part 2 – What we’d like to see\n\n**More terrifying enemies**\n\nThe denizens of infected we faced in The Last of Us were unsettling to say the\nleast, but never truly terrified us. Unless we happened to be playing on\nGrounded with no way to defend ourselves. By adopting a new setting, Naughty\nDog should also introduce a host daunting new enemies. The infected should be\nbigger and more challenging. Sometimes, the best tactic might be to avoid them\naltogether.\n\nNow I’m not about to google cordyceps since I’ll likely bump into countless\nimages of disgusting things, but it’d be cool to see The Last of Us 2\nintroduce some animals affected by the fungus as new enemy types.\n\n**Dialogue choices**\n\nUncharted 4 saw the introduction of brief yet intriguing dialogue choices for\nus to make, providing a small sense of variety to an otherwise linear\nnarrative. It gave Nathan Drake’s charming, one-liner personality an\nadditional layer of substance, albeit a very superficial one.\n\nHaving the ability to respond to various dialogue choices as you explore The\nLast of Us 2 would be fantastic, far more so when we consider the mature\nthemes this franchise has been willing to tackle. There could be moments of\ncomedic brilliance and sudden heartbreak, emphasized by our personal\ninvolvement in each decision. It’d also be nice to have these impact the plot\nin some way, either through brief mentions or major narrative crescendos.\n\nWe’ve seen what narrative choice in post-apocalyptic worlds can do in the\nlikes of Telltale’s The Walking Dead. Being forced to choose who we save in\nThe Last of Us Part 2 could be equally heart-wrenching.  \n**  \nRelated:[Spider-Man PS4 latest\nnews](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/spider-man-ps4-release-date-trailer-\ngameplay-pre-order)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \n**  \nA real human threat**\n\nIf you’ve ever seen The Walking Dead, you’ll know the real enemy isn’t the\nundead, but those still amongst the living. The corruption people face in the\nclutches of a broken world is horrifying, making far worse monsters than the\nvirus we all contend with. We saw a small glimpse of this in the first game\nwith random thugs, cannibals, and the fireflies, all of which posed a veil of\nmoral ambiguity that kept us guessing with each passing minute.\n\nThe Last of Us 2 should go all in on this, painting an antagonist worthy of\nloathing in a world already filled with disgusting examples of humanity. Joel\nwas capable of some horrendous acts in the closing moments of his journey,\ndoing what he believed was right in a world simply not worth saving.\n\n  \n**  \nGreater focus on the multiplayer  \n**\n\nTo the surprise of many, The Last of Us’ multiplayer was excellent. It\ntranslated the crafting and survival mechanics of its single-player into the\nrealm of online skirmishes almost perfectly. You could collect ingredients and\ncraft tools mid-match, getting the drop on your enemy through a range of\nbrutal methods. The repertoire of tools was backed up by a weighty selection\nof matchmaking options, too.\n\n**Related:[Days Gone](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/days-gone-release-\ndate-gameplay-trailer-pre-order-ps4-pro)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nOne of my favourite aspects of the multiplayer was its implementation of\nsocial networks into online progression. A victory would net you supplies for\nyour faction, the members of which are named after a myriad of Facebook\nfriends. Of course, they weren’t really stuck in an infested hellhole, but the\nmere inclusion of their presence gave your actions a faint yet powerful\ncontext. The Last of Us 2 should double down on this idea, making each battle\na personal endeavor driving not only a level but a will to survive.\n\n**Pre-order The Last of Us Part 2 from**[ **Amazon**](http://amzn.to/2nXudlk)  \n**  \nWhat would you like to see from The Last of Us Part 2?
