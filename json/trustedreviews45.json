The\n[Acer Swift 7 (2018)](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/acers-new-\nswift-7-ultrabook-thinnest-ever-brings-4g-lte-3367465) is now your new\n‘world’s thinnest laptop’, and packs built-in 4G LTE connectivity to boot.\nPricing will comfortably clear the £1,000 mark when it becomes available later\nin the year, making it an immediate rival to the equally new [2018 Dell XPS\n13](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/new-dell-xps-13-2018-release-date-\nprice-specs-rose-gold-3365441).\n\n### Asus at CES 2018: News and highlights\n\n![Chromebox\n3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nNot wanting to be left behind, **Asus** had a significant announcement of its\nown, unveiling a new small-form-factor PC, the Mac mini-like [Chromebox\n3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/asus-chromebox-3-looks-like-mac-mini-\nupgrade-apple-refuses-make-3368075). As the name suggests, it will run Chrome\nOS, while support for both dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Gigabit LAN mean that\n4K video streaming should be a breeze.\n\n### Byton at CES 2018: News and highlights\n\nCES always produces at least one sleeper hit, and this year Chinese startup\n**Byton** is in pole position to take home the honours. Following a handful of\nteaser images released prior to the show, the new [Byton electric\ncar](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/byton-electric-car-suv-revealed-\nprice-specs-tech-3367806) has now been officially unveiled.\n\nAnd it’s a feast for the eyes, whether you’re an electric car enthusiast or\njust a plain ol’ petrolhead. It hits the crucial 0-60 mark in roughly five\nseconds, which isn’t quite a track-worthy spec, but is impressive nonetheless.\nThe company is striving to improve its self-driving capabilities, too, ahead\nof an expected consumer launch in 2019.\n\n### Dell at CES 2018: News and highlights\n\nWe already knew what to expect from **Dell** , even before its CES press\nconference.\n\nAhead of this year’s show, the company revealed a new XPS 13 laptop, with the\nkey talking point being that the refreshed model packs Intel 8th-gen Core i\nseries chips, as well as the option of a 4K screen – just like big sibling the\n[XPS 15](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/dell-xps-15). We got a a\nchance to go [hands-on with the new Dell XPS 13\n(2018)](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/dell-xps-13), while the XPS 15\nalso got a new look, transforming into a 2-in-1 device at this year’s show.\nRead our [Dell XPS 15 (2-in-1) hands-on\nreview](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/dell-xps-15-2-1) to learn more.\n\nThe new XPS 13 enjoys a number of external tweaks, coming thinner and lighter\nthan ever before in a snazzy new Rose Gold finish. It was one of the most\nhighly anticipated laptops of CES 2018, so watch our first look video (above)\nto see it in all its glory.\n\n**Related:[Dell XPS 13 (2018) vs XPS 15\n(2-in-1)](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/dell-xps-13-vs-15-3368804)**\n\n### Google at CES 2018: News and highlights\n\n**Google** has been surprisingly busy at CES 2018, using the show to launch a\n[massive Google Assistant\noffensive](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-assistant-smart-display-\nheadphones-android-auto-3368127) for the year ahead.\n\nIts ‘Hey Google’ event in Vegas featured more products than you could shake a\ncroupier rake at, with the internet giant showcasing a bevy of new third-party\nwares that will feature its AI helper.\n\nSmart speakers, intelligent touchscreen devices, and headphones were\nparticularly well represented, with the likes of Bang & Olufsen, Jaybird, JBL,\nLenovo, LG, Klipsch, Panasonic, RIVA Audio and Sony all revealed to be\ndeveloping new Assistant-ready kit.\n\nHowever, it’s probably Assistant’s Android Auto integration that has us most\nexcited, with Big G announcing a new Actions feature for Android Auto (see\nvideo above) that will allow you to access directions, reminders, music and\nmore through voice commands on compatible cars.\n\nKia will be one of the first auto makers to join the party, with Assistant set\nto play a central role in a number of its top 2018 models, including the K900,\nOptima, and Soul EV.\n\nThink Google Assistant is happy playing second-fiddle to Amazon’s Alexa?\nJudging by CES, it’s time to think again.\n\nElsewhere, Google-owned smart thermostat **Nest** has combined forces with\niconic lock maker Yale to create the [Nest x Yale\nLock](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/nest-x-yale-lock-smart-home-\nlock-3368707), a new smart lock that promises more intelligent home security\nand is another one of this year’s CES sleeper hits.\n\n### HTC at CES 2018: News and highlights\n\nRumours of a [Vive](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/htc-vive) follow-up\nlaunching at CES sounded almost too good to be true, but that’s exactly what\nTaiwanese outfit **HTC** treated us to this year.\n\nThe new [HTC Vive Pro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/htc-vive-pro-specs-\nfeatures-price-release-date-3368038) looks set to usurp its predecessor as the\nworld’s most premium VR headset, boasting an improved display resolution and\npixel density. It doesn’t quite offer the 4K experience many of us were hoping\nfor, but its 2880 x 1600 dual OLED display still represents a 78% improvement\non the original Vive – and its jumps 74% to 615ppi to boot.\n\nA redesigned head strap should make it easier to mount and unmount the Vive\nPro, but probably the best bit is that HTC has confirmed it will be offering\nan official Vive Wireless Adapter from summer. We’ve often said that cutting\nthe cord is essential to VR hitting the big time, so this is very exciting\nnews idneed.\n\nPricing and exact release dates for HTC’s new kit are still to be confirmed,\nbut judging by the price of the original Vive, the Pro won’t come cheap.\n\n### Intel at CES 2018: News and highlights\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nMuch to the delight of PC gamers, **Intel** finally lifted the lid on its\nfirst batch of CPUs to feature AMD Vega graphics at CES 2018. The new chips\nare designed to bring improved gaming to a number of this year’s ultraportable\nlaptops, with [Intel’s AMD Vega\nchips](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/intel-lifts-lid-amd-vega-powered-\nchips-promises-smooth-gaming-ultra-thin-laptops-3366729) set to be available\nin Core i5 and Core i7 variants.\n\nOne of the first machines to break cover? The updated [HP Spectre x360\n(2018)](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/new-hp-spectre-x360-15-2018-specs-\nprice-release-date-3367792), which was also unveiled at the show and is\npictured above.\n\nAn important aside was that Intel also pledged to patch all Meltdown and\nSpectre affected chips by the end of the month, which is good news for – well,\npretty much everyone who owns a computer of any ilk!\n\n### Lenovo at CES 2018: News and highlights\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nChinese tech giant **Lenovo** might have been one of the last big names to\nhold a CES press conference, but it still had plenty to share with us, not\nleast its eagerly anticipated standalone [Daydream\nVR](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/daydream-vr-3148686) headset. Dubbed\nthe Lenovo Mirage Solo, it offers a tether-free, phone-free VR experience –\nthe first product of its kind on Google’s Daydream platform. Set to retail for\n“under $400” (read: $399.99), it’s pricier than Google’s [Daydream\nView](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-daydream-view) headset,\nbut will work out cheaper when you account for the cost of a Daydream-ready\nphone.\n\nLenovo also had a bevy of new laptops, tablets and monitors to show. For\nstarters, its ThinkPad range has been updated with 2018 models of the ThinkPad\nCarbon, Yoga, and Tablet. The trio have a few particularly interesting new\nfeatures, including support the Dolby Vision HDR standard, Intel 8th Gen\nchips, and (tablet notwithstanding) built-in Amazon Alexa. These machines are\njoined by a refreshed ThinkVision X1 4K monitor – and that’s not all.\n\nThere’s also the all-new Lenovo Miix 630, which is one of the first laptops to\nbe powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 chipset. This Windows-running device\nwas teased in late 2017 when we attended the Qualcomm Summit, and we finally\ngot a chance to try one out at CES – read our full [Lenovo Miix 630 hands-on\nreview](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/lenovo-miix-630) to find out\nmore.\n\nOf its other major announcements, the Lenovo Smart Display (pictured above)\ngarnered the most attention. It’s basically an [Amazon Echo\nShow](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/amazon-echo-show), but swapping\nAlexa for Google Assistant as its AI helper of choice. Our man on the ground,\nMaxwell Parker, reckoned its biggest selling point is its design, declaring it\nto be a more stylish alternative to the Echo Show in his [Lenovo Smart Display\nhands-on review](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/lenovo-smart-display-\ngoogle-assistant). It’s set to be released in the US in summer 2018 and is\nexpected to come to the UK thereafter.\n\n### LG at CES 2018: News and highlights\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nPrior to CES, **LG** was one of a number of firms to make big pre-show\nannouncements, revealing that it would be showcasing a ‘rollable’ 65-inch 4K\nOLED at this year’s show, whetting the appetite of TV enthusiasts everywhere.\n\nTrue to its word, that’s exactly what happened, with a prototype of this\nincredible concept shown off on stage at LG’s presser – as were all of [LG’s\n2018 OLED TVs](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-2018-oled-tv-range-\nspecs-price-release-date-3367924).\n\nAlongside these high-end sets, there was also some spotlight time for the\ncompany’s new ThinQ sub-brand, which will see the South Korean outfit baking\nAI technology into everything from TVs and speakers to fridges, air\nconditioners, and even robots – though that particular demo didn’t quite go\naccording to plan.\n\nIts Google Assistant-equipped [LG ThinQ WK9 smart\ndisplay](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lgs-google-assistant-smart-\ndisplay-beaten-ugly-stick-3369702) failed to impress US reporter Chris Smith,\nhowever, who said it had been “beaten with the ugly stick,” though we’ll have\nto review it in full before declaring his vanity right or wrong.\n\n### Nvidia at CES 2018: News and highlights\n\nCausing a stir early on at this year’s CES was **Nvidia,** which announced\nthat it will start producing mammoth 65-inch Big Format Gaming Displays, or\nBFGDs for short. These will feature a 4K resolution and HDR support, as well\nas G-Sync compatibility. Manufacturing partners announced at the show include\nHP, Acer and Asus. There’s no word on pricing or availability yet, but we’re\nhoping to learn more in the near future.\n\nRead our complete [guide to Nvidia\nBFGDs](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/nvidia-4k-hdr-big-format-gaming-\ndisplays-3367451) to learn more.\n\n### Panasonic at CES 2018: News and highlights\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nPanasonic FZ950\n\nOne of the first big names out of the gate at this year’s CES was\n**Panasonic.** It unveiled its highly anticipated follow-up to last year’s\nexcellent [Panasonic EZ1000](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/panasonic-\nez1002) OLED TVs. Our Home Technology Editor, Ced Yuen, reckons the Japanese\nfirm’s new [FZ950 and FZ800](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/panasonic-\nfz950-fz800-4k-oled-tvs-closest-thing-hollywood-home-3367156) sets are the\n“closest thing to Hollywood in your home.”\n\nSound exciting? We thought so, too, but if that’s not your cup of tea, the\nfirm also outed a handful of new 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray players – and a Google\nAssistant smart speaker for good measure.\n\n### Qualcomm at CES 2018: News and highlights\n\n![Qualcomm\nCES](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nChip maker **Qualcomm** used its CES soap box to reveal more about its car\nambitions, announcing that the automotive version of its well-known Snapdragon\nplatform – unsurprisingly known as the Snapdragon Automotive Platform – will\nfeature in the 2018 Honda Accord and future Jaguar Land Rover vehicles. Among\nother things, Qualcomm will be helping to power in-car info and entertainment,\nas well as 4G and Wi-Fi connectivity.\n\nHere’s the [full story.](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/qualcomm-packing-\nsnapdragon-tech-honda-jaguar-land-rover-vehicles-3367900)\n\n### Samsung at CES 2018: News and highlights\n\nUnsurprisingly, **Samsung’s** CES manifesto centred on its TV plans for 2018 –\nbut that doesn’t mean it was all plain sailing, far from it.\n\nInstead, Sammy outlined the bold strategy it believes will help it conquer\nOLED with its own TV technologies this year. It consists of three parts:\nsignificant upgrades to its existing\n[QLED](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/what-is-qled-the-future-of-tv-\ntech-explained-2945941) range in the short term; the introduction of 8K Micro\nFull Array TVs later in the year; and, finally, its first Micro LED offering\nin late-2018 or early 2019.\n\nRead our full guide to [Samsung’s QLED vs OLED battle\nplan](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-2018-qled-vs-oled-micro-\nfull-array-micro-led-3367473) to learn more.\n\nAway from TVs, the company firm revealed an intriguing new notebook that\nseemingly combines the best of a light laptop with one of the [Galaxy Note\n8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-8)‘s most useful\nfeatures – the S Pen stylus – and outed an upgraded [Samsung Family Hub smart\nfridge (2018)](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-family-hub-smart-\nfridge-2018-revealed-bixby-smart-things-3368629) that now comes complete with\nBixby, SmartThings integration, and AKG speakers.\n\nSmartphones weren’t forgotten, either, with Samsung outing a new mid-range\nphone, the Galaxy A8. Sammy’s ‘A’ series phones sit just below their flagship\n‘S’ devices, bringing some of those devices’ fancier features to a more\naffordable price point. Read our [Samsung Galaxy A8 (2018) hands-on\nreview](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-a8) for more or\nwatch the video above.\n\nThere was no [Galaxy S9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-\ngalaxy-s9-release-date-specs-features-price-uk-3266552) reveal, however,\nalthough speculation has it that the oft-rumoured foldable [Galaxy\nX](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-x-foldable-phone-\nrelease-date-news-specs-price-2951423) smartphone might have gotten a [secret\nreveal](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-x-foldable-phone-\nrumoured-december-launch-3368717) behind closed doors at CES. What we do now\nknow for sure, though, is that the S9 will [launch at Mobile World Congress in\nFebruary](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s9-launch-\nconfirmed-february-mobile-world-congress-3369390), as Samsung mobile boss DJ\nKoh spilled the beans out in Vegas.\n\nIt has been a busy few days for the South Korean chaebol, that’s for sure!\n\n**Related:[Samsung Notebook 9 Pen hands-on\nreview](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-notebook-9-pen)**\n\n### Sony at CES 2018: News and highlights\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nJapanese electronics giant **Sony** has been plenty busy at CES, too.\n\nOn the mobile front, Sony launched its first [new Xperia phones of\n2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/new-sony-xperia-phones-2018-3367784)\nin the form of the [Xperia L2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sony-\nxperia-l2), [Xperia XA2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sony-xperia-\nxa2) and Xperia XA2 Ultra. The mid-range trio sees the Japanese tech giant\nfinally unlock its fingerprint scanning tech for the US market, as well as\nboosting the processor to a Snapdragon 630 and upping the camera spec. The\n6-inch XA2 Ultra is arguably the most interesting, as – while pricing hasn’t\nbeen confirmed – it’s likely to be one of the more affordable options if you\nwant a really, really big Android phone, given where the company’s XA range\nsits in Sony’s overall mobile portfolio.\n\n**Related:[Sony Xperia XA2 Ultra hands-on\nreview](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sony-xa2-ultra)**\n\nIn addition, the firm has revealed an update to last year’s excellent A1 OLED\n– the [Sony AF8 OLED](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/sony-a1-oled-just-\ngot-updated-introducing-sony-af8-oled-3368110).\n\n## CES 2018 Highlights: The best of the rest\n\nThat’s most of the major manufacturers accounted for, but there have been a\nnumber of other noteworthy announcements worth knowing about.\n\nOn the mobile front, **Alcatel** unveiled a trio of new Android smartphones,\nheadlined by the surprisingly interesting sounding Alcatel 5. Why’s it worth\nmentioning? Well, Alcatel’s phones rarely come with top shelf prices, but the\n5 looks set to get an 18:9 display, which typically only features on flagship\nsmartphones. We suspect said display will have a Full HD+ resolution, and the\ncompany also talked up a “large battery” for the device – something in the\nregion of a 3000mAh cell sounds about right to our eye. Read our [full\nreport](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alcatel-2018-series-android-\nphones-3368861) to learn more.\n\nLuxury Danish brand **Bang & Olufsen** made an appearance at this year’s CES,\nalbeit under the guise of its B&O Play lifestyle brand. There were a [pair of\nnew headphones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/bo-play-\nheadphones-h9i-h8i-3368885) on offer, with new flagship over-ears the Beoplay\nH9i joined by “revitalised classic” cans, the Beoplay H8i. As you’d expect,\nboth are sleek and stylish as well as boasting solid audio credentials at a\nrelatively affordable (for B&O) price point.\n\n![Beoplay\nH8i](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nTCL had a relatively busy CES, most notably talking up its role as saviour of\nthe **BlackBerry** phone brand. We learned that the [BlackBerry\nMotion](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/blackberry-motion) will finally\nbe coming to the US, but more intriguingly, that company has plans to launch\n[new BlackBerry phones in 2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/new-\nblackberry-phones-2018-keyone-2-keytwo-3368773). There’s also going to be a\nnew flavour of the [BlackBerry\nKEYone](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/blackberry-keyone), the Bronze\nEdition, that will feature dual-SIM support – perfect for those who like to\nkeep work and play separate (or are having an affair). Elsewhere, TCL unveiled\nthe [Roku Smart Soundbar](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/tcl-roku-smart-\nsoundbar-revealed-3369497), and there’s no prizes for guessing what that’s all\nabout.\n\nOn the smartwatch front, **Casio** had an expected trick up its sleeve in the\nform of the solar-charging [Casio G-Shock Rangeman GPR\nB-1000](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/casios-solar-assisted-rangeman-\nwatch-legit-lifesaver-3368891). This GPS watch is also the first in the\nG-Shock range to support wireless charging, and boasts an overall (claimed)\nbattery life of over 30 hours on a full charge. The solar charging\ncapabilities don’t sound super practical for day-to-day use – you’ll need a\nfour hour sun boost to get one hour’s worth of juice – but it could come in\nhandy for more adventurous types.\n\nIf you were expecting a flashy new drone from **DJI** , you’ll be leaving\nVegas disappointed this year, but the company did out an updated version of\nits excellent Osmo Mobile smartphone gimbal – the [Osmo Mobile\n2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/dji-osmo-mobile-2). There’s plenty\nto like here, as not only is the Osmo Mobile 2 lighter than its predecessor,\nit’s also cheaper, so it should appeal to casual as well as more serious\nvideographers.\n\n![DJI Osmo Mobile\n2](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nCar manufacturer **Ford** made a small but important\n[announcement](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/waze-maps-comes-\nto-2018-ford-cars-3370329) with new partner Waze. The two revealed that 2018\nFords will benefit from direct Waze integration via Ford’s built-in Sync 3\ninfotainment system, so you’ll be able to take advantage of Waze’s\ncrowdsourced maps and navigation without the need for Android Auto or Apple\nCarPlay support.\n\nWhilst not a blockbuster reveal, **Garmin** updated its solid Forerunner 645\nrunning watch, announcing the Garmin Forerunner 645 Music. As the name\nsuggests, this iterative refresh is all about improving the device’s musical\ncapabilities, ushering in on-board storage for your tunes and support for\nBluetooth headphones. Check out our [Garmin Forerunner 645 Music hands-on\nreview](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/garmin-forerunner-645-music) to\nlearn more.\n\nIt was a fairly quiet outing for Chinese tech giant **Huawei** , with the\nfirm’s only real noteworthy announcement being that the excellent [Huawei Mate\n10 Pro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/huawei-mate-10-pro) – its\nlatest flagship – has finally been [cleared to land in the\nUS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/huawei-mate-10-pro-us-launch-\nmicrosoft-carrier-3368099).\n\nDigital assistants are all the rage at this year’s CES, and one of the most\npromising products we’ve seen comes from **Jabra** in the form of the [Jabra\nElite 65t,](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/jabra-elite-65t) which are\ntrue wireless earbuds that support a full suite of AI helpers in Amazon Alexa,\nGoogle Assistant, and Siri. We’ve been impressed by the quality of Jabra’s\nmicrophones in the past, so we have high hopes for these fitness-friendly\nearbuds.\n\n![Jabra Elite\n65t](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nOne of the more interesting CES 2018 announcements came from **Kodak.** The\nlegacy photography brand pulled a bit of a shocker, launching a new blockchain\nplatform for photographers, KodakOne, alongside its own cryptocurrency,\nKodakCoin. While surprising to say the least, our staff writer Josh Levenson\nreckons it’s actually “relatively practical.” Read his [full\nreport](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/kodak-coin-cryptocurrency-launch-\nkodakone-blockchain-share-price-3369465) to find out why it might not be quite\nas much of a shameless PR stunt as it sounds.\n\nIconic German auto firm **Mercedes-Benz** didn’t have any new wheels to show\noff (CES isn’t the show for that), but its new native [MBUX infotainment\nsystem](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/mercedes-benz-mbux-infotainment-\nsystem-might-blow-carplay-away-3368945) could blow Apple CarPlay and Android\nAuto away. Always-on voice controls will let drivers control maps, music,\ntemperature and even seat position, with the new tech set to debut with the\nnext A-Class series in February.\n\nThose looking to improve the quality of their sleep could do worse than check\nout **Nokia’s** new [Nokia Sleep\nsensor](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/nokia-says-can-get-12-minutes-\nextra-sleep-night-3368026), which is a discreet Wi-Fi connected sensor you\nplace under your mattress that feeds back a range of sleep cycle data,\nincluding how much time you spend in light, deep and REM stages of shut-eye.\nNokia (or rather, Nokia Health – formerly Withings) says better sleep\nrecognition can help you get up to 12 more minutes of slumber a night. To this\nend, the Nokia Sleep syncs with the Nokia Health Mate app for easy visibility\nand is compatible with other Nokia Health products like the excellent [Nokia\nBody](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nokia-body) smart scales, as well\nas supporting IFTTT recipes. Read our Health and Fitness Editor Richard\nEaston’s guide to the [best sleep tech of\nCES](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ces-best-sleep-tech-3369534) for\nmore.\n\n![Nokia\nSleep](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSuperhero fans will want to take of **One61 Studio’s** new [Batman-themed\nsmartwatch](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/someone-went-made-batman-\nsmartwatch-fight-crime-steps-3369740). Its feature set is extremely basic as\nit doesn’t run a full-fledged OS, but that’s OK. Because Batman.\n\n4K projectors are nothing new, but 4K projectors with built-in voice\nassistants? That’s a very 2018 development – and exactly what **Optoma** had\nup its sleeve at CES this year. The new [Optoma\nUHD51A](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/optoma-uhd51a-4k-projector-with-\nalexa-3368838) might have slightly utilitarian naming, but it’s the first\nprojector of its kind to feature Amazon Alexa voice controls. Set to go on\nsale in select regions at the end of March, expect UK pricing to comfortably\nclear the £1000 mark when its come to pricing.\n\nAudio specialist **Polk** announced what might just be the best sounding\nproduct at CES to launch with Alexa integration, the new [Polk Command\nBar](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/polk-command-bar-may-best-sounding-\nalexa-device-yet-3368950). It features the usual array of Alexa functionality,\nincluding the ability to voice control your music streaming, smart home\ndevices, and other AV kit, as well as some very decent specs: there’s\nBluetooth and Wi-Fi, of course, plus two 1.25 x 3.25-inch full-range drivers,\ntwo 1-inch tweeters and a wireless 6.5-inch subwoofer. Best of all, it’ll\nlaunch at the more affordable end of the soundbar spectrum, with initial\npricing set for $299 when it hits shelves in April.\n\nIf you haven’t yet heard of UAV specialist **PowerVision** , it’s a company\nwell worth keeping an eye on if the [PowerVision\nPowerEgg](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/powervision-poweregg-drone-\nlooks-like-alien-ship-arrival-3369793) drone on display at CES is anything to\ngo by. It’s quite unlike any drone we’ve seen before. When closed, it\nresembles one of the spooky egg-shaped vessels that feature in Denis\nVilleneuve’s film _Arrival_ , but then – seemingly out of nowhere – it expands\nand grows propeller arms, four legs, and the ability to fly and shoot video in\n4K. A classic CES ‘WTF?!’ moment if ever there was one.\n\nYou might associate gaming company **Razer** more with laptops and\nperipherals, but at CES it was all about showing off the prowess of its new\n[Razer Phone](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/razer-phone). First up\nwas the [news](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/razer-phone-netflix-hdr-\ndolby-3368871) that it’ll be the first handset to offer Netflix with both HDR\nand Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 support, which should make it the best phone to\ncatch-up on your favourite shows while on-the-go. More intriguingly still is\n[Razer Project Linda](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/razer-project-linda-\nnews-price-release-date-android-laptop-dock-3368958), the firm’s prototype for\na future laptop that will be powered completely by the Razer Phone. This is a\nconcept that many have failed at, but judging by what we saw on the ground,\nRazer has the best chance yet at cracking the elusive ‘lapdock’.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThere were robots aplenty at this year’s CES, but for the average punter, the\nmost interesting reveal arguably came from **Segway**. It unveiled a consumer\nversion of the [Segway Loomo](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/segways-\nloomo-robot-part-hoverboard-part-friendly-robot-companion-3368019), which is\npart hoverboard, part mechanical companion – and all gnarly. As is often the\ncase at CES, there’s no news of price or a release date just yet, but it could\nbe one of 2018’s most talked about gadgets, should it see light of day in the\nnot-too-distant future.\n\nKeep reading for key details such as the CES 2018 dates.\n\n## CES 2018 Dates: When did CES 2018 start and end this January?\n\nThe dates of CES 2018 were January 9-12, with media-only events scheduled for\nJanuary 7 and January 8. If you had a pass, you were free to roam the Las\nVegas Convention Center and check out all the latest and greatest gizmos – the\nbest of which we’ve outlined above – for yourself.\n\nAs we just hinted at, though, CES is a trade show, meaning you’re meant to\nhave an industry affiliation to be able to attend. If you’re thinking about\ngoing next year, these passes aren’t quite as difficult to get hold of as they\nsound, though, as a standard attendee pass costs at least $300 – for that\nmoney, we reckon the event organisers will probably overlook any ‘creative\nliberties’ you might take in the credentials section of your registration.\n\nTo recap: CES kicked off in Las Vegas, Nevada on January 9 and ended on\nJanuary 12. Media briefings and press conferences took place on January 7 and\nJanuary 8, the details of which you can find in our complete CES 2018 news and\nhighlights guide above.\n\nAlternatively, follow us on\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pages/TrustedReviews/38275114220?ref=ts)\nand [Twitter](https://twitter.com/trustedreviews) to stay up-to-date with\neverything CES and beyond.\n\n**What’s the best thing you’ve seen come out of CES 2018?
