How convenient.\n\nThe device also looks reasonably slim, which fits with a previous leak that\npointed to a 6.6mm edge profile – that grows to 8.5mm in the middle, mind –\nthanks to the curved chassis.\n\nThe handset is large compared to the hand holding it, which gels with rumours\nthat suggest it will feature a 5.76-inch display.\n\n**Related:[Best Android Smartphones 2015](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-\nandroid-phones-1_round-up)**\n\nThe Huawei Nexus 6 is expected to launch this autumn, landing alongside a new\n[LG Nexus 5 (2015)](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-\nnexus-5-2015-release-date-rumours-news-specs-and-price).\n\nGoogle has yet to confirm any such details, so take this latest report with a\npinch of salt.\n\nWhat would you like to see from a new Nexus smartphone?
