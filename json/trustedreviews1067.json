But instead of using traditional currencies – like GBP and\nUSD – as a form of remuneration, Kodak’s platform adopts an all-new\ncryptocurrency, known as KodakCoin.\n\nThere’s more to KodakOne than a flashy in-house tender, though. Kodak has\ndeveloped an AI-driven image recognition algorithm, which has been tasked with\nmonitoring the Internet to ensure that images registered within the platform\naren’t being unlawfully distributed.\n\n**Related:[Best Bitcoin\nalternatives](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/bitcoin-\nalternatives-2018-xrp-litecoin-ethereum-value-price-3366640)**\n\nBuilt in partnership with British company WENN Digital, KodakOne – under\nKodak’s wing – will start selling off KodakCoin as part of an Initial Coin\nOffering (ICO), the name assigned to the round where funds are raised for a\nnew cryptocurrency venture, on January 31.\n\n“Subject to the highest standards of compliance, KodakCoin is all about paying\nphotographers fairly and giving them an opportunity to get in on the ground\nfloor of a new economy tailored for them, with secure asset rights management\nbuilt right in,” WENN Digital CEO Jan Denecke commented in an official\nstatement.\n\nKodakOne is a relatively practical use of blockchain, to my mind – and it\nwould appear a number of investors think so, too, as Kodak’s stock price\nspiked by 44% within an hour of it announcing the platform at [CES\n2018.](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ces-2018-live-news-\nhighlights-3350586)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n**Do you think Kodak’s hit the nail on the head with KodakOne?
