It’s essentially a step-up from HDR which\nitself is an improvement on standard dynamic range.\n\nWith the Amazon partnership, HDR10+ support will be added to the likes of The\nGrand Tour and The Man in the High Castle, with plenty more shows scheduled to\nget the treatment in the future,\n[according](http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/news/2017/12/12/0200000000AEN20171212002300320.html)\nto _Yonhap News_.\n\nUnfortunately, there’s no word on whether the HDR10+ treatment will extend\nover to the UK, though we suspect that will be the case on December 13 or a\nlittle later.\n\nFor people without the latest 2017 Samsung TV, it’s worth noting that some\nolder [Samsung 4K TVs](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-\nue49ks7000) from 2016 have an HDR+ mode which can upmix standard dynamic range\ncontent into having a form of HDR. The effect can work well on Amazon Prime\nVideo content, so while you may not get the full HDR10+ experience, there’s\nstill the option to get a taste of HDR without splashing the cash on a new\nhigh-end TV.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n**Related:[Best 4K TVs of\n2017](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-4k-tvs)**\n\n**Is HDR worth the TV upgrade?
