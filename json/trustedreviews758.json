Here’s a\nsnippet from our 9/10 review:\n\n‘It’s a JRPG delight that embraces the best of classic design and combines it\nwith some new and exciting ideas.\n\nThe lacklustre plot and underdeveloped characters are unfortunate, but don’t\ndistract from what is an otherwise fantastic package.’\n\n**Did you play Ni No Kuni 2: Revenant Kingdom earlier this year?
