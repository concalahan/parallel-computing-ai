Restarting the Apple Watch and iPhone pair didn’t help matters\nwhen tried.\n\nOne [Apple Watch Series 4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/apple-\nwatch-4) owner, Redditor ‘brazziliannutwax’, said: “So mad. My series 4\nliterally just arrived in the mail. I set it up then updated like a good ol\nApple fan boy and was greeted with A BRICK.”\n\nAnother sarcastically praised the update for turning their Apple Watch into a\n“nice, modern paperweight.”\n\nApple is apparently aware of the issue, and has pulled watchOS 5.1 from its\nlibrary of available software updates. The general guidance for users is to\nrefrain from installing it, should they have already downloaded it, until\nApple release a patched version.\n\n**Related:[Best smartwatch](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nsmartwatch-3434307)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Apple Watch 4](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n###  Bricked Apple Watch?
