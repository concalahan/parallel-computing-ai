A “large battery” is\nalso touted for the 5 Series phones, which would lead us to suspect the\nbattery packs will have a 3000mAh capacity.\n\nThe Alcatel 5 looks to sport a single lens rear camera which is unusual given\nhow dual lens camera arrays are in vogue and the Alcatel 3 Series phone has a\ndual camera module.\n\nSpeaking of which, the 3 Series is also a bit trim on details with Alcatel\nsimply saying it has a “large and high-resolution” display, which will feature\nin all handsets in the series. The 3 Series also appears to have a much\nglossier rear finish than the 5 Series.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nAt the entry-level rung, the Alcatel 1 Series is set to be the most affordable\nof the phones. sports a unibody chassis and larger bezels that handsets in the\nother series. It will also come with “higher-end features” which Alcatel notes\nincludes face unlocking.\n\nThere’s no word on pricing or release dates, or indeed how many handset each\nseries will have. But this is likely a teaser for CES 2018 with more details\nexpected to be revealed at Mobile World Congress 2018 toward the end of\nFebruary and the start of March.\n\n**Related:[Best cheap and budget phones\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-cheap-mobile-phones)**\n\n**Can Alcatel’s handsets compete against other strong budget smartphones in\n2018?
