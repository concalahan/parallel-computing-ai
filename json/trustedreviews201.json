At a special event in Cupertino, Apple unveiled the [iPhone\n8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-8-launch-event-rumoured-\nseptember-12-3269668) and iPhone 8 Plus, the successors to the iPhone 7 and 7\nPlus.\n\nShould you be looking to upgrade? Let’s take a look at what Apple has changed.\n\n**Related:[iOS 11 review](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/ios-11)**\n\n|  |  |  \n---|---|---|---  \n|  iPhone 8 | iPhone 7 |  \nScreen | 4.7-inch LCD | 4.7-inch LCD |  \nDisplay | 1334×750 (326ppi) |\n\n1334×750 (326ppi)\n\n|  \nAspect ratio | 16:9 | 16:9 |  \nRear camera | 12MP, f/1.8, OIS | 12MP, f/1.8, OIS |  \nFront camera | 7MP, f/2.2 | 7MP, f/2.2 |  \nChipset | Apple A11 Bionic |\n\nApple A10 Fusion\n\n|  \nRAM | 2GB | 2GB |  \nStorage | 64/256GB |\n\n32GB/128GB/256GB\n\n|  \nBattery | Not stated | 1960 mAh |  \nWaterproof? | IP67 | IP67 |  \nFingerprint scanner? | Yes | Yes |  \nFace/Iris scanner? | No | No |  \nHeadphone jack? | No | No |  \nData port | Lightning | Lightning |  \nWireless charging? | Qi | No |  \nMicroSD slot? | No | No |  \nDimensions | 67.3×138.4×7.3mm |\n\n67.3×138.4×7.3mm\n\n|  \nWeight | 148g | 138g |  \n  \n## **iPhone 7 vs iPhone 8 Design: What’s the difference?**\n\nApple played it safe with the iPhone 7 last year, deciding to keep the overall\nform-factor and size the same as both the iPhone 6S and 6. And again this time\naround there isn’t a whole lot different – all the big changes seem to have\ngone into the[ iPhone X](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-x-release-\ndate-specs-features-uk-price-2951157). Instead, the iPhone 8 looks very\nfamiliar. It has rounded sides and a Touch ID button below the display.\n\n**Related:[iOS 11 problems and how to fix\nthem](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ios-11-problems-3293849)**\n\nThe biggest visible difference is the glass back, which replaces the\n7000-series aluminium used in the iPhone 7. Apple has switched to glass so it\ncan implement wireless charging into these new phones.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n**Related:[Best phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nsmartphone)**\n\nApple introduced an [IP67](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/what-is-\nip68-ip-ratings-explained-2947135) water-resistance rating with the iPhone 7,\nand it’s good to see that that’s still here, but the iPhone and iPhone 8 Plus\nstill both lack a headphone jack. To combat this Apple includes both a\nLightning-to-3.5mm dongle and a pair of Lightning EarPods in the box.\n\n## **iPhone 7 vs iPhone 8 Specs: Which phone is more powerful?**\n\nApple’s iPhone 7 and 7 Plus were, predictably, the fastest iPhones ever,\nthanks to the A10 Fusion quad-core CPU, 2/3GB RAM and a six-core GPU. They\nwere, and still are, some of the fastest and smoothest phones out there,\neasily running any app or game in the App Store.\n\nInside the iPhone 8, there’s an [A11\nBionic](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-a11-processor-specs-\nperformance-benchmarks-3286346) chip, which is built using the same 10nm\nmanufacturing process as the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835, for improved operational\nefficiency, and 2GB RAM (3GB in the 8 Plus). Apple says the Bionic is 25%\nfaster than the A10, and it has the first Apple-designed GPU that’s built\nespecially for Metal 2.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIn our tests and after using both phones, the iPhone 8 is faster. It almost\ndoubles the scores in benchmarking apps like Geekbench 4 and feels super fluid\nin everything that you do. But, the iPhone 7 is still very fast and there\naren’t many apps available that really take advantage of this extra power.\nEven the intensive AR apps we tried out worked well on both phones, which is\ngreat if you don’t want to upgrade but annoying if you do.\n\nIn terms of display, the iPhone 8 is very similar to the iPhone 7. Both are\navailable with 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch IPS LCD panels with a Retina resolution.\nIf you’re after something a little different, the iPhone X has a near-bezel-\nfree OLED display.\n\nWhat the iPhone 8 does add is True Tone. This alters the temperature of the\ndisplay depending on your environment and makes it much easier to view in the\ndark. The iPhone 8 can also play back HDR/Dolby Vision content from Netflix\nand iTunes, for added contrast and brightness.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe iPhone 7’s 12-megapixel f/1.8 camera was good, but it was quickly\nsurpassed by the [Google Pixel](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/googles-\npixel-2-will-look-like-3176536) and then the [Galaxy\nS8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s8) and HTC U11.\n\nFor the iPhone 8, Apple has made a bevy of small changes across the board.\nIt’s still 12MP f/1.8 on the regular iPhone 8, and there’s a dual-sensor 12MP\ncamera on the Plus, but it now has better pixel processing, faster autofocus\nand hardware noise reduction.\n\nPictures from the iPhone 8 are great, with better saturation and much richer\ncolours. They’re not quite as good as the [Pixel\n2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-2), but this is one\narea you will notice if you decide to upgrade.\n\nThe iPhone 8 Plus has a new Portrait Lighting mode that’ll launch in beta, and\nthis adds a so-called ‘professional lighting’ look to your pictures.\n\nWhen we reviewed the iPhone 7 our biggest criticism was the poor battery life.\nWe struggled to make it past the end of the working day without reaching for\nthe Lightning cable. The 7 Plus didn’t have the same problems, thankfully.\n\nThe battery on the iPhone 8 is actually smaller than the 7, but optimisations\nfor the new CPU does make it last longer. We’ve managed to get about day\nwithout reaching for the charger.\n\n### Trusted Reviews Exclusive iPhone XS Deal\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n###\n\n[Apple iPhone XS – 10GB, £40pm with £350 upfront on O2\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\nGiving you plenty of data for the low price of just £40 a month, this monthly\ncontract with O2 is an incredible deal that can't be missed if you want to be\none of the first people to own an iPhone XS.\n\n[Mobiles.co.uk\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n|\n\n£350 upfront\n\n|\n\n£40/month\n\n[View\nDeal](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n£40/month\n\n|\n\n£350 upfront\n\n|\n\n[Mobiles.co.uk\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n## **iPhone 7 vs iPhone 8 Price: Which phone offers better value for money?**\n\nWhen it first went on sale in late 2016, the iPhone 7 started off at £599 for\n32GB of storage and £699 for 128GB.

The iPhone 7 has an A10 Fusion chip and 2/3GB RAM.\n\n**Price:** The iPhone 8 kicks off at $699/£699 for 32GB and $799/£799 for\n128GB.
