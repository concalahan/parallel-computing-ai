It’s supposedly a tribute to the\n“trendsetting metropolis” of Tokyo, and is designed to be spatially efficient,\nversatile, and connected.\n\nBut it ranks bottom of my concept listing, mainly due to the fact that I\ncouldn’t work out where the door handle was.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: Sean Keach / Trusted Reviews\n\n## 8) Honda Urban EV\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: Sean Keach / Trusted Reviews\n\nThe Honda Urban EV might look like a throwback to the 70s, but I reckon it’s a\ngreat example of simple car design working really well.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nSure, it’s not streamlined and low-slung, but it’ll stand out on the road and\nthere’s oodles of window space to boot.

I’m less convinced by the\nbogey-yellow paintjob, but I’ll assume that’s optional.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: Sean Keach / Trusted Reviews\n\nInside is where the action is though; the interior of the car has been beamed\nto 2017 from the distant future, and getting in is a bit like stepping into a\nTardis.\n\n## 6) Mini Electric Concept\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: Sean Keach / Trusted Reviews\n\nThe CGI renders have finally been made flesh (or rather, metal) with the world\npremiere of the Mini Electric Concept at the Frankfurt Motor Show.\n\nThe Mini has a seriously distinctive look, and even boasts quirky taillights\nfashioned after the United Kingdom’s flag. Oh, and it’s got an entirely\nelectric drivetrain, which seems to be particularly _en vogue_ at the IAA\n2017.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: Sean Keach / Trusted Reviews\n\n## 5) BMW Z4 Concept\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: Sean Keach / Trusted Reviews\n\nThe BMW Z4 Concept was announced a few weeks before the Frankfurt Motor Show,\nbut the wraps were taken off the swanky new 2018-year motor for all to see at\nIAA 2017.\n\nIt’s a glimpse of how the production version of the Roadster will look,\nalthough we’re expecting a few minor changes before it actually arrives on\ndriveways.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: Sean Keach / Trusted Reviews\n\n## 4) Kia Proceed\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: Sean Keach / Trusted Reviews\n\nI was genuinely surprised by how gloriously attractive the Kia Proceed concept\nwas; I figured I’d accidentally stumbled on a seedy corner of the Audi stand\nby accident.\n\nBut an Audi this is not. It’s actually an early glimpse of the next-generation\nCee’d hatchback, albeit in concept form – expect modifications before release,\nbasically.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: Sean Keach / Trusted Reviews\n\nIt’s got 20-inch, six-spoke alloy wheels, a long, tapered design, and a wide\nrear that’s reminiscent of a new-gen Renault Clio – but in all the right ways.\n\n## 3) Aspark Owl\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: Sean Keach / Trusted Reviews\n\nThe Aspark Owl is the mystery contender on the list, because I’m still not\nentirely sure it will ever exist.\n\nIt’s developed by a secretive Japanese company that’s promising a frankly\nludicrous zero-to-60mph time of just two seconds. That’s courtesy of a total\nbody weight of 1,900lbs, and an electric motor output of 430hp.\n\n> Award for most dramatic car at\n[#IAA2017](https://twitter.com/hashtag/IAA2017?src=hash) goes to the Aspark\nOWL [pic.twitter.com/50JUgFx9S4](https://t.co/50JUgFx9S4)\n\n>\n\n> — Sean Keach (@SeanKeach) [September 13,\n2017](https://twitter.com/SeanKeach/status/907923395467235329)\n\nBut will it ever actually drive on UK roads? I’m not yet convinced.\n\n## 2) Audi Aicon\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: Sean Keach / Trusted Reviews\n\nThe Audi Aicon is probably the most far-out concept car at the Frankfurt Motor\nShow, and it’s easy to see why.\n\nIt’s an entirely driverless vehicle that doesn’t have any pedals – or a\nsteering wheel, for that matter. Instead, it’s supposed to be an “autonomous\nluxury saloon of the future”, ushering in door-to-door individual\ntransportation that’s combined with “the luxurious ambiance of a first-class\nairline cabin”. Right.\n\nThis robot taxi might never make it to the road, but we’re impressed by the\npromised per-charge range of between 434 and 497 miles, and doubly wowed by\nthe purported 80%-charge-time of less than half an hour.\n\n> The Audi Aicon driverless concept – no pedals, no steering wheel!\n[#IAA2017](https://twitter.com/hashtag/IAA2017?src=hash)\n[pic.twitter.com/dmxmdzYoix](https://t.co/dmxmdzYoix)\n\n>\n\n> — Sean Keach (@SeanKeach) [September 12,\n2017](https://twitter.com/SeanKeach/status/907599799456813056)\n\n## 1) BMW i Vision Dynamics\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: Sean Keach / Trusted Reviews\n\nTop of the list is the BMW i Vision Dynamics. Why? Because it (1) looks\nawesome, and (2) will probably actually be made into a real car.\n\nThis electric-drivetrain BMW is supposed to sit between the dinky BMW i3 and\nthe aggressively expensive BMW i8, promising a range of over 600km (373 miles)\nand a top speed of 200kmh (120mph).\n\nIt’s also slated to zoom from zero to 100kmh (62mph) in as few as four seconds\n– whoosh.\n\n> Check out the supremely fancy BMW i Vision Dynamics concept at\n[#IAA2017](https://twitter.com/hashtag/IAA2017?src=hash) – and head to\n<https://t.co/CDcdIGZfJm> for the full story\n[pic.twitter.com/BsDOXQ4ovn](https://t.co/BsDOXQ4ovn)\n\n>\n\n> — Sean Keach (@SeanKeach) [September 13,\n2017](https://twitter.com/SeanKeach/status/907925628598530048)\n\n**Related:[Jaguar E-Pace](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/jaguar-e-pace-\nrelease-date-uk-price-specs-features-top-speed-images-2993596)**\n\n**What’s your favourite car from this year’s Frankfurt Motor Show?
