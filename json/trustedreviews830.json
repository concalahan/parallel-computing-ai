The name alone might raise questions\nabout the existence of an HTC U12 but to put those to rest, there is no such\nphone, unlike the [iPhone 8\nPlus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-8-plus) and [Samsung\nGalaxy S9 Plus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-\ngalaxy-s9-plus), HTC simply jumped from the [HTC U11\nPlus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/htc-u11-plus) to the U12 Plus in\na matter of months.\n\nYou can still expect Edge Sense (this time in its 2.0 revision), a stellar new\ndual primary camera setup and as a market first, no physical buttons\nwhatsoever (for better or for worse).\n\n## **HTC U12 Plus – Design**\n\nIt’s hard to talk about the design of the HTC U12 Plus without addressing\narguably its biggest flaw – its truly terrible haptic buttons. Basically,\ninstead of opting for regular mechanical buttons, HTC has used faux-buttons\nthat vibrate when pushed. There’s no physical movement when the buttons are\npushed; it’s just meant to _feel_ like they do.\n\nThis idea isn’t new – Apple does something similar with the iPhone’s home\nbutton – but it feels completely off here. The buttons are hard to press:\nthey’re not sensitive enough sometimes and way too sensitive at other times.\nThere’s also no way to alter the feedback levels – something that works very\nwell on the [iPhone 8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-8).\n\n**Related:[Best phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nsmartphone-3431175)**\n\n![HTC U12\nPlus](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAt my initial briefing, I was told that the sensation would become natural\nafter usage, but this hasn’t been the case. Following more than two weeks with\nthe phone, I’m still finding it difficult to adapt, and locking the phone or\nquickly altering the volume remains a pain. In fact, in certain situations –\nor when holding the phone in a certain way – the buttons don’t respond at all.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nThe fact that the functionality is particularly poor is a shame because the\nremoval of mechanical buttons comes with plenty of benefits. For example, it’s\neasier to waterproof the device – the U12 Plus is IP68 rated – and there’s\nless chance the buttons will become stuck or fall off. While I haven’t ever\nexperienced the latter, it’s always a possibility.\n\nAnother area where HTC has decided to go against the norm is with Edge Sense.\nFirst introduced with the [HTC\nU11](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/htc-u11-plus), Edge Sense lets you\ninteract with the phone by squeezing the device’s sides.\n\nFor example, a long squeeze could launch the camera while a short squeeze\nmight wake the Google Assistant. With the HTC U12 Plus we’re now on to Edge\nSense 2, and the biggest upgrade from the last iteration is that tapping the\nsides of the phone engages further actions. A tap on side can shrink the\nscreen to make it more manageable for one-handed use, while a tap on the\nopposite side can bring up a handy app-launcher.\n\n**Related:[Best Android phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nandroid-phones-3438996)**\n\n![HTC U12\nPlus](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAll these options can be customised, with the outcome of taps and squeezes\nchanged. It’s a nice feature, but one that still has issues. In my experience\nthere were occasions where the tapping action just wouldn’t work, and\nsometimes a much harder tap was required to engage an action.\n\nLaunching the camera with a squeeze is still the best use of Edge Sense, and\nis made more vital now that double-tapping the power key is virtually\nimpossible.\n\nAs usual, HTC has crafted a phone that feels every bit as good as the £699\nprice suggests. Unlike the [LG\nG7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/lg-g7), the U12 Plus feels solid\nand weighty. It’s supremely well put together and is finished to a quality I’d\nnormally only associate with Apple.\n\nWhat is less interesting is the overall design of the device. It’s cumbersome,\nwithout offering much in return. I’m more than happy for a phone to be thicker\nif the battery is fantastic, but this isn’t the case here.\n\nThe glass back might look interesting in either the glossy red hue or the\npretty cool translucent version, but my black review unit is rather dull. It’s\na fingerprint magnet, too, even more so than other glass-backed phones.\n\n## **HTC U12 Plus – Display**\n\nThe ‘notch’ has become commonplace on Android phones since the [iPhone\nX](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-x) and [Essential\nPhone](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/essential-phone-vs-\ngalaxy-s8-2950342), but HTC has refrained from adding such a feature.\n\nWhether this is a result of the design of the U12 Plus already being finalised\nbefore notches became a ‘thing’, or whether HTC simply isn’t a fan, only time\nwill tell.\n\n![HTC U12\nPlus](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nHTC has used a wide 18:9 panel in the U12 Plus and it ticks most of the boxes\nI look for in a flagship screen. It benefits from a quad-HD resolution, full\ncoverage of the DCI-P3 colour gamut and offers support for HDR. Viewing angles\nare decent and the panel hits a competent level of brightness – although it’s\nnowhere near the degree seen on the Samsung Galaxy S9 or LG G7.\n\nThe issue with the display is that it’s simply ‘okay’. The Super LCD 5 panel\njust can’t compete with the OLEDs that feature in rival devices. It lacks the\nperfect blacks and rich colours, plus there’s very limited customisation.\n\n[ Next  \nPerformance and Software\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/htc-u12-plus-performance-and-\nsoftware)\n\n"}
