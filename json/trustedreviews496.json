But what is it, and will you even be able to buy it?**\n\nFrom the latest news and rumours to specs, release date and pricing gossip,\nour guide reveals all.\n\n_The story of the Samsung Galaxy X goes back years, and you can scroll further\ndown the page for a full account of Samsung’s efforts in the foldable phone\nspace, and all of the reports that proved to be wide of the mark._\n\n## Samsung Galaxy X: What is it, and when does it come out?\n\nThe majority of rumours we’ve seen refer to a device known as the Samsung\nGalaxy X. The working theory is that Samsung has finally managed to\nmanufacture a foldable phone, and is preparing to unveil it this year.\n\nHere’s a quick breakdown of the key Samsung Galaxy X news and rumours:\n\n  * **Samsung Galaxy X Release Date:** A foldable handset built by Samsung will apparently be ready by the end of 2018, but might be revealed as soon as early November. There’s no firm release date for it yet, but 2019 has been suggested.\n  * **Samsung Galaxy X Design and Specs:** The main rumour is that the phone will feature dual screens and fold in some way, potentially using a flexible OLED panel and some kind of segmented design. This design could allow the handset to switch between smartphone and tablet form factors.\n  * **Samsung Galaxy X Price:** Considering that Samsung is rumoured to be limiting the initial run of Galaxy X smartphones, it’s likely that the phone would be extremely expensive − for some sort of context, the lowest-spec [Galaxy S9 Plus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9-plus) was priced at £869 at launch, so it wouldn’t be a surprise to see the X cost well in excess of £1000 when (and if) it’s made available.\n\n## Samsung Galaxy X: Design, teases and leaks\n\nIf ever there was a year that Samsung needed to blow everyone away with\nsomething genuinely new, it’s 2018. The company’s flagship, the Samsung Galaxy\nS9, has failed to match up to the firm’s expectations, and is on track to be\nthe worst selling Galaxy S device since the S3.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThere had been speculation that Samsung’s folding phone will be unveiled in\nOctober, but Samsung itself has − repeatedly − suggested the phone will be\nannounced at the Samsung Developers Conference on November 7 in San Francisco.\n\nThat hint initially came from Samsung Mobile CEO DJ Koh, who also revealed\nthat users will be able to access most of the device’s key functionality while\nthe handset is folded. In [an\ninterview](https://public.eagleapi.io/magpie/time-inc/trusted-\nreviews/AUTO/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2018%2F09%2F04%2Fsamsung-\nunveiling-a-foldable-smartphone-this-\nyear.html&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.trustedreviews.com%2Fnews%2Fsamsung-dj-\nkoh-galaxy-x-\ntease-3551425&vars%5BipcTags.contentId%5D=3551425&vars%5Bmagpie_data.ga_id%5D=1159076212.1538383863)\nwith CNBC last month, he said that for Samsung, “it’s time to deliver” a\nfoldable device.\n\nHowever, according to a new report from\n[Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-26/inside-samsung-\ns-bid-to-challenge-apple-with-5g-folding-phones), Samsung hasn’t even decided\non a final form-factor for the device yet.\n\nThis means that an actual, physical device might not appear at that Samsung\nDevelopers Conference after all. In such a case, DJ Koh and a team of\nengineers would instead present a “detailed conceptual image” of the phone\ninstead, the report says.\n\nSo what could it look like? The impression we’ve got is that of a device with\ntwo screens − one little and one large − which can be folded like a book. Koh\nhas said that users will be able to see things in greater detail when they\nfold out the device into its tablet form.\n\nThat rumour has been corroborated by Samsung’s latest Galaxy X teaser. The\ncompany posted a tweet this week, which includes an animation that shows a\nshort line (representing a phone) folding out to become a much longer line\n(representing a tablet). You can see what we mean below:\n\n> The crossroads between the present and the future – Samsung Developer\nConference is where you’ll meet the knowledge needed to stay on tech’s cutting\nedge.

According\nto Bloomberg, the company is struggling to decide whether a device that flips\nopen horizontally like a book, or a device that flips open vertically like the\nflip phones of yesteryear, would be better. The latter is allegedly the\ncurrent front-runner.\n\nThe X will reportedly open with a satisfying snap, much like the legendary\n[Motorola Razr](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/motorola-\nrazr-2018-new-2942133) and in testing, its screen is said to have recently\npassed internal tests of surviving being folded more than 200,000 times.\n\nSamsung and Google are also said to be working on a special version of Android\nfor the phone.\n\nKoh recently outlined some of the more philosophical design questions that the\nteam had to ask itself about the Galaxy X as it attempted to design a device\nthat should exceed, rather than simply match, the functionality of a tablet.\n\nAccording to the Samsung Mobile chief, the Samsung Galaxy X will be more than\njust a phone while folded and more than just a tablet in unfolded mode. “But\neven unfolded, what kind of benefit does that give compared to the tablet? If\nthe unfolded experience is the same as the tablet, why would they buy it?” he\nasked.\n\n“When the end customer uses it, [the company wants them to think] ‘wow, this\nis the reason Samsung made it’”, he added.\n\nFurthermore, other senior Samsung figures have also appeared keen to fuel the\nfire. “For mobile phones, we have to consider that this is a mobile device and\nso we cannot expand the size continuously without limit,” Byung Duk Yang, the\nhead of Samsung Mobile’s display R&D group, [told _Trusted\nReviews_](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-x-\nexclusive-3607742) (through a translator) in October.\n\n“There’s always an optimal size for mobility, and this is an area that we\nalways have to consider. Therefore, this is a matter of choice. We want, of\ncourse, for our screens to be bigger, however we don’t want to compromise\nmobility. It has to be mobile, and we have to strike the right balance between\nthe two.”\n\nHe added: “I would like to have a larger display when I’m reading a newspaper\nor watching a video, but I want it to be portable at the same time. As a\nsmartphone consumer myself, that’s something that I’d like to see.”\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Samsung Galaxy X: Specs and features\n\nIn terms of specs, the dual-screen Samsung Galaxy X is believed to be equipped\nwith a 7.3-inch flexible OLED screen that can unfold to form a medium-sized\ntablet, and a 4.6-inch external OLED screen (the phone display). It should\nalso come with an Exynos 9810/Snapdragon 845 CPU and at least 6GB of RAM.\n\nAccording to a September [report](https://public.eagleapi.io/magpie/time-\ninc/trusted-\nreviews/AUTO/link?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.etnews.com%2F20180918000327%3Fmc%3Dem_006_00001&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.trustedreviews.com%2Fnews%2Fsamsung-\ngalaxy-x-foldable-phone-could-lack-the-durability-of-other-\nflagships-3585006&vars%5BipcTags.contentId%5D=3585006&vars%5Bmagpie_data.ga_id%5D=1159076212.1538383863)\nfrom ET News, the Samsung Galaxy X could arrive without the Corning Gorilla\nGlass used to protected the displays of the majority of top-shelf handsets.\nThe firm reportedly plans to use a transparent polymer from Sumitomo Chemical\nof Japan instead.\n\nThis move would assuredly make the display more susceptible to bumps and\nspills, but would enable Samsung’s long-held ambitions to finally come to\nfruition.\n\nSamsung SDI managed to build a foldable battery four years ago, but that only\nhad a 210mAh capacity. Fortunately, the subsidiary is said to be getting close\nto developing one that could realistically power a smartphone.\n\n[According to](https://public.eagleapi.io/magpie/time-inc/trusted-\nreviews/AUTO/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ithome.com%2Fhtml%2Fandroid%2F367938.htm&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.trustedreviews.com%2Fnews%2Fsamsung-\ngalaxy-x-\nbattery-3501486&vars%5BipcTags.contentId%5D=3501486&vars%5Bmagpie_data.ga_id%5D=1159076212.1538383863)\nITHome, industry sources say it will run on a foldable battery built by\nSamsung SDI, which will have a capacity somewhere between 3000mAh and 6000mAh.\nHowever, Bloomberg claims the battery might have to be downsized, in order to\nkeep the handset’s weight down.\n\n## Samsung Galaxy X: Release date and price\n\nPreviously, there had been doubts over whether or not the handset would\nactually be released to consumers. However, it now sounds like it will be\ntreated to a global release.\n\n“I’m positive that we do need a foldable phone,” Koh said at the launch of the\n[Samsung Galaxy A9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-a9)\nin Kuala Lumpur this week, SamMobile\n[reports](https://www.sammobile.com/2018/10/12/samsung-foldable-device-double-\ntablet-phone/). “Possibly when we start selling the foldable phone, it may be\na niche market, but definitely, it will expand.”\n\nIt isn’t clear when it could hit the market, but early 2019 is a rumour we’ve\nseen on more than one occasion. Bloomberg\n[reports](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-26/inside-samsung-s-\nbid-to-challenge-apple-with-5g-folding-phones) that Samsung might not be ready\nto launch it until at least the second quarter of 2019.\n\nKim Jang-Yeol, the head of research at Golden Bridge Investment, has\n[predicted](https://www.scmp.com/magazines/style/tech-\ndesign/article/2150540/samsung-keen-claim-worlds-first-foldable-phone-launch)\nthat the handset could retail for north of $1800 when it hits the shelves.\nThat’s not much more than the top-spec [iPhone XS\nMax](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xs-max), but there’s also\nspeculation that the phone will, at least initially, be available in extremely\nlimited quantities.\n\n## Samsung Galaxy X News: The full history\n\n### **An early prototype**\n\nOn May 12, 2011, researchers from South Korea’s Samsung Advanced Institute of\nTechnology (SAIT) revealed that they had designed and built a prototype\nfoldable device.\n\nThis prototype featured a display that could be folded in half without\nresulting in a visible crease in the middle, by using advanced AMOLED screen\ntechnology. During tests, the researchers found that brightness at the hinge\ndecreased by just 6% after 100,000 folding/unfolding cycles.\n\nSpeaking to Phys.org at the time, HongShik Shim, a researcher at SAIT, said:\n“Our method has the advantages that mature, high-quality AMOLED display panels\nalready exist. But for real commercialisation, some new processes and new\nmaterials must be developed, which takes about 1-2 years.”\n\n### **Samsung’s concept revealed**\n\nThen in December, a video produced by Samsung was posted to YouTube, which\ndepicted a flexible Samsung AMOLED device.\n\nIn the video, the device looks just like a thin film of plastic, but it works\nlike a smartphone or tablet, running apps and making video calls. It’s a great\nexample of just how far back Samsung’s foldable phone ambitions stretch.\n\nCheck it out in the video above.\n\n### **Quirky tablet patent**\n\nOn May 2, 2012, it emerged that Samsung had filed a patent application for a\nsmartphone that could fold out into a tablet configuration.\n\nRather than a flexible display of the type we saw in the 2011 concept video,\nthis was simply a hinged dual-screen device – a little like a Nintendo DS.\n\nThe patent depicted the device as shipping with a stylus/pointer that could be\nremoved from the hinge.\n\n![LG G Flex\n2](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)_  \nLG’s LG G Flex 2 (2015) smartphone was an early example of a phone with a\nslightly bent screen_\n\n### **Development ongoing**\n\nFast-forward to November 2012 and the Wall Street Journal reported that\nSamsung was building handsets with flexible displays, and that they were “in\nthe last phase of development”.\n\nDevices carrying the displays were tipped to launch in the first half of 2013,\nand rumours even suggested the flexible screen tech would actually feature in\nthe Samsung Galaxy S4. They were well wide of the mark.\n\n### **Samsung Galaxy Q?**\n\nOn February 5, 2013, we heard news that Samsung was plotting a folding display\nphone called the Samsung Galaxy Q.\n\nThis handset was tipped to launch at Barcelona’s MWC 2013 convention later in\nthe month, and would reportedly ship under the model number GT-B9150.\n\nUnfortunately, that model number turned out to actually be referencing the\nSamsung Galaxy HomeSync personal cloud device (2013), and we didn’t see a\nfoldable phone after all. Boo!\n\n### **Flexible Note 3**\n\nIn May that same year, it was reported that three different prototypes of the\nSamsung Galaxy Note 3 were being tested, including one that featured a\nflexible screen.\n\nSamMobile cited an unnamed Samsung insider; the report confirmed that we may\nsee the Note 3, featuring the bendy screen tech, land at IFA 2013. While we\ndid eventually get a Galaxy Note 3, there was no folding screen.\n\n![Samsung Galaxy Note\nEdge](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)_  \nSamsung’s Galaxy Note Edge (2015) was the first time we saw a truly curved\nscreen from Samsung_\n\n### **Patenting a flexible screen**\n\nLater that month, it was discovered that Samsung had filed a patent\napplication for a flexible display.\n\nThe display was described as being able to detect the various ways users bend\nthe screen, including the folding angle or curvature. This would allow the\nflexible display to automatically adjust the image so it would be presented\naccurately.\n\n### **Another concept video**\n\nIn autumn, a video produced by Samsung was uploaded to YouTube, depicting a\nflexible OLED smartphone-cum-tablet concept.\n\n### **Official confirmation of folding phones**\n\nThen on November 6, 2013, Samsung announced that it would be bringing folding\ndisplay devices to the market at some point in the future. Unfortunately,\nthat’s pretty much all the detail it gave.\n\n### **Analysts spin rumours**\n\nIn early 2014, analysts tipped Samsung as plotting a new range of smartphone\nform factors, including a new Galaxy handset with a three-sided bent display.\n\nSong Jong-ho, an analyst at Seoul-based KDB Daewoo Securities, said: “The bent\nsmartphones will be rolled out as a Galaxy variant with a few million units at\nthe end of this year, initially taking aim at the nice market.”\n\nHe continued: “The bent device is the first step toward testing the market and\ngauging how it will react to foldable smartphones that are to be unveiled in\nthe second half of next year.”\n\n**Related:[Black Friday](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/best-black-\nfriday-deals-uk)**\n\n![Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+ Photos\n39](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)_  \nSamsung’s Galaxy S6 Edge (2015) was our first glimpse of a curved edge-to-edge\ndisplay from Samsung_\n\n### **Galaxy Note 4 getting three-sided display?**\n\nThen in late April, a report from ZDNet Korea described how the Samsung Galaxy\nNote 4 would feature a three-sided display that would let you view your\nnotifications at an angle.\n\nThis rumour turned out to be an early hint at the Samsung Galaxy Note Edge,\nwhich launched in 2015 and featured a curved screen on one side. This\ntechnology was eventually rolled out on flagship phones with the [Samsung\nGalaxy S6 Edge](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-s6-edge-review),\nwhich featured a completely edge-to-edge display. And that design trend has\ncontinued right to the [Samsung Galaxy\nS9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9) today.\n\n### **Samsung champions flexible screens**\n\nTowards the end of 2014, Samsung claimed it would be the only manufacturer\ncapable of producing flexible-screen phones during the next 12 months.\n\nLee Chang-hoon, VP of Samsung Display, said: “We will secure production\ncapacity of 30,000 to 40,000 [flexible displays each month] by the end of next\nyear. There will be no company [except Samsung] that has this great production\ncapacity by 2016.”\n\nHe added: “We plan to provide consumers with a product that has a flexible\ndisplay by the end of the year. However, nothing has been decided on the\nfinished product.”\n\n### **Another flexible phone patent**\n\nIn March of 2015, PatentlyMobile revealed that Samsung had filed for a patent\non a new kind of flexible device.\n\nThe concept paired a flexible display with a body made from a series of\ninterlocking panels. These panels could unlock and slide when placed under\npressure, allowing the phone to flex.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that Samsung actually filed for this patent way back in\nthe second quarter of 2014.\n\n**Related:[Best Android phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-android-\nphones-1_round-up)**\n\n![s8plusbeware\n21](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)_  \nSamsung’s Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ (2017) retained the curved edge-to-edge\n‘Edge’-stye display, but the bezel was slimmed down – Samsung calls it an\n‘Infinity Display’_\n\n### **‘Commercialisation’ possible shortly**\n\nOn March 24, 2015, Business Korea quoted an unnamed Samsung Display official\nas saying: “The industry believes that the commercialisation of foldable\nsmartphones will be possible in 2016.”\n\n### **Project Valley?**\n\nThen just five days later, SamMobile reported on rumours of a device being\nbuilt under the codename Project Valley, or Project V.\n\nThe report noted that the handset was in “the extremely early stages of\ndevelopment”, and that it could be killed off “at any time”.\n\nIt was claimed that Project Valley was a phone built in two parts that could\nbe folded together in the middle.\n\nBy September, SamMobile was reporting that the Project Valley foldable\nsmartphone would be launched in January 2016.\n\nThe handset was reportedly being tested in two hardware configurations: one\nwith a (then) top-end Snapdragon 820 chip, and one with a more middling\nSnapdragon 620 processor.\n\n### **Galaxy X rumours emerge**\n\nIn late spring, 2016, a SamMobile report citing Korean news sources detailed\nhow Samsung was working on a phone called the ‘Galaxy X’.\n\nThis handset was tipped to join the company’s flagship range alongside the\nGalaxy S8 and Galaxy Note 8 in 2017.\n\nThe Galaxy X smartphone was tipped to be the official name for the Project\nValley device that had been reported a year earlier.\n\nAccording to the report, the Galaxy X would look like a normal smartphone, but\nwould have the ability to fold out to double the size, to more closely\nresemble a tablet.\n\n![Samsung foldable tabelt\npatent](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)_  \nWe’ve seen plenty of foldable phone/tablet patents from Samsung over the past\nfew years_\n\n### **Two foldable devices?**\n\nThen in June, Bloomberg published an article that said Samsung was working on\ntwo new devices. One could fold in half “like a cosmetic compact”, while the\nother would feature a 5-inch display that could be unfurled into an 8-inch\ntablet.\n\nThe report noted that Samsung was planning to showcase the devices in 2017,\nand suggested that the handsets wouldn’t be marketed under the flagship Galaxy\nS brand.\n\n### **Wearable, foldable tablet-phone**\n\nOn June 30, 2016, a Samsung patent that was filed 18 months earlier was\npublished, detailing a quirky new phone design.\n\nThe patent described a handset that could turn into both a wearable and a\ntablet at a user’s discretion, thanks to a stretchable display panel.\n\n### **Galaxy Wings?**\n\nIn September, tech blog GalaxyClub published a report about a Samsung patent\nthat depicted a foldable smartphone.\n\nIn one of the patent’s supported images, there was a message written on the\nscreen of the concept device, which read: “Dear Sir or madam! Thank you for\npurchasing our Galaxy Wings today! Now you can enjoy our virtual keyboard,\nwhile having maximum space for writing and reading your emails. Enjoy your\ntime with Galaxy Wings!”\n\nThe device pictured appears to be a smartphone-sized object that folds out to\noffer keyboard extensions on either side, making it look like an elongated\ntablet crossed with a Bluetooth keyboard. Another image shows the device being\nbent over into a quarter of a circle, and even a semi-circle to be worn around\nthe wrist.\n\n### **Foldable tablet with a kickstand patented**\n\nAt the end of September, Samsung was awarded a design patent that detailed a\nfoldable tablet equipped with a built-in keyboard and kickstand.\n\nThe device had three foldable segments that, once opened, revealed a large\nscreen and keyboard.\n\n**Related:[LG G6 review](https://www.trustedreviews.com/lg-g6-review)**\n\n![Samsung Galaxy S7\nEdge](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)_  \nThe curvy Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (2016) was one of Samsung’s most popular\nhandsets of last year_\n\n### **Official foldable phone renders?**\n\nTwo months later, Samsung blog GalaxyClub revealed supposedly official renders\nof a foldable smartphone.\n\nThe renders depicted a handset that could fold over clam-style, but could\nstill be used normally like a smartphone too. Unfortunately, it was never made\nclear which regulatory body these supposed patent renders were filed with, so\nit’s tough to verify their legitimacy.\n\n### **Another rumour of two phones**\n\nThen in December 2016, a report from South Korea’s ETNews described how\nSamsung was working on two foldable phones, each with a very different design.\n\nAccording to the report, Samsung was following a “two-track strategy” with the\nhandsets. One device would feature a dual-screen setup that boasted a screen\non either side of a hinge, while another would ship with a fully flexible OLED\ndisplay.\n\nThe report also noted that Samsung would first release the former device to\ngauge consumer response, before deciding whether or not to push ahead with the\nflexible OLED option.\n\nThe dual-phone was reportedly set for a 2017 release, although supply would\napparently be limited to a “small amount” initially.\n\n### **Foldable phone rumours heat up**\n\nIn January 2017, the Korea Herald reported that “sources familiar with the\nmatter” said Samsung would “roll out more than 100,000 units of fold-out\ndevices in the third quarter [of 2017]”.\n\nSamsung was reportedly working on handsets that could fold out to form a\n7-inch tablet, as the company found devices that fold inwards were too\ninconvenient for users. Apparently, Samsung recognised that users wouldn’t\nwant to unfold their phone every time they wanted to use it.\n\nThe sources were quoted as saying: “Since the company already secured fold-in\nphone technology, it was not a big challenge to shift into the fold-out\nphones.”\n\nImportantly, the report noted that Samsung was still undecided over when to\nunveil the device.\n\n### **Foldable screens at MWC 2017?**\n\nIn February, South Korea’s ETNews said that Samsung Electronics and Samsung\nDisplay would demonstrate a folding smartphone prototype at Barcelona’s MWC\n2017 trade show later that month.\n\nThe article noted that Samsung wouldn’t show the phone to the general public,\nbut would instead demonstrate it to select invitees only. The device was,\napparently, able to fold inwards in the manner of a book.\n\n![Foldable phone\nconcept](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)_  \nSamsung released a video in 2013 depicting a foldable smartphone-cum-tablet\ndevice_\n\n### **Samsung enters ‘final stage of development’ – apparently**\n\nIn March, after MWC 2017 was over, a follow-up report by ETNews suggested that\nSamsung was working on “the final step of development” of a foldable\nsmartphone, with a view to building a working prototype in the third quarter\nof 2017.\n\nThe report suggested that Samsung showed an early concept of the device to a\nfew select mobile network providers, and was plotting to build “thousands of\nprototypes” during the summer, which would be used to test quality and\nperformance internally.\n\nSamsung was also said to be hoping to provide some prototypes to major mobile\nnetworks, with the aim of mass-producing such a phone in 2018.\n\n### Bendy phone rumours shot down\n\nOn April 2, 2017, a supposed leak posted to Twitter by a Chinese tipster\nsuggested that we’d see the Galaxy X foldable handset released before the\n[Samsung Galaxy Note 8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-\nnote-8).\n\nBut just two days later, a Samsung Display engineer poured cold water on\nrumours of a bendable Galaxy X phone coming in 2017.\n\nAt the Display TechSalon held in Seoul, Kim Tae-woong said: “Because the\nbezel-free display [on the Galaxy S8] currently sells well, we still have\nenough time to develop foldable display. The technology is expected to be\nmature around 2019.”\n\n### **Bluetooth certification**\n\nThen in July 2017, it emerged that certification body Bluetooth SIG had\ncertified an otherwise unknown Samsung device under the model number\nSM-G888N0.\n\nWe also saw the same model number device certified for Wi-Fi connectivity\nstandards by the Wi-Fi alliance earlier in 2017. Usually when you see these\ncertifications appear, it means a device is nearing completion and approaching\na launch date.\n\nHowever, there’s no telling whether this device is actually the Samsung Galaxy\nX, as has been speculated.\n\n### **Tough to find?**\n\nIn early October 2017, a report by Forbes suggested that Samsung’s quirky\nfolding phone might be tough to bag.

If you want\na piece of the next-generation of display technology, you’ll have to be fast.”\nJoy!\n\n**What would you like to see from the Samsung Galaxy X? Let us know in the\ncomments.**\n\n"}
