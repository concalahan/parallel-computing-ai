If we have a fully autonomousvehicle it will not be a vehicle that a person can go out and buy and driveevery day under every condition.“We will have autonomous vehicles but the first set will be in certaingeographic areas, maybe California or somewhere else. You will have a shuttleservice that uses fully autonomous vehicles.”Ford has been working on its own version of a self-driving car for some time,and recently announced it would be the first car maker to test autonomousvehicles at the University of Michgan’s simulated city, known as Mcity.The company currently has four autonomous cars, all located in the US, and isplanning to expand the team at Mcity to ramp up testing in the coming years.**See also:[Christmas 2015 giftguide](https://www.trustedreviews.com/hubs/christmas)**But, as Mr van der Jagt explained, it seems the first round of self-drivingcars which Ford will put into production is likely to be aimed at providing analternative to public transport.He added: “I think in the next decade [self-driving cars] will happen. Whetherthat’s 2020 or 2029, somewhere in that time frame you will see fullyautonomous vehicles.“But the first wave will not be privately owned cars. With the amount of carsyou have on the road you learn more and more and you get better control overall conditions. It is possible then, that in our lifetime families will havethese cars.”"}
