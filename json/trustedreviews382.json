So not radically different to existing HDR modes like\nthe one on the Pixel 2, but useful all the same.\n\nThe A12 Bionic’s machine learning prowess will also add rocket fuel to more\ncommon camera modes like portrait mode and portrait lighting, allowing for\nclearer live FaceTime calls, apparently thanks to the Neural Engine allowing\nfor better detection of faces and bodies when taking pictures and video. This\nwill also see fun things like Animoji look more cartoonish.\n\nApple’s A12 Bionic chip follows the 7nm fabrication process. The previous [A11\nBionic](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-a11-processor-specs-\nperformance-benchmarks-3286346) and Qualcomm’s current Snapdragon 845 CPUs\nboth use 10nm processes. Generally speaking, smaller nodes means you can fit\nmore components onto the same physical space, allowing for faster, more\npowerful processors.\n\nRecently, Huawei unveiled its first 7nm mobile CPU, the [Huawei Kirin\n980](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/kirin-980-features-release-\ndate-3548238), at IFA in Berlin earlier in September. Huawei quoted an\nequivalent 20% speed and 40% efficiency boost on its previous generation 970.\nQualcomm’s rumoured [Snapdragon\n855](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/qualcomm-snapdragon-855-3537526) CPU\nis also expected to be 7nm.\n\n**Related:[iPhone XS vs Galaxy S9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-\nxs-vs-galaxy-s9-3564946)**\n\n## Apple A12 benchmarks\n\nApple has yet to reveal any benchmarking scores for the A12 Bionic – and it\nmay never.\n\nThat said, a number of ‘leaked’ A12 benchmarks have been doing the rounds on\nthe internet.\n\nThe latest came from French site\n[iGeneration](https://www.igen.fr/iphone/2018/07/premier-benchmark-dun-\nmysterieux-iphone-2018-dote-de-4-go-de-ram-104545). The leak showed the A12\nrunning in with 4673 single-core and 10912 multi-core scores in the popular\nCPU-focused Geekbench 4 benchmark.\n\n**Related:[Apple Watch 4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-\nwatch-4-specs-release-date-3565562)**\n\nThe scores put the CPU above the A11 which ran in with 4087 single-core and\n9037 multi-core scores in Geekbench 4 in our tests.\n\n**Excited about all the new Apple goodies?
