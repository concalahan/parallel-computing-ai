Here are a few\nof the best:\n\n  * [Ryzen 7 1800X for £289.99, £10 cheaper than elsewhere](https://www.overclockers.co.uk/amd-ryzen-7-eight-core-1800x-4.00ghz-socket-am4-processor-retail-cp-39v-am.html)\n  * [Ryzen 7 1700X for £239.99, £30 cheaper than elsewhere](https://www.overclockers.co.uk/amd-ryzen-7-eight-core-1700x-3.80ghz-socket-am4-processor-retail-cp-39w-am.html)\n  * [Ryzen 7 1700 for £239.99, £10 cheaper than elsewhere](https://www.overclockers.co.uk/amd-ryzen-7-eight-core-1700-3.70ghz-socket-am4-processor-retail-cp-39x-am.html)\n  * [Ryzen 5 1600X for £179.99, £10 cheaper than elsewhere](https://www.overclockers.co.uk/amd-ryzen-5-six-core-1600x-4.00ghz-socket-am4-processor-retail-cp-39y-am.html)\n  * [Ryzen 5 1600 for £158.99, £25 cheaper than elsewhere](https://www.overclockers.co.uk/amd-ryzen-5-six-core-1600-3.60ghz-socket-am4-processor-retail-cp-39z-am.html)\n\nThese are likely limited-time offers and were correct at the time of\npublishing.\n\n## What is AMD Ryzen? The story so far\n\nRyzen is AMD’s newest brand of high-end processors, taking on Intel’s own\n[Core i3, i5 and i7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/best-intel-\nprocessor-core-i3-i5-i7-2937692) chips at their own game. The technology is\nbased on AMD’s Zen architecture, which runs on everything from the upcoming\n[Ryzen Mobile](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/amd-ryzen-mobile-laptops-\nvega-performance-price-release-date-2949002) for laptops, [AMD\nThreadRipper](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/amd-threadripper-release-\ndate-price-specs-3231747) high-performance processors and AMD’s EPYC server\nchips.\n\nThe announcement and subsequent release of Ryzen was important for a number of\nreasons. First, it signalled AMD’s long-awaited return to the PC gaming\nmarket. The company had been living in a very large shadow cast by arch rival\nIntel, which had happily been chugging along with world-beating desktop and\nlaptop processors for a number of years without any major developments. That’s\nnot to say Intel hadn’t made improvements, but year-by-year they felt more\nminor than many enthusiasts would have liked.\n\nAMD’s response had always been fairly muted, which lead to stagnation in the\nCPU market, higher prices for consumers and less innovation.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n**Related:[Best CPUs for gaming](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\ncpu-for-gaming)**\n\nTo put a number on it, the most cores you could get on a mainstream processor\nfor under £400 was four.\n\nRyzen arrived, launching three of its top-end Ryzen 7 processors, all of which\nhad eight cores and two of which cost under £400. Then followed six-core Ryzen\n5s to take on quad-core Intel Core i5, and finally quad-core Ryzen 3 to take\non dual-core Core i3.\n\n**All our Ryzen reviews:**\n\n  * [Ryzen 7 1800X](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/amd-ryzen-7-1800x)\n  * [Ryzen 7 1700](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/amd-ryzen-7-1700)\n  * [Ryzen 5 1600X & 1500X](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/amd-ryzen-5-1600x-and-1500x)\n  * [Ryzen 3 1200 & 1300X](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/amd-ryzen-3)\n\nIntel’s response came seven months later, as the company quickly launched its\n[8th-generation Coffee Lake\nprocessors](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/intel-8th-gen-cpus-release-\ndate-specs-price-2952599). i3, i5, and i7 became quad and six-core processors.\n\nYou can read more about the performance of Intel’s 8th-gen processors in our\nIntel Core i7-8700K review.\n\nAMD Ryzen works with the AM4 socket, which includes the following chipsets and\nfeatures you’ll find on whatever motherboard you choose to buy:\n\n**Chipset** | **PCI Express® Gen3 Graphics*** | **USB 3.1 G2 + 3.1 G1 + 2.0**\n| **SATA + NVMe** |  **SATA Express** ***** **(SATA & GPP PCIe G3*)** | **PCI\nExpress GP*** |  **SATA RAID** ****** | **Dual PCI Express slots** |  **Over-\nclocking** *****2**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n**Enthusiast** | **X370** |  1×16/2×8 (AMD Ryzen™) 1×8 (A-Series/AMD Athlon™)\n| 2+10+6 | 6 + x2 NVMe (or 4 SATA plus 1 x4 NVMe on AMD Ryzen™ Processor) | 2\n| x8 Gen2 (plus x2 PCIe Gen3 when no x4 NVMe) | 0,1,10 | Yes | Unlocked***  \n**Performance** | **B350** |  1×16(AMD Ryzen™)1×8 (A-Series/AMD Athlon™) |\n2+6+6 | 4 + x2 NVMe (or 2 SATA 1 x4 NVMe on AMD Ryzen™ Processor) | 1 | x6\nGen2 (plus x2 PCIe Gen3 when no x4 NVMe) | 0,1,10 | No | Unlocked***  \n**Mainstream** | **A320** |  1×16 (AMD Ryzen™) 1×8 (A-Series/AMD Athlon™) |\n1+6+6 | 4 + x2 NVMe (or 2 SATA 1 x4 NVMe on AMD Ryzen™ Processor) | 1 | x4\nGen2 (plus x2 PCIe Gen3 when no x4 NVMe) | 0,1,10 | No | Locked  \n  \n**Related:[Best CPU coolers ](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-cpu-\ncoolers_round-up \"Best CPU coolers\")**\n\n## AMD Ryzen 2: What’s coming in the second generation of Ryzen processors?\n\nHold your horses, we’re barely done with the first generation of Ryzen\nprocessors. But if we must look to the future, here’s AMD’s roadmap for its\nZen-based processors.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe next generation of Ryzen processors will likely run on a refined version\nof the 14nm Zen cores, called 14nm+. After that, possibly around 2019 or 2020,\nthe company will make the jump to 7nm technology. This depends upon 7nm\nfabrication being ready for mass production, which is still up for debate and\nrather out of AMD’s hands. 7nm technology is set to deliver even more power-\nefficient running and more densely-packed transistors.\n\nUntil that point, expect the second generation of Ryzen to be very similar to\nthe first, but with higher clock speeds and even better stability and software\nsupport. Hopefully we’ll start hearing more about that at the start of 2018.\n\n**What have you made of AMD Ryzen so far? Let us know on Twitter\n@TrustedReviews.**\n\n"}
