It was widely believed that the internet giant\nwas leading the autonomous car race.\n\nIt turns out, however, that Ford thinks it can go one better. Speaking to\nreporters recently, Ford CEO Mark Fields said (via\n[Recode](http://recode.net/2015/11/18/ford-ceo-mark-fields-is-trying-to-keep-\none-foot-in-today-one-in-tomorrow/)) that his company’s fully autonomous car\nproject could be on the road in four years’ time.\n\nThe potential obstacles, according to Fields, are legislative in nature rather\nthan technological. Having said that, Fields is confident that “Technology\ntends to lead all that.”\n\n**Related:[Driverless Cars: Everything you need to\nknow](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/driverless-cars-what-you-need-\nto-know)**\n\nFord recently announced that it had begin testing its autonomous car project\nat a 32-acre test layout called Mcity.
