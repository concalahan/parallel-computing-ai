A new genre has stomped its way through the\ncrowd to become a modern-day phenomenon. First came [PlayerUnknown’s\nBattlegrounds](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/playerunknowns-\nbattlegrounds), a title that quickly developed into the most popular game on\nSteam. Based loosely on Kinji Fukasaku’s 2000 movie Battle Royale, the game\nsees you take part in a 100-player online deathmatch on a giant island.\n\nThe second was Epic’s adaptation of its own game, Fortnite, which was\ninitially overshadowed by other shooters when it first launched. Epic saved\nthe game from fading into obscurity by adapting PUBG’s Battle Royale-style\ngameplay into a free-to-play game. It became Fortnite Battle Royale.\n\n* * *\n\n**Buy PUBG from[Amazon UK](http://amzn.to/2rGGOP1)**\n\n**Buy Fortnite from[Amazon UK](http://amzn.to/2rHPEvJ) |\n[Amazon.com](http://amzn.to/2DGpi31)**\n\n* * *\n\nHere in early 2018 PUBG vs Fortnite is gaming’s mods vs rockers; you’re one or\nthe other. Full disclosure, before writing this article I was a PUBG man. I’d\nplayed PUBG, alone and with friends, since early last year and saw no reason\nto explore Epic’s Pixar-tinged upstart with its building mechanics. But then I\nactually played it and found that, in truth, it’s a closer fight between the\ntwo than I’d expected. Here’s why…\n\n**Related:[Fortnite Battle Royale\nGuide](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/fortnite-battle-royale-guide-tips-\ntricks-3383586)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Blizzcon 2018](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n###  BlizzCon 2018: All you need to know before this weekend’s big show\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/blizzcon-2018-news-dates-virtual-ticket-\ngoody-bag-schedule-3603422 \"BlizzCon 2018: All you need to know before this\nweekend’s big show\")\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### This surprise free Undertale spinoff is a spooky Halloween miracle\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/gaming/surprise-free-undertale-spinoff-\nspooky-halloween-miracle-3613524 \"This surprise free Undertale spinoff is a\nspooky Halloween miracle\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Google Home Hub volume controls](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Google Home Hub security labelled ‘beyond dismal’ – Google rubbishes\nclaims\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-home-hub-security-risk-3613533\n\"Google Home Hub security labelled ‘beyond dismal’ – Google rubbishes claims\")\n\n  * \n\n## **PUBG vs Fortnite Battle Royale – Tension**\n\nTension is the crystallised essence of this genre. It’s the prevailing tension\nthat makes crouching by a tree for five minutes fun. The gradual stake-raising\nthat builds up each round as more and more hapless fools check out early and\nthe total number of survivors tumbles. If you didn’t care about that tumbling\nnumber, or feel the ever-increasing value of your own survival, the whole\nendeavour wouldn’t work.\n\nBoth games manage to create this, using quite different methods. To my eyes\nFortnite: Battle Royale has to work that bit harder to achieve tension because\nit’s seemingly played on an island from the Teletubbies universe and populated\nby refugees from Team Fortress 2. It’s disconcertingly cheery facade is the\npolar opposite of PUBG’s grim Eastern Bloc realism.\n\n**Related:[Best PS4 Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nps4-games)**\n\nFortnite: Battle Royale is tense, though, because its map is small and combat\nbreaks out frequently. If you can hear a gunshot, the shooter is probably\nwithin aim. That’s absolutely not the PUBG way.\n\nTension’s created by prolonged, unbearable silences in PUBG. It’s created by\nhaving everything drawn out – the space, the gunfights, the time until the\nzone shrinks. Perhaps above all, it’s created by being grounded so closely in\nreality. Jumping 9ft in the air and shooting a man with your purple assault\nrifle isn’t tense in the same way that a frying-pan standoff between two chaps\nin their pants outside a petrol station is. PUBG wins.\n\n_**Winner: PUBG**_\n\n**Related:[Best PC Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-pc-\ngames)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## **PUBG vs Fortnite Battle Royale – The maps**\n\nPUBG’s original map Erangel is an incredible place. It feels so _real_ after\nyou’ve spent a bit of time there, it’s a vast expanse that mixes huge open\nplains with claustrophobic dilapidated towns, ripe with potential dangers. It\nsays a lot about how expertly designed that map is that it sustained gaming’s\nbiggest community for almost a year, without any other maps in the rotation.\nAnd now Miramar, the second PUBG map, somehow dwarfs it, offering a welcome\ncolour palette swap, some camper vans, and yet more darkly picturesque\nabandoned towns to pick through for AKM scopes.\n\nFortnite’s map, as I’ve mentioned, doesn’t do it for me. It feels like\nsomewhere I’ve visited before in numerous fairly forgettable games. It’s a bit\nMinecraft, a bit Dead Rising, a bit – gags – Agents of Mayhem, even. As a\nplatform for the action it works very well, but there’s just no sense of place\nor atmosphere.\n\n_**Winner: PUBG**_\n\n## **PUBG vs Fortnite Battle Royale – The late game**\n\nThe last five minutes in a battle royale game can be a little hit and miss.\nUsually in PUBG it’s eight people laying prone in a field, moving glacially\nslowly until one ends up accidentally army-crawling over another, and\neveryone’s reluctantly forced to open fire. It’s tense but is it also\nenjoyable? Mechanically satisfying? I’m not so sure it is.\n\n**Related:[Xbox One X vs PS4 Pro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/xbox-\none-x-vs-ps4-pro-2993235)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThis is where Fortnite: Battle Royale’s building system comes into its own.\nThe late game is generally fought in a bunch of cobbled-together forts, and\nthat’s absolutely as great as it sounds. It adds an extra layer to combat,\nwhere skilful construction can give someone the edge over a more accurate\nopponent with a better gun. For a while, anyway.\n\nLate game fort-building is also the area you simply can’t bluff your way\nthrough as a beginner. If you’ve spent the round diligently gathering wood and\nmetal from trees and cards up to this point, it’s your time to shine. If, on\nthe other hand, you’ve been running around, shooting people, and trying again\nand again to find the ‘prone’ button so you can lay still until you make the\ntop 10 things will be hard for you.\n\n_**Winner: Fortnite Battle Royale**_\n\n##  **PUBG vs Fortnite Battle Royale –** **Cheaters**  \n\nThis is a purely anecdotal assessment, but PUBG can go to hell at the moment\nwhen it comes to being punched to death the second you jump out of the plane,\nbeing shot through floors, being shot from straight-up nowhere, being snuck up\non by Speedy Gonzalez, and being one-shot sniped by someone 6km away.\n\nIt’s a real problem. It was constant throughout Early Access and somehow feels\nmore acute after final release. Maybe it’s simply about expectations: you\nexpect a bit of jankiness and some dodgy deaths in Early Access, and when 1.0\nrolls around they stick out that much more.\n\n**Related:[E3 2018 latest\nnews](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/e3-2018-games-news-trailers-\nannouncements-2949170)**\n\nEpic has a similar problem with cheaters, and each month you’ll see news\nstories pop up about however many thousands of players have been banned.\nExcept Fortnite: Battle Royale is a free-to-play game, so who knows what’s\nstopping players from simply creating another account and masking their IP.\n\nOn a completely anecdotal level, I didn’t perceive as big a cheating problem\nin Fortnite. Perhaps it’s more about the way the game’s played – quicker\nrounds, more player interaction, more combat makes cheating less obvious and\nless annoying – but I’m chalking this one up as an Epic win.\n\n_**Winner: Fortnite Battle Royale**_\n\n**Related:[Far Cry 5 review](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/far-\ncry-5)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n##  **PUBG vs Fortnite Battle Royale –** **Anecdotes**  \n\nDid I say battle royale games were all about tension before? Don’t listen to\nme, I’ll say anything. Really they’re about their capacity to generate sweet\n‘dotes for you and your squadmates. Remember that time we steamrollered some\npoor guy while barrelling down the mountain in a Dacia? No? Well you would\nhave, if you were the one specific friend I’m thinking of who I did that with.\n\nThe point, naturally, is that PUBG is a deeply social experience, and its\nlongevity owes a lot to those emergent moments of spectacle and hilarity that\nseem to crop up every round. The same’s broadly true of Fortnite, just to a\nlesser extent. And that comes down to the art direction again, for me.\n\nThe aesthetic of Fortnite: Battle Royale is very much ‘Wheeeee! This is going\nto be fun, look! Look how much fun!’ And part of me bristles at that. _I_ want\nto decide whether it’s fun or not, alright? It’s like being told by some\noverbearing coworker to ‘smile, it might never happen! Hahahahaha!’ That’s\nFortnite’s cutesy look.\n\n**Related:[Red Dead Redemption 2 latest\nnews](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/red-dead-redemption-2-release-date-\nnews-rumours-and-trailers-round-up-2912356)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nWhen something funny happens in PUBG, it’s delivered with a standup comedian’s\ndeadpan. So you backflipped a motorbike and landed on your spine, downing you\nand your passenger? PUBG doesn’t say any more about it. You’re dead, pal. Back\nto the main menu for you. When something wacky happens in Fortnite: Battle\nRoyale, it’s that bit harder to enjoy because the game’s already tried to make\nwalking, jumping, and swinging a pickaxe appear wacky.\n\n_**Winner: PUBG**_\n\n##  **PUBG vs Fortnite Battle Royale –** **Tactics**  \n\nIt’s a win for the community as much as anything. Fortnite: Battle Royale has\nan entire extra layer of complexity in that building system, and it still\ncan’t compete with the subtlety of leaving a door open or closed in PUBG. The\ncommunity has employed all manner of sly, underhanded, Machiavellian\nstrategies to gain an advantage, from baiting houses by dropping desirable kit\ninside them and then waiting upstairs to playing dead in the prone position\nand springing up from under vehicles. It’s not that the game itself is to\ntactically rich, but rather that the players are so imaginative.\n\nConstruction is the outlet for that imagination in Fortnite: Battle Royale,\nand inevitably its best players make themselves known in that space. Shooting\nout base floors from underneath players is satisfying on a cellular level, and\nmaking a nice, friendly wall just in front of a downed squadmate to revive\nthem from behind is a hero play to savour. But they’re just not on the same\nlevel as leaving a door open or closed in PUBG. Sorry.\n\n_**Winner: PUBG**_\n\n**Related:[Gran Turismo 7 wishlist](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/gran-\nturismo-7-news-release-date-gameplay-trailers-cars-wishlist-3385860)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n##  **PUBG vs Fortnite Battle Royale –** **Combat**  \n\nThis is too close to call, despite the fact that these two games couldn’t feel\nmore different to control. PUBG feels like wrestling a sentient fridge into\ndoing what you want, and Fortnite is so slick and simple it almost feels\nflimsy. It comes down to whether you prefer adjusting zeroing distances on\nyour scope, or watching numbers fly off above the heads of your enemies as\ntheir hit points scatter through the air.\n\nHonestly, I don’t have a preference. I do know that Fortnite: Battle Royale is\na great big palate-cleanser after 100 hours of PUBG – it feels amazing to get\na few kills every round, even when you’re not playing very well. But winning a\nfirefight in PUBG is so difficult that it inevitably feels like more of an\nachievement.\n\nYou could make a case for Fortnite: Battle Royale being the more mechanically\naccomplished and polished in this regard, and I’d back you up on it if you\ndid, but that doesn’t necessarily make the fighting more fun.\n\n_**Winner: draw**_\n\n##  **PUBG vs Fortnite Battle Royale –** **Verdict**  \n\nIt’d be easy to look at Fortnite: Battle Royale and say ‘I bet they just\ncopied Battlegrounds because it’s so popular’, because that’s pretty self-\nevident. But Epic deserves a huge amount of credit for creating such a\ndifferent experience by tweaking just a few variables. It plays at such a\nfaster pace, with more of a risk-taking spirit. Add to this its lovely base-\nbuilding crescendo and you could easily justify playing PUBG and Fortnite\nalongside each other in the long term. They’re cut from the same cloth, no\ndoubt, but the results vary more than it might appear.\n\n* * *\n\n**Buy PUBG from[Amazon UK](http://amzn.to/2rGGOP1)**\n\n**Buy Fortnite from[Amazon UK](http://amzn.to/2rHPEvJ) |\n[Amazon.com](http://amzn.to/2DGpi31)**\n\n* * *\n\n_**Which game do you prefer?
