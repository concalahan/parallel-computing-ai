It’s early days for Destiny\n2: Forsaken, and there’s still a ton of endgame content to tackle and a Raid\nto polish off. Both verdict and score may be adjusted when we return to update\nthis review in the following weeks._\n\nAfter a year of huge excitement and [mild\ndisappointment](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/warmind-dlc-destiny-2)\nwe’re finally here, with an expansion that does for [Destiny\n2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/destiny-2) what The Taken King did\nfor Destiny. With Destiny 2: Forsaken the series is back on track, with a new\ncampaign that’s arguably the best Bungie’s done in years plus a ton of strong\nstory, strike and competitive content too.\n\nThis all comes at the same time as what’s effectively a reset for the game’s\nloot mechanics, ditching much of the stuff fans hated about vanilla Destiny 2\nwith a remix of ideas from the original game. Forsaken still finds Bungie\nstruggling to make Destiny all things to all people, but there’s a sense that\nit’s remembered what those who love Destiny love – and what we might love in\nthe future.\n\nAs with Destiny 2, the campaign content takes centre stage, kicking off with\nthe death of a beloved character – [you already know\nwho](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/destiny-2-forsaken-release-\ndate-3494283) – and sending you out to the Reef on a trail of vengeance.\n\nYour destination is The Tangled Shore; a general hive of scum and villainy\nwhere Fallen crime-lords mix with the Awoken, the Cabal are causing grief and\nthe Hive are lurking not too far below. You’re out for payback against crazed\nAwoken prince, Uldren Sov, and a hateful eight of his lieutenants, the Barons\n– a crew of miscreants, maniacs and Hive-loving monster pervs. Are you looking\nfor justice or revenge? Frankly, who cares. These bad boys and girls need\ntaking out.\n\n[**Related: Marvel’s Spider-Man\nReview**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/spider-man-ps4)\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n###  Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nAfter a lengthy intro act and a chance to explore The Tangled Shore, you’re\nsoon off to deal with the different gangs and crime lords, breaking the meat\nof the campaign into seven adventures and a suitably epic climax. Most take\nroughly the same shape – delve into a dungeon or master a series of\nchallenges, then get stuck into a massive boss battle – but what makes\nForsaken so good is that each sequence reflects the nature and proclivities of\nthe boss involved. Tackling a mad bomber? You’ll be defusing explosives to get\nto him and again while you fight him. Battling a master of mind games? Watch\nout for prank ammo and sneaky behaviour.\n\nTrue, most of the gameplay is classic Destiny – a combination of linear\ncorridor FPS action and more free-roaming stuff in wider landscapes – but\nBungie has imbued each chapter with imagination and variety, making each one\nfeel like its own micro-campaign. And where Destiny’s boss battles used to be\nfull of cheesing tactics and plodding, bullet-sponge adversaries, the new\nenemies are often smarter, faster and more devious.\n\nI have a love/hate relationship with boss battles which errs on the hate side\nwhen we’re talking FPS games, but Forsaken’s efforts feel part classic Capcom,\npart Dark Souls and part Halo, and I’ve enjoyed nearly every minute, coming\nback joyfully for more even when I’ve been worn down.\n\nIt’s not the absolute best campaign Bungie’s ever released, and some of the\nattempts to imbue depth and character to the storyline still fall flat,\nparticularly given some slightly, well, odd choices in the final stretch. Yet\nit’s compelling, interesting and crammed with great set-pieces. To my mind,\nit’s even stronger and more epic than either Destiny 2 or The Taken King.\n\nPlayers also tend to forget, or take for granted, how much work Bungie puts\ninto building worlds that are detailed, immersive, imaginative and frequently\nincredible. At times, Forsaken just looks jaw-droppingly awesome. It’s an\nexpansion made on a massive scale with an equally massive budget – and every\ndollar shows on the screen.\n\nThe campaign isn’t all Forsaken brings to us, either. We get returning\ncharacters, like Destiny: House of Wolves’ Petra Venj, plus a new Bounty-\ngiver, a Fallen crimelord known only as The Spider. We get a new class of\nweapon, the compound bow, which proves to be both versatile and a treat for\ngrabbing headshots with, particularly as it has a nice line in chargeable\nexploding arrows.\n\n**[Related: Best PC Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-pc-\ngames-3520096)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nMost importantly, we get a whole new faction: the Barons’ own private army,\nThe Scorn. Reanimated Fallen, they’ve got a nice line in bruising suppressive\nfire combined with brutal rush-and-smash attacks, making them a satisfying\nbunch of new opponents – and it almost helps that they look like refugees from\na Resident Evil game. Personally, I find them a lot more interesting to battle\nthan the Cabal warriors you most often skirmished with in Destiny 2. Finally,\neach subclass gets a brand-new skill tree with brand-new supers, and, as my\nTitan will tell you, there’s nothing better than rushing around a packed\nbattlefield, treating the Scorn to a face-full of flying golden hammer.\n\nAll this is great, but I suspect the thing that will really please long-time\nfans is the way the whole loot and weapon system has been adjusted. Out goes\nDestiny 2’s two primary (Kinetic and Energy), one power weapon loadout in\nfavour of a more versatile system, where some weapons you would previously\nhave considered Kinetic will now fit into the Energy slot, and vice versa.\n\nIn my experience, this actually means something similar in feel to Destiny’s\nPrimary/Special/Power system, but the choice is yours, and I’ve sometimes\nfound myself packing two hand cannons, two scout rifles or two autos, though\neach using different ammo and with different characteristics and a different\nfeel. Random perk rolls are very much back, so there’s no guessing what you’re\ngoing to get or how it’s going to work until you get out there and start\nblasting.\n\nIt’s a bit early to tell how the new weapon upgrade systems are working out.\nYou can still infuse weapons using older, crappier weapons or upgrade some to\nMasterworks using Masterwork cores, but you’ll need to grab more components,\ncores and planetary materials to do so, which has the potential to turn into\nsomething of a grind.\n\nAs far as the more competitive side goes, the big news is the addition of the\nGambit mode. Like Halo 5’s Warzone mode, it’s a kind of mash-up of PvE and PvP\naction, with two teams of four working to kill the match’s enemies – which\nmight be Hive, Vex, Fallen or Cabal – and bank the dark motes so released.\nBank enough and you can summon a super-beastie, and you finish them off to win\nthe round. There’s a level of risk and strategy involved in when you keep\nblasting and collecting and when you head to bank, as dying means dropping all\nyour hard-won motes.\n\nGot that? There’s more. Each team can frustrate the other team’s ambitions by\nopening a portal, heading into enemy territory and wiping out the other team,\nif they can in the limited time.\n\n**[Related: Best FPS Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/fps-\ngames-3526310)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nGambit’s got potential. It reminds me of CoD: WWII’s superlative War Mode in\nthat players can get stuck in without necessarily needing to be headshot\nchamps with ninja map knowledge, and the mix of co-op and competitive is\ngreat. There might still be some work on the balancing though. In the matches\nI’ve played (and there haven’t been that many) the game seems to swing one way\nor the other very quickly, so it’s going to be interesting to see how Gambit\nevolves.\n\nAmazingly, all this is just scratching the surface. I’ve already put more\nhours into Forsaken than I have many full FPS campaigns, yet I haven’t really\ntouched the endgame content, including a whole new region, and I’ve only\nplayed the new strikes – both great, if a little seen-it, done-it – in their\nbasic format. I’ve got boss bounties, adventures and quests stacked up to\ntackle, plus new Crucible maps on the horizon and a whole new Raid. In short,\nForsaken’s vast, making Warmind and Curse of Osiris look puny and even\novershadowing The Taken King. And you know what? I couldn’t be happier. Right\nnow, I just want more.\n\n## Verdict\n\nThis isn’t a definitive verdict. There’s still a whole lot to do and see in\nForsaken, and if we’ve learnt anything from Destiny 2 it’s that this is a game\nthat changes and evolves – or sometimes fails to evolve – as you keep pushing\nthrough the endgame content. How many of us raved about Destiny 2 in the early\ndays? Yet right now Forsaken seems to be taking Destiny in the right\ndirection, giving us that killer combination of Halo and Diablo that we’ve\nalways wanted.\n\nDestiny is always going to have its haters, and so much comes down to how much\nyou love the core action, the all-absorbing grind, the unmatched feel of the\ngunplay and your tools for wreaking havoc. But if you love those things, then\nbuy Forsaken. It takes us straight back to the glory days of The Taken King.\n\n## Score\n\n  \n\n"}
