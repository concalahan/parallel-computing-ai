It introduced the genre and series to millions of new\nplayers with its imaginative characters and unique setting, and that influence\nhad a lasting impact.\n\nNow, Square Enix is set to deliver a long-awaited remake, but as is often the\ncase with Square games (just look at [Kingdom Hearts\n3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/kingdom-hearts-3-release-date-\ngameplay-2993095) for an example), we’ve been waiting an incredibly long time.\nAfter failing to emerge at [E3\n2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/e3-2018-2949170), game director\nTetsuya Nomura has said production is “[going\nwell](https://gematsu.com/2018/06/final-fantasy-vii-remake-development-going-\nwell-moving-along-more-than-expected-says-tetsuya-nomura).” Hopefully, we’ll\nhear more soon in the form of news or even a new gameplay trailer.\n\n_Trusted Reviews_ has compiled everything you need to know about Final Fantasy\n7 Remake including all the latest news, release date, gameplay and more.\n\n**Pre-order Final Fantasy 7 Remake at[Amazon.co.uk](http://amzn.to/2nRGuHg) |\n[Amazon.com](http://amzn.to/2nJdRix)**\n\n## Final Fantasy 7 Remake news – what’s the latest?\n\nComments by Reddit user [Dan_Tsukasa](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dan_Tsukasa)\nfollowing an interview with Final Fantasy 7 Remake’s art director (via\n[ResetEra](https://www.resetera.com/threads/japanese-dev-comments-final-\nfantasy-vii-remakes-messy-development-while-outsourced-to-\ncyberconnect2.38709/)) goes into depth about the project’s allegedly messy\ndevelopment cycle.\n\nPreviously outsourced to developer CyberConnect2 before returning to be worked\non internally at Square Enix, apparently, much of the work from that two-year\nperiod has been scrapped.\n\n“They don’t have 4 years of work, they have 2. The announcement that square\nwas taking the game away from Cyberconnect2, they didn’t take it away and\ncontinue it, they started it again because cyber connect’s work was just so\nuseless and not far enough along, but still far enough along that remaking it\nwas faster than refactoring it… (it wasn’t in a good state at all),” Tsukasa\nexplains.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nIt remains unclear if the entirety of CyberConnect 2’s work has been scrapped,\nor if parts of the mechanics and assets developed remain part of Final Fantasy\n7 Remake. We imagine it’s the latter given the title’s presumed size and\nscope.\n\n**Related:**[ **Dragon Quest 11**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/dragon-\nquest-11-release-date-news-gameplay-characters-story-switch-ps4-3234483)\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nDespite these obvious setbacks, the interview debates that Final Fantasy 7\nRemake may be further along than we think. Although, you shouldn’t get your\nhopes up:\n\n“It could be far along, it depends how much they’re outsourcing and how\noptimised their workflow is. As the FFXV workflow was super inefficient for a\nhell of a long time, if that’s improved and if they’re doing things modularly\nlike I imagine then its certainly possible they’re far along with the first\nrelease.”\n\nSpeaking in an interview with Japanese magazine\n[Famitsu](http://blog.esuteru.com/archives/20016371.html), Game director\nTetsuya Nomura said Final Fantasy 7 Remake is ahead of Kingdom Hearts 3 in\nsome respects. Nomura, who is working on both projects simultaneously, has\nsaid some elements such as cutscenes are coming along nicely. However, he\ndeclined to comment further on development now it resides internally at Square\nEnix.\n\n**Related** ** **:[Best PS4 Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-\nps4-games_round-up)**  \n**\n\n![final fantasy 7\nremake](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## What is Final Fantasy 7 Remake?\n\nDeveloped by Square Enix, Final Fantasy 7 Remake is a complete reconstruction\nof the original game that maintains the iconic narrative, characters and\nlocations fans will know and love.\n\nYou play as Cloud Strife, a mercenary who finds himself working for AVALANCHE,\na terrorist group with plans to save the planet from Shinra, an evil\ncorporation ruling over millions in the dystopian city of Midgar.\n\n**Related:[Call of Duty Black Ops 4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/call-\nof-duty-black-ops-4-3373836)**\n\n![final fantasy 7\nremake](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Final Fantasy 7 Remake release date – When is it coming out?\n\nFinal Fantasy 7 Remake will be told across three separate games, which will,\npresumably, have their own individual release dates.\n\n“It will essentially be a full-scale game for each part of the multi-part\nseries. In 13, each installment told the story from a different angle. It was\nkind of like approaching an unknown territory in a sense,” Kitase told [Game\nInformer](http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2016/04/05/may-cover-\nrevealed-final-fantasy-xv-88376363045972.aspx).\n\nSquare Enix is yet to confirm whether each part will be a full-priced affair,\nor will follow a digital episode structure similar to something like Telltale.\n\n## Final Fantasy 7 Remake Story – What’s it about?\n\nThe narrative, characters and locations from Final Fantasy 7 are instantly\niconic, propelled into the zeitgeist of any gamer growing up in the 1990s.\nWith that being said, Square Enix is under a lot of pressure to deliver an\nexperience that feels both faithful and unique to the source material.\n\n**Related:[Upcoming PS4 Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/upcoming-\nps4-games_round-up)**\n\n![final fantasy 7\nremake](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nFinal Fantasy 7 Remake is intended as a direct retelling of the 1997 original,\nalbeit with a few caveats to accommodate modern generation standards. It is\nstill unclear whether or not all the locations and characters from the\noriginal game will make an appearance. Specific plot elements are also\nexpected to be altered in some way to be more relatable for modern gamers.\n\n## Final Fantasy 7 Remake Gameplay – Has it changed?\n\nCompletely reworking something as instantly recognisable as Final Fantasy 7 is\na risky proposition, but one Square Enix is more than willing to tackle. FF7\nRemake is making some major changes to the established battle system,\nintroducing a formula more akin to Kingdom Hearts or [Devil May\nCry](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/devil-may-cry-5-dmc-release-date-\ntrailers-gameplay-news-ps4-3334071) than anything else. **  \n**  \nThe turn-based battles that enthralled us in back in our childhood bedrooms\nare no more, replaced by a more actively dynamic experience. Combat and\nexploration now take place in real-time, much like [Final Fantasy\n15](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/final-fantasy-15-release-date-trailer-\ncharacters-gameplay-pre-order), so it’s safe to assume that battle transitions\nhave been removed entirely. Cloud and friends will now explore a world\npopulated by enemies as opposed to traversing a separate world map.\n\nConsidering the experience is to be split across multiple games, it may or may\nnot be open world. Exploration will no doubt play a part, but we may be\nrestricted to locations contextually important to the story as opposed to the\nopen-ended nature of the original. Hopefully, this isn’t the case, but as it\nstands, it’s far too early to tell.\n\n## Final Fantasy 7 Remake trailers – How does it look?\n\nSquare Enix has given only a few brief yet exciting glimpses at the long-\nawaited remake since its reveal at E3 2015. Here’s one of the earliest\ntrailers:\n\n**E3 2015 reveal trailer:**\n\n**Related:[Best RPGs](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-rpg-3523043)**\n\nThis is taken from the very beginning of the game, giving us the impression\nthat development is still in the early stages. That being said its wonderful\nto see such beloved characters remastered in HD alongside a remastered\nrendition of the orchestral score. The battle system is shaping up pretty\nnicely, too.\n\n**_What are your thoughts on Final Fantasy 7 Remake? Let us know on Facebook\nand Twitter @trustedreviews.  \n_**\n\n"}
