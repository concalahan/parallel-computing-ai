You\ntake the role of a Freelancer; a heroic group that act as humanity’s guardians\nand scouts beyond the wall in Iron Man-like suits of armour, known as\nJavelins.\n\n## Anthem release date\n\nAnthem has officially been delayed to 2019 to make room for [Battlefield\n5](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/battlefield-5-release-date-gameplay-\nnews-trailer-3231890) in October 2018. The upcoming RPG will now launch for\nPS4, Xbox One and PC on February 22nd, 2019, which is a little before the\nMarch 2019 release date EA suggested the game would have in a recent earnings\nreport.\n\n**Related:[Call of Duty Black Ops 4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/call-\nof-duty-black-ops-4-3373836)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Anthem Gameplay Preview\n\nBioWare is known for making expansive story-driven games, often RPGs, that\nfall short when it comes to combat. While delivering amazing narratives with\nplayer agency at the heart of everything, the Canadian developer has often\nstruggled to deliver a compelling experience on the other side of the coin.\nAnthem is unlike any BioWare game I’ve played. It’s meaty, it’s gritty and the\ngameplay is absolutely incredible sci-fi. Getting a chance to play it at E3, I\nwas blown away.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nAnyone who’s come into contact with Anthem has had their socks knocked off.\nEvery trailer and gameplay demonstration has been incredibly impressive, and\nplaying behind closed doors and viewing the game at EA’s press conference only\nfurther emphasised this point.\n\nThe suits that players control feel amazing. Everything in the game has such a\nsense of weight, aided by superb sound design where you’ll hear a satisfying\n‘whoosh’, ‘thunk’ and ‘slam’. It’s like _Pacific Rim_ meets _Power Rangers_.\n\nGetting the chance to drive the Ranger suit, we start the demo as it does in\nthe trailer, and immediately get the chance to fly through the lush jungle\nterrain. Flying is as cool as you might have imagined it from every\ndemonstration; it just feels so good.\n\n**Related:** [**Resident Evil 2 Remake\nPreview**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/resident-evil-2-remake-release-\ndate-gameplay-3261369)\n\n![anthem](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSteering is controlled on the right stick, while speed is handled by pushing\nup on the left. There’s also a barrel roll, which is superb for dodging enemy\nprojectiles, although the temptation to do it just for fun is ever-present.\nClicking the right stick allows you to hover mid-air to fire off shots at\nenemies, and you can dash-dodge shots while in this mode too.\n\nAll of this causes your suit to heat up; overheating will send you to the\nground. But there’s no fall damage, so it’s more an equaliser than a\npunishment.\n\nThe demo moved at such a rapid pace it became hard to keep track at times. My\n15 minutes were filled with explosions, intense combat against more enemy\ntypes than I could count, in the same mission you’ve no doubt seen in the E3\ngameplay trailer. The aim is to deliver Echoes into a giant relic, which is\nradiating some form of sonic beam, all the while giant robot turrets and\nenemies are doing everything possible to ruin my day.\n\nCombat offers a superb balance of making the Javelin suits feel super-powered\nwhile also making each enemy feeling like a tough challenge – if not\nindividually, then at least when they attack in packs.\n\nThe crowd-control abilities of each suit can also be combined to form combos.\nIf the Ranger fires an ice grenade into a group of enemies, then follows this\nup with an energy blast, it can cause huge damage to the unfortunate group,\nfor instance.\n\nYou can also combo together abilities with other players’ Javelins, but it’s\nreally smart design from BioWare that allows players to pull off combos solo,\nso you’re not entirely dependent on solid co-op gameplay to feel successful in\ncombat.\n\n**Related:[Devil May Cry 5](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/devil-may-\ncry-5-release-date-3334071)**\n\n![anthem](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThen there’s also a super ability, the Ranger’s being a rocket barrage that\nlocks onto a group of targets then unleashes a bevy of small rockets – it’s so\nsatisfying to watch.\n\nThe demo ends with us completing the objective. Unfortunately, we ran out of\ntime to move onto the next part of the mission, but even with this small\nsnippet of gameplay, Anthem did enough to show me how immense fun it is to\nplay in groups. In addition, there’s the promise of an exciting BioWare story\nto come. It seems like the developer is set to deliver the complete package.\n\n## First impressions\n\nAnthem is one of the most exciting new projects in years. BioWare is creating\nsomething unlike anything to come from its studio before, and the fact the\nteam is pushing the gameplay aspect – rather than narrative – to the forefront\nearly on in promotion is a smart move. It shows the team is well-rounded, able\nto deliver incredible action as well as a compelling story.\n\nI was in my element navigating around this lush world, watching a beautiful\nscene get blown to pieces and flying around huge expanses with absolute ease.\nFans are absolutely right to be hyped for this game.\n\n## Anthem news – EA Play trailers\n\nAfter teasing us with a [short\ntrailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9d4nOch4RY) prior to EA Play, EA\ndelivered a full cinematic trailer at its show just days before E3 2018 was\ndue to begin. You can watch the new trailer below.\n\nAs well as a new cinematic trailer, we also got to see some more gameplay from\nthe game as four players embarked upon a co-op mission together.\n\n## Anthem Microtransactions – Will it have them?\n\nAgain, following criticisms of Star Wars Battlefront 2’s microtransactions,\nfans are querying whether EA’s subsequent titles will include similarly\ninvasive forms of loot boxes. EA has since confirmed that it intends to keep\nmicrotransactions to cosmetic items only, and has also confirmed that Anthem\nwill not feature loot boxes.\n\n**Are you looking forward to Anthem?
