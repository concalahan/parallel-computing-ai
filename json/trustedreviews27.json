The powers can makeyour fights feel like a real comic book experience, letting you becomeimpervious to harm, deflect bullets back at your attackers, or letting out aburst of EMP to stun enemies and disable their weapons. I used severaldifferent abilities during my time with the game, and once you unlock the suitthey ship with, you can use whichever works best for you, giving you a lot offreedom to play however you want.## **Verdict**Marvel’s Spider-Man has a surprising amount to say for itself and continuesSony’s run of best-in-show first party exclusives. Comic book fans will fallin love with Insomniac’s loving rendition of the webhead’s Manhattan, but fansexpecting the next God of War might find themselves a little disappointed.Still, there’s a lot to enjoy here. It’s uncomplicated fun, and it shoulddeliver fun evenings defeating Spidey’s Rogue’s Gallery, exploring the city oreven just pelting around at high speed hoovering up collectibles.## Score"}
