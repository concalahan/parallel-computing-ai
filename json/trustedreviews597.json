As is typical with OnePlus, this mid-cycle\nupgrade isn’t a huge step-forward, instead focusing on tweaking what was\nalready there.\n\nBut should you be considering upgrading if you’ve only recently upgraded to\nthe OnePlus 6? Let’s have a look and see.\n\n## **OnePlus 6T vs OnePlus 6 – There’s a smaller notch, and a bigger display**\n\nThere’s two big headline features packed into the OnePlus 6T: an in-display\nfingerprint reader that replaces the traditional sensor on the back and a\nsmaller, less intrusive notch. Let’s talk about the latter first.\n\nOnePlus introduced a notch – the name given to that cutout in the display\nthat’s required to house sensors and a camera on thin bezel – with the OnePlus\n6 and with the 6T it’s making it noticeably smaller.\n\nLike the [Huawei Mate 20](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/huawei-\nmate-20), the OnePlus 6T has a ‘dewdrop’ or ’teardrop’ notch. Basically\ninstead of taking up lots of space, like on an [iPhone\nXS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xs), the notch here is a\ntiny droplet covering the camera.\n\nIt’s not going to be a reason for upgrade, but we must say it looks good.\nThere’s less intrusion when you’re watching videos and it helps improve that\nedge-to-edge feel.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![OnePlus 6T Midnight Black and OnePlus 6 red](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### OnePlus 6T vs OnePlus 6: Is it worth the upgrade?\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/oneplus-6t-vs-oneplus-6-3610116 \"OnePlus\n6T vs OnePlus 6: Is it worth the upgrade?\")\n\n  * [ ![OnePlus 6T head on](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### OnePlus 6T launches with Screen Unlock and heftiest price tag yet\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/oneplus-6t-release-date-3525032 \"OnePlus\n6T launches with Screen Unlock and heftiest price tag yet\")\n\n  *   * [ ![OnePlus 6T 3/4 view](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### OnePlus 6T review: Is it still the ‘flagship killer’ to beat?\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/oneplus-6t \"OnePlus 6T review: Is it\nstill the ‘flagship killer’ to beat?\")\n\n  * \n\n**Related:[Best smartphones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nsmartphone-3431175)**\n\n![OnePlus 6T handheld S pattern Midnight\nBlack](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe switch means OnePlus has said farewell to the notification LED and moved\nthe microphones/speaker onto the top of the device. In reality you’re losing\nvery little.\n\nThe display is also slightly bigger (6.4-inches rather than 6.3) however\neverything else remains the same:\n[OLED](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/oled-vs-led-lcd-2924602) display\ntech, FHD+ resolution and a variety of screen modes to choose from.\n\nThe notch isn’t the only visual difference between the two phones. The OnePlus\n6T won’t ship in white or red – just a glossy or a matte black – and the\nfingerprint sensor on the back is no-longer there. The headphone jack, has\nalso been ditched to make room for a larger battery and the in-display\nfingerprint sensor.\n\n## **OnePlus 6T vs OnePlus 6 – Are in-display fingerprint sensors the\nfuture?**\n\nUnder the OnePlus 6T’s display is a bunch of tech, including a camera, that’ll\nread your fingerprint and unlock the phone when you touch the glowing green\nsymbol on the display.\n\nAside from being futuristic, the in-display fingerprint reader works well and\nfunctions pretty much just like a traditional sensor. It’s a tad slower\nthough, and arguably not quite as reliable – but it’s better than some other\nimplementations we’ve tried.\n\n**Related:[Best Android phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nandroid-phones-3438996)**\n\n![OnePlus 6T Midnight Black and OnePlus 6\nred](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe OnePlus 6 has a more traditional fingerprint scanner that sits on its\nback, below the rear camera.\n\nBoth phones utilise similar face unlock methods and that means there’s no 3D\nface scanning or any fancy biometric tech here. Still, face unlock remains\nvery quick even if it lacks the security of the in-display fingerprint sensor.\n\n## **OnePlus 6T vs OnePlus 6 – Bigger battery, similar specs**\n\nOnePlus has kept the spec-sheet pretty much the same for the OnePlus 6T when\nyou compare it to the 6. Both pack a [Snapdragon\n845](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/snapdragon-845-benchmark-phones-\nspeed-3390981), 6/8GB RAM, USB-C Fast Charge and lack expandable storage. The\nbase 64GB option has been ditched though, so 128GB is the new default.\n\nThe camera remains the same, too. One 16-megapixel f/1.7 and one 20-megapixel\ncamera sit on the back (the second helps the portrait mode) and while these\naren’t the finest shooters around, a couple of software updates have made them\nbetter over time. OnePlus has also added a dedicated low-light mode.\n\nThis means things like Qi charging (a feature found in more and more high-end\nAndroid phones) and an official IP-rating are still nowhere to be found. Maybe\nwe’ll those additions, along with 5G, for the [OnePlus\n7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/oneplus-7-specs-release-date-\nfeatures-3609032) when that likely debuts sometime in 2019.\n\nYou do, however, get a larger 3700 mAh battery which is up from the 6’s 3300\nmAh. It’s a nice bump that gives the phone some extra endurance.\n\nBoth phones use Android 9 Pie, with a smattering of OnePlus tweaks. There’s a\nbit more customisability with user-selected icons and a ‘Shelf’ for storing\napps, shortcuts and widgets.\n\n| **OnePlus 6T** | **OnePlus 6**  \n---|---|---  \n**Dimensions** |  157.5 x 74.8 x 8.2mm | 155.7 x 75.4 x 7.8mm  \n**Weight** |  185 grams | 177 grams  \n**Display** |  6.41-inch AMOLED, 19.5:9 ratio, sRGB, DCI-P3, Full HD+ (2340 x\n1080) display w/ Gorilla Glass 6 | 6.28-inch AMOLED, 19.5:9 ratio, sRGB,\nDCI-P3, Full HD+ (2340 x 1080) display w/ Gorilla Glass 5  \n**Processor** |  Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 | Qualcomm Snapdragon 845  \n**RAM** |  6GB/8GB | 6GB/8GB  \n**Rear camera** |  Dual 16 + 20-megapixel camera | Dual 16 + 20-megapixel\ncamera  \n**Front camera** |  Single 16-megapixel camera | Single 16-megapixel camera  \n**Battery** |  3700mAh | 3300mAh  \n**Software** |  Android 9.0 Pie w/ OxygenOS | Android 9.0 Pie w/ OxygenOS  \n**Storage** |  128GB/256GB.

But, at £499\nit’s still seriously good value for what you’re getting. That £499 gets you\n6GB RAM/128GB storage, with £529 upping that RAM to 8GB. Spend £579 and you’ll\nget 256GB/8GB RAM.\n\nThe price increase over the OnePlus 6 isn’t huge. That phone retailed for £469\nwhen it launched (however you’d only get 6GB RAM/64GB there) with a £519\nversion offer 8GB RAM and 128GB storage.\n\nIf you’ve recently picked up the OnePlus 6 we wouldn’t suggest upgrading right\naway, especially if you’re happy with it. The in-display is nice and the notch\ncertainly is less intrusive, but those features aside there isn’t much new.\nThere’s also some bits, the headphone jack for example, that you’ll lose in\nthe upgrade. This phone is more for those on older OnePlus phones and Android\ndevices in general.\n\n**Will you be upgrading your OnePlus 6 to the OnePlus 6T? Let us know\n@trustedreviews**\n\n"}
