Now it’s time\nto find out whether the Moto G6 has got what it takes.\n\nFor the £220 asking price, Motorola has extended the 5.7-inch today to inhabit\nan 18:9 aspect ratio complete with improved Full HD+ resolution. Facial\nrecognition now joins the phone’s fingerprint sensor with regards to\nunlocking, there’s USB-C fast-charging on-hand and the new rear dual cameras\nare set within a fresh, curved glass and metal design.\n\nOn paper, it looks as though the Moto G6 offers more bang for your buck than\nany previous G-series phone.\n\nIf you’re looking for something slightly cheaper the [Moto G6\nPlay](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/moto-g6-play) has a plastic body\nand a lower-res camera while remaining an excellent phone. The other entry in\nthe G-series is the [Moto G6\nPlus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/moto-g6-plus) – this has a faster\nprocessor and better camera.\n\n**Related:[Is the OnePlus 6 the ultimate budget\nsmartphone?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/oneplus-6)**\n\n## **Moto G6 – Design**\n\nFollowing the current smartphone trend, the Moto G6 has an 18:9 screen ratio,\nmeaning the screen is taller and narrower than before. This is great for\nwatching widescreen movies or TV, and makes sense from a design perspective,\ntoo; a wide phone is more difficult to use than a taller device.\n\n**Related:[Best budget phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-cheap-\nmobile-phones-3430364)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n![Moto G6](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe Moto G6 is slimmer than its predecessor, too, while packing a much larger\nscreen. It’s far easier to slip into your pocket.\n\nIt appears that Motorola has even upped the quality of materials used for the\ndevice. The Moto G6 sports a metal frame that’s sandwiched between the screen\non one side and curved, scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass on the other. Previous\nMoto G devices have had housings that are mainly plastic, and while they’ve\nbeen fine, the Moto G6 feels much better.\n\nThere’s a whiff of [Samsung Galaxy\nS9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9) about the design\n– never a bad thing – but the Moto G6 feels lighter.\n\nA nicely bevelled power button sits on the side, and it’s flanked by a clicky\nvolume rocker. A USB-C port and headphone jack can be found along the bottom.\nBelow the display is a long and thin fingerprint scanner/home button and a\nslightly unnecessary Motorola logo.\n\n![Moto G6](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe Moto G6 lacks any water-resistance, however. There’s an added coating that\noffers some resistance against splashes and rain, but don’t expect this to\nprotect against an accidental dunking in a bath.\n\n## **Moto G6 – Screen**\n\nHandsets in this price-range often sacrifice a good display to try to keep\ncosts down. However, when you consider the length of time we spend glued to\nour phone screens, I’d much prefer a quality screen over, say, a few extra\ngigabytes of RAM and greater internal storage. Thankfully, the Moto G6’s\ndisplay is very good.\n\nThe 18:9, 5.7-inch IPS LCD panel is taller than that featured on the Moto G5,\nand to fill the extra space resolution has been bumped up slightly from FHD to\nFHD+. At this size, you’re unlikely to notice the difference between this and\na QHD+ toting display – unless you get in super-close, that is – and we’re yet\nto see OLED panels really impress at this end of the market.\n\nThat high resolution makes for detailed reproduction of images and videos,\nwith individual pixels that are impossible to spot. Combine this with the\nsuper-wide display and the Moto G6 is great for watching Netflix and YouTube.\n\n![Moto G6](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIt isn’t the brightest screen around; you’ll want either to enable auto-\nbrightness or manually jack it up in the settings panel to improve outdoor\nvisibility. Viewing angles are surprisingly good, however.\n\nAnother slight niggle is that by default the screen is a little on the cool\nside: whites take on a slight blue hue; it just feels a little cold. However,\nwhether or not this is an issue is a matter of personal preference, rather\nthan there being something _wrong_ with the display. If it annoys, I’d\nrecommend you head into settings for a tweak.\n\n[ Next  \nPerformance and Software\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/moto-g6-performance-and-software)\n\n"}
