It sits alongside the [Signa\nSolo](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/polk-signa-solo) as part of Polk\nAudio’s current soundbar range.\n\nDimensions for the soundbar are 6 x 90 x 8cm (hwd), so it should fit beneath\nyour TV without obscuring the IR remote sensor. It ships with HDMI and optical\ncables and also features Bluetooth connectivity and a 3.5mm AUX input.\n\n**Related:[Best Soundbar 2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nsoundbar-3450266)**\n\nPolk claims the soundbar and subwoofer are capable of delivering a “rich sound\nand deep bass” through its Dolby Digital decoding and a “performance-tuned\ndriver array”. That should give your TV much more of a presence than the set’s\nstandard speakers. It also features what Polk refers to as its VoiceAdjust\ntechnology, which allows the user to customise voice levels to their liking.\n\nThe listening experience can be further tailored through a number of one-\nbutton EQ presets that include ‘Movies’, ‘Music’ and ‘Night’ modes.\n\nCompatible with 4K and HDTVs, the Signa S2 comes in a black finish and is\navailable now for £199.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n**Does the Signa S2 sound appealing to you?
