By expanding upon the blueprint established by Origins,\nUbisoft has crafted an experience that feels brave, huge and utterly\ngargantuan.\n\n## Pros\n\n  * Ancient Greece is a big, bold and beautiful setting\n  * Combat and exploration frequently encourage experimentation\n  * Kassandra and Alexios are a great duo of protagonists\n  * You can be a cool gay warrior lady\n\n## Cons\n\n  * Dialogue choices and performances are inconsistent\n  * Romantic relationship options feel forced and unnecessary\n  * Core narrative is underwhelming at times\n\n## Key Features\n\n  * Review Price: £49.99\n  * Release Date: October 5, 2018\n  * Developer: Ubisoft Quebec\n  * Genre: Action\n\nAssassin’s Creed Odyssey is an expansion of the template Ubisoft set with\n[Assassin’s Creed Origins](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/assassins-\ncreed-origins). It borrows from the best and brightest of open-world design to\ncraft an experience that is, at times, truly outstanding. The islands of\nAncient Greece have been recreated with startling scale, boasting an attention\nto detail so vast that it’s genuinely overwhelming.\n\nNot everything in Odyssey’s world is worth exploring, nor are its virgin\nattempts at Mass Effect-esque dialogue and romantic relationship mechanics.\nIt’s obvious that Ubisoft is teething through new ideas, throwing myriad\nthings at the wall and seeing what sticks. Some of it does, while others fall\nto the ground with a distinct lack of grace\n\nDespite this, Assassin’s Creed Odyssey still manages to boast an incredible\nopen-world adventure that strikes a stellar balance between virtual tourism of\nhistorical locations and a silly, over-the-top adventure that seldom takes\nitself too seriously.\n\n**Related:**[ **Best Gaming\nKeyboards**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-gaming-keyboard-3500376)\n\n![Assassin's Creed\nOdyssey](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nYou play as either Alexios or Kassandra, descendants of legendary spartan\n[Leonidas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZeYVIWz99I), as they fight the\nTemplars – a group of evildoers who continue to act as the series’ main\nantagonists, despite still forming throughout this instalment. I took on the\nrole of Kassandra, who is easily the most charismatic and interesting of the\ntwo protagonists.\n\nWhen dialogue fails to deliver, which it often does, her stellar portrayal and\nevident charm oftentimes steal the show. How she behaves is decided by the\nplayer, with a handful of options available in all conversations. They\nnormally follow a binary choice of good or evil, with many quests tasking you\nwith killing an enemy or showing mercy and letting them go.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nOdyssey also marks the first time you can engage in romantic relationships,\nregardless of gender. It’s a welcome step for innovation in mainstream\nblockbusters, although the way it’s used here is relatively infantile. It’s\noften an object of comedy or a reward for the player after completing a\nsidequest.\n\nIt’s always consensual, and comedic moments are executed well, but I can’t\nhelp but feel it’s a bit of an afterthought. Like many of Odyssey’s debut\nelements, it’s clear Ubisoft is still finding its feet in a medium where many\nof its features have been executed far better.\n\nThe main narrative is passable, peppered with stunning set pieces that left a\nsmile on my face, but inconsistent pacing and performances prevent it from\nbeing something great.\n\n**Related:**[ **Best Xbox One\nGames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/xbox-one-games-3435271)\n\n![Assassin's Creed\nOdyssey](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIf you played Assassin’s Creed Origins, you’ll feel right at home here. Within\nseconds the controls felt like an extension of myself as everything I learnt\nin Ancient Egypt came flooding back. Exploration is underpinned by the same\nelements the series has used for years. You’re either exploring the world by\nhorseback or clambering up every building in sight.\n\nMuch like Origins, climbing is simplified, executed with a single button.\nThere’s no challenge involved, satisfaction relegated to the gorgeous views on\ndisplay when synchronising viewpoints rather than the thrill of the climb.\nHowever, despite taking a backseat in recent installments, sailing is back in\na big way. Your vessel can be upgraded by collecting salvage from enemy ships,\nwhich you’ll best in combat through fun yet simplistic encounters.\n\nExploring the Greek Islands is a frequent joy, and discovering new locations\nis encouraged as you surpass the level threshold required to conquer even the\nhardest of areas. They’re packed with an abundance of side quests and points\nof interest, although the latter become little more than busywork.\n\n**Related:**[ **Best Gaming\nHeadsets**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-gaming-headsets-3431813)\n\n![Assassin's Creed\nOdyssey](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCombat is an absolute blast, ripe with enough customisation for strategy that\nI didn’t grow bored of things even after 30+ hours of play. Aggression is\nrecommended as you dedicate ability points to a selection of skills. These can\nrange from setting your weapons aflame to unleashing a flurry of arrows onto a\ngroup of unsuspecting foes.\n\nSplit into three distinct categories – Hunter, Assassin and Warrior – I found\nmyself approaching most conflicts with a unique mindset of skills to pull off.\nEven the most pedestrian of encounters could be twisted into an experimental\ndelight as I lured foes to their death through a plethora of exhilarating\nabilities. That kick from 300? Leonidas must have passed it down through the\nages because his descendants can do that.\n\nYou can’t just hack your way to victory either, as many enemies have shields\nwhich require either a heavy weapon or shield breaker to deal with. Most\nskirmishes aren’t particularly challenging unless you deliberately fight\nhigher-level adversaries or partake in Conquest Battles – huge encounters that\nbecome available once you’ve wiped out the leadership of each isle.\n\nWhile enjoyable, the impact these have on the world you explore feels\nnegligible, so I didn’t see a point engaging with them. Odyssey suffers from\nthis in many areas, failing to make your place in the world feel meaningful\nbeyond the wider narrative at play.\n\nOne point saw me stumble into Athens where a plague had apparently overcome\nthe populus. I had no idea, and the environmental cues made it equally\nunclear. This, combined with mediocre scripting, twists presumably epic\nmoments into farces of incidental hilarity. It is clear that the systems\nUbisoft is trying to ape from its superiors are stumbling through infancy, and\nthe weight of the world Odyssey tries to present falters as a consequence.\n\n**Related:**[ **Forza Horizon 4\nReview**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/forza-horizon-4)\n\n![Assassin's Creed\nOdyssey](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nOutside of the flawed yet lofty ambitions Ubisoft clearly has for the series,\nOdyssey still excels in what matters: making you feel like a strong,\nunstoppable assassin. The Hidden Blade is nowhere to be seen, replaced by the\ntip of Leonidas’ Spear, but stealth still acts as a meaningful part of moment-\nto-moment gameplay.\n\nUnless a mission demands it, the majority of encounters can be tackled from\nthe shadows. There’s only a few major targets you’ll assassinate throughout\nthe campaign, often built up to with a series of epic missions as you either\ninfiltrate their inner circle or engage them in a full-frontal assault.\nInstead, you’ll be hunting The Cult of Kosmos by uncovering clues hidden\nacross Ancient Greece.\n\nTracking down targets by digging up a series of dynamically placed clues is an\nengaging idea, and the rewards for doing so kept me invested when I should\nhave been tending to more important matters. Obtaining artifacts from defeated\ncult members allows you to upgrade your spear in ruins spread across the map,\nmany of which harken back to an Ancient Civilization that ties into Odyssey’s\nbrief excursions in the modern day.\n\n**Related:**[ **Super Smash Bros\nUltimate**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/smash-bros-ultimate-release-\ndate-news-gameplay-2949964)\n\n![Assassin's Creed\nOdyssey](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAssassin’s Creed has gained an infamous reputation with past instalments by\nfilling the map with an incomprehensible mess of icons. Side content became\nnothing more than pointless chores for shinier pieces of armour and extra\npoints for upgrades. Odyssey supersedes this with Explorer Mode, described by\nUbisoft as “the way it’s meant to be played.”\n\nIt removes waypoints from the map, no longer showing you the quest objective\noutright. Instead, you’re provided three clues that will inevitably lead to\nwhere you need to go. It’s a clever innovation, forcing the player to analyse\nthe map in detail to find specific locations. It turns every quest into a\nstandalone adventure, although I wish the user interface was more intuitive as\nswitching to the map every ten seconds is a chore. It’s not without flaws, but\nExplorer Mode is a positive stepping stone for the future.\n\nIt’s also helped that many quests, aside from generic daily contracts,\nencompass characters with their own stories and motivations to share. At times\nI felt invested, curious to see how they’d conclude. That is, whenever the\nperformances didn’t border on absurd hamminess.\n\n## Verdict\n\nAssassin’s Creed Odyssey is another accomplished entry in the long-running\nopen world series. By expanding upon the blueprint established by Origins,\nUbisoft has crafted an experience that feels brave, huge and utterly\ngargantuan.\n\nSeeing everything it has to offer could take hundreds of hours, even if much\nof its side content feels superfluous, offering little more than small\ndroplets of experience and equipment you’ll never use.\n\nThat said, the foundations being built paint an exciting future for Assassin’s\nCreed, even if its dialogue system and romantic pursuits falter more often\nthan they succeed. Those hungry for more of Assassin’s Creed needn’t go wrong\nhere, as Odyssey presents an exhilarating depiction of Ancient Greece to\nexplore.\n\n## Score\n\n  \n\n"}
