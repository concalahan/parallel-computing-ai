Blackout is essentially\n[PUBG](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/playerunknowns-battlegrounds),\nbut with the polish you’d expect from a triple-A title. It’s had a great\nstart, consistently being one of the top streamed games on Twitch and selling\nrecord breaking units for Activision, but what about the mode itself? Here’s\nour top six tips for Blackout, to help you earn that all important victory.\n\n## Gain speed when skydiving\n\nFlying and landing is much different in Blackout compared to other battle\nroyale games like Fortnite and PUBG. You’re equipped with a wingsuit, so you\ncan gain some serious speed in the air. You’re even given an altitude metre so\nyou know exactly when your parachute will deploy, depending on the level of\nthe terrain you’re flying over.\n\nHow does it work? Basically, the more vertical you’re flying, the faster\nyou’ll be. Aim directly down when you jump out of the helicopters for a few\nseconds and you’ll pick up the pace. Level yourself out then aim for your\nchosen destination and you’ll reach it in no time at all.\n\n## Don’t land close to the helicopter path\n\nIn every battle royale game, the locations at the start of the flight are\nalways going to be the most popular. We’ve found that’s even more likely in\nBlackout though. At least half of the lobby tend to leap out and plummet to\nthe ground at breakneck speeds, as soon as the button prompt to jump appears.\n\nInstead, just give it a few seconds. Aim for somewhere on the outskirts of the\nmap, not too close to the helicopter, and you’ll be rewarded with far less\nplayers to deal with when you get there.\n\nJumping out straight away means most of the time, you won’t even find a gun\nand it’ll become incredibly frustrating when you keep dying right away because\nthere the only weapon nearby is in the hands of the enemy that put you down.\n\n**Related:[Blood of the Dead – Tips and\nTricks](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/black-ops-4-zombies-blood-of-the-\ndead-tips-and-tricks-guide-3605867)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![ps1](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n###  PlayStation Classic: Sony releases complete list of 20 games on the\nconsole\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/playstation-classic-mini-release-date-\npreorder-3583798 \"PlayStation Classic: Sony releases complete list of 20 games\non the console\")\n\n  * [ ![Hive View Outdoor](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Hive View Outdoor security camera can catch burglars before they strike\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/hive-view-outdoor-security-\ncamera-3612152 \"Hive View Outdoor security camera can catch burglars before\nthey strike\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Apple Black Friday](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Best MacBook 2018: All the facts on Apple’s MacBook, Pro and Air lines\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-macbook-3527944 \"Best MacBook 2018:\nAll the facts on Apple’s MacBook, Pro and Air lines\")\n\n  * \n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Choose your engagements carefully\n\nIn [Fortnite](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/fortnite-season-6-news-\nupdate-skins-weapons-battle-pass-challenges-3505854), you can fight anyone\nthen take shields right after and be right as rain. In Blackout, you’ve only\ngot the one armour. If you have a close fight where you have to heal up right\nafter, chances are you’ve taken a lot of bullets to the chest and your armour\nwill be completely destroyed. You won’t find any on your victim either because\ntheir armour will have been shredded in the process.\n\nMake sure you’re playing smart and choosing who you fight. If someone hasn’t\nseen you yet, don’t start wildly spraying at them. Follow them, get as close\nbehind them as you can, then drop them before they can react. That way, you\nkeep your armour fully intact.\n\n## Always aim for the head\n\nIt ties into the last tip but make sure you’re always trying to get a\nheadshot. Level three armour is the only one that contains a helmet, so if\nyour opponent doesn’t have that, shooting them in the head won’t damage their\narmour at all.\n\nThat means that you can then swap your damaged armour out for theirs at the\nend of the fight. A level one armour plate is far more useful than an almost\ndestroyed level two. Plus, headshots do more damage in general so you’ll kill\nthem quicker. Which – believe it or not – is very helpful when the bullets\nstart flying.\n\n## Don’t bother with useless consumable perks\n\nPerks in Blackout are found all over the floor as consumables that expire on a\ntimer when you use them. There’s some really great ones there, such as Dead\nSilence which muffles your footsteps and allows you to sneak up on one of your\nadversaries much easier. Skulker is another; you’ll move much quicker when\ncrouching, almost at the same speed as if you were sprinting.\n\nThere’s also some naff ones like Brawler and Iron Lungs. You can only carry 10\nitems at any one time with a backpack, so just don’t bother with either of\nthem at the start of a game. Brawler increases your melee damage, which will\nvery rarely come in handy on such a large map. While Iron Lungs allows you to\nhold your breath with a sniper for longer. Sack them off and save room for\nmore useful items.\n\n**Related:[Best Gaming Headset](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\ngaming-headsets-3431813)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n##  Use a Trauma Kit to go from 150 to 200 health\n\nTrauma Kits are the best healing item in the game. No matter what health\nyou’re at, they’ll instantly shoot you up to 200 – 50 more than the usual cap\nof 150. They’re great to use right after a fight, but consider using them as\nyou find them.\n\nIf you’ve got a healthy stack of Med Kits or Bandages, just pop a Trauma Kit\nright as you find one. That extra 50 health will come in handy as soon as you\ndo get in a fight, especially if you find more Trauma Kits along the way.\n\n## Vehicles are seriously loud\n\nBlackout’s map isn’t small by any stretch of the imagination. If you land at\nTurbine and the safe zone is all the way up by Construction Site, you’ve got a\nhell of a trek on your hands. There’s vehicles dotted about the place, such as\nquad bikes and helicopters but they are really, really, REALLY loud.\n\nAs soon as you start covering ground in a vehicle, anyone in the vicinity will\nbe alerted to your position. Whether you’re in a ground vehicle, an airborne\nhelicopter or a speedboat, people will latch on to you the second you hit the\nthrottle. There’s not much protection on any of the vehicles so we’d recommend\nonly using them to cover short distances. Dart from one cluster of houses to\nthe next then travel as much as you can on foot. And if someone targets you\nwith a Hellion Salvo, be ready to bail at a moment’s notice.\n\n**Have you managed to snag a victory in Blackout yet?
