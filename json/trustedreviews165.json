Aside from a barren website, there is\nscant other information about SixtyEight – lending more credence to its use as\na front.”\n\n“It wouldn’t be a stretch to surmise that SixtyEight could play a role in\nallowing Apple to purchase and import automotive equipment and tools without\ndrawing any suspicion.”\n\nThe report also details how employees approach the site with Apple badges\nscrubbed of the official Apple branding.\n\nWhat’s more, certain buildings on the site have been giving permits for\nautomotive work and repair areas.\n\nUnfortunately, there’s no way of telling for sure what Apple is cooking up at\nthe Sunnyvale campus, and it declined to comment on the story.\n\n"}
