That includes any future games\nfor the Halo, Gears of War and Forza franchises.\n\nHowever, third-party developers and publishers are not included in this Game\nPass update, though if Microsoft’s claims that there are plenty of people\ngetting excited about Game Pass, then we can expect to see some publishers\nmake their latest games available on the streaming service.\n\nCurrently, Xbox Game Pass offers subscribers access to more than 100 Xbox One\nand Xbox 360 games for £7.99 per month.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nWith more first-party games slated for the Game Pass, we can expect the game\nstreaming service to become more popular and appealing to people who have yet\nto commit to the monthly subscription.\n\nThe service is unsurprisingly limited to the Xbox One and [Xbox One\nX](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/xbox-one-x), despite Microsoft’s\nplans to allow Xbox gaming to be done on Windows 10 machines, though that\ncould change over time as Microsoft builds out Game Pass.\n\n**Related:[Samsung Galaxy S9\nrelease](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s9-release-date-\nspecs-features-price-uk-3266552)**\n\n**Are you a user of Xbox Game Pass?
