That means it’ssolid, but doesn’t reach the dizzying heights of newer Ultrabooks, such as thenew [Dell XPS 13](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/dell-xps-13) with itsmammoth 20-hour quoted battery life. Of course, prices for that awesome laptopstart at £1249.The iPad 2018 offers around 11 hours of screen time at 50% brightness, whichis more than enough for all but the busiest of days. An hour of 3D gamingtakes it down by 9%, while an hour of Netflix streaming over Wi-Fi cuts it by7%. Browsing the web consumes about the same amount of power as streaming.Playing a video on repeat until the battery died gave me just shy of 11 hours,which is identical to last year’s model. If you use the iPad for only a fewhours a day, you’ll get through a whole week before needing to charge it.The iPad is brilliant on standby, losing only 1-2% per day, but charging stilltakes a long time. Using the power adapter in the box gives you 25% after anhour; it takes four hours to fully charge the device.## **Why buy the iPad 2018?**There are two main reasons to buy the new 9.7-inch iPad. The first is becauseyou already have an iPad that you love, but it’s old and tired. If that’s thecase then you won’t be disappointed by this reinvigorated model.The second reason is because you’re considering buying a cheap laptop and youthink the iPad might be a better fit.If you need oodles of physical connectivity such as SD card readers, HDMIoutputs and USB ports, the iPad won’t work for you. If, however, you want aslick device that’s as comfortable streaming movies as it is editing photosand videos, as well as being a budget graphics tablet, then it’s a great bet.Don’t forget, however: you’ll need a keyboard case and the Apple Pencil tomake the most of it. I’d budget an extra £150 for both.This new iPad also makes more sense than the iPad mini 4, unless you’re deadset on a small tablet. It’s a lot more powerful and has a bigger screen, butonly costs an extra £10/$30 for the matching 128GB model.**Read next:[Best laptops](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-laptops-3431966)**## **Verdict**The new iPad is an iPad Pro on a budget. You get many of the same features fora fraction of the price, and that makes it hugely compelling.## Score"}
