That’s because it\ntakes around a month to delete a Snapchat account, and you can resurrect it at\nany moment within 30 days of hitting Delete simply by logging in.\n\nAs the company explains: “While your account is deactivated, your friends will\nnot be able to contact or interact with you on Snapchat.” However, once that\naforementioned 30-day period’s over, your Snapchat account will be gone\nforever.\n\nWe also recommend downloading your data before cutting ties with Snapchat.\nThis data includes your login history, account information, Snap history,\nprofile data, an overview of your friends, location and search history. You\ncan find a full breakdown of the data [here](https://support.snapchat.com/en-\nGB/article/download-my-data).\n\nHere’s how to download your Snapchat data:\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n  * Visit Snapchat’s Accounts website and enter your login details\n  * Click ‘My Data’ and ‘Submit Request’\n  * Snapchat will email you a link once your data’s ready to be downloaded − when the link arrives, follow it\n\nUnfortunately, once you’ve requested your data, Snapchat says you need to wait\nfor it to reach your inbox before deleting your account.
