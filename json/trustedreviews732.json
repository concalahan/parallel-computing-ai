However, rather than combining a screen on one\nhalf with a T9 keyboard on the other, the new design features a modern\ntouchscreen on both halves, which can fold in the middle to fit the phone in\nyour pocket.\n\nMotorola isn’t the only smartphone manufacturer to be eyeing up a phone with a\nfolding display (see [Samsung’s Galaxy\nX](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-x-foldable-phone-\nrelease-date-news-specs-price-2951423) for its most high-profile competitor),\nbut its combination of the bleeding edge technology with a retro-inspired\ndesign has piqued our interest.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nImage Credit: Mobielkopen\n\nThe usual disclaimers about patents such as this apply of course. The patent\ndoesn’t actually refer to this phone as the Razr by name, and nor is there any\nguarantee that this design will actually see the light of day.\n\nAlthough we’d love to see the Razr brand make a return, we’re not sure if\nwe’re entirely sold on this particular form factor. A folding screen makes\nmuch more sense conceptually if it folds lengthways to offer a tablet-style\nexperience, while this patent shows an unfolded display with a super wide\naspect ratio that doesn’t seem very useful. Maybe if you’re reading very long\narticles? We’re not convinced.\n\n**Related:[Best cheap mobile phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\ncheap-mobile-phones-3430364)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n## Don’t forget about Razr\n\nMotorola’s phone devision hasn’t been an independent company since it was sold\nto Google way back in 2012. Since then it’s been sold on to Lenovo, which has\nused the brand to release a stunning lineup of budget smartphones under the\nMoto branding (most recently the [Moto\nG6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/moto-g6)).\n\nBut the legacy of the Razr has always been keenly felt by the company. Back in\n2016 it released a trailer featuring the iconic clamshell phone, but it\nappears that nothing came from the firm’s promise to “Flip back to the Razr\ndays of yesteryear and get ready for the future.”\n\nWe’d love to see the Razr make an official branded comeback, and if Lenovo can\nget a folding screen integrated then we’ll have a reason to take a serious\nlook at it beyond nostalgia.\n\n**Would you like to see the Razr make a comeback?
