Shin told\nthe [Wall Street Journal](http://www.wsj.com/articles/samsung-isnt-planning-\nblackberry-acquisition-co-ceo-says-1421665607) he is only interested in\ndeveloping the existing partnership with the firm, rather than acquiring it.\n\n“We want to work with BlackBerry and develop this partnership, not acquire the\ncompany,” he said (via [Android\nCentral](http://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-may-extend-its-current-\npartnership-blackberry-wont-buy-it)).\n\nAfter the Reuters report (which the agency continues to stand behind) emerged\nlast week, many speculated Samsung may be chasing BlackBerry’s wealth of\npatents in order to boost its own mobile line-up.\n\nHowever, Shin told the WSJ, that Samsung already has 110,000 patents and was\nnot looking to grab BlackBerry’s 44,000.\n\n**Read more:[Samsung Galaxy A7 vs Samsung Galaxy\nS5](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/samsung-galaxy-a7-vs-samsung-\ngalaxy-s5-how-does-the-new-mid-range-champ-fare)**  \n  \nSamsung and BlackBerry’s partnership dates back to November last year, when\ntwo firms announced a deal to provide end-to-end security support for\nenterprise users.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThe Korean company said it would be [using BlackBerry’s security expertise to\nboost its own KNOX platform](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/blackberry-\nto-lend-its-security-expertise-to-samsung-s-android-phones) in order to add\nenhanced levels of security for users on the firm’s Galaxy-branded handsets\nand tablets.\n\nWhat the extension of that partnership may entail remains to be seen, but\ntoday’s developments certainly seem to confirm BlackBerry won’t be ending up a\nSamsung-owned company any time soon.\n\n"}
