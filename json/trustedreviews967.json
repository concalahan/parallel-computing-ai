And that’s not all, with the Royal Edition coming to PS4,\nXbox One and PC in just a couple weeks time.\n\nAlthough Final Fantasy 15’s popularity shows no signs of slowing, we can’t\nhelp but think about what Final Fantasy 16 could bring to the table. On that\nnote, _Trusted Reviews_ compiled everything we know and would love to see from\nthe mysterious RPG.\n\n**Related:**[ **Best RPG Games**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nrpg-games)\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## What is Final Fantasy 16?\n\nSquare Enix is yet to confirm the existence of Final Fantasy 16, including\nwhether or not the project has entered any form of production at the studio.\n\nAs with all titles in the series, it will likely introduce a brand new world\nfilled with compelling characters and locations that players will be eager to\nexplore.\n\n## Final Fantasy 16 release date – when is it coming out?\n\nA release date for Final Fantasy 16 is, to be blunt, an absolute pipedream at\nthis stage.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nSquare Enix confirmed during Tokyo Games Show 2017 that development on Final\nFantasy 15 will carry into 2018 with the PC release and further content\nupdates to come throughout this year.\n\n## Final Fantasy 16 wishlist – what we’d love to see\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**A greater variety of characters**\n\nFinal Fantasy 15’s quartet of charismatic boys proved hugely entertaining,\ncarrying us through a sprawling adventure with their likeable personalities.\nUnfortunately, beyond the core cast, characters were incredibly lacking,\nespecially compared to earlier games in the series.\n\nWe’d like to see Final Fantasy 16 massively expand upon its main cast of\nheroes, and perhaps ensure its repertoire of non-male characters expand beyond\nhelpless sidekicks and obvious sex appeal. Past games in the series, such as\nVII, IX and XII have proven that an ensemble cast can be brilliantly\nentertaining when executed well.\n\n**A bigger, more ambitious setting**\n\nThe world of Final Fantasy 15 felt like it was cut apart during development,\nproviding us with only a single sprawling play area before funneling the\nplayer into a series of linear missions ahead of the endgame. It was jarring,\nfailing to tell a fully cohesive story or depict a world that truly felt\nalive. We want to see this improved in 16.\n\nPlayers digging into the code of Final Fantasy 15 discovered areas [never\nmeant to be explored](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dms58hFsz74) in the\nfinished product, which could have remained incomplete due to time constraints\nat Square Enix. If Final Fantasy 16 manages to fulfill this sort of ambitious\nvision, it could be one of the best in the series for years.\n\nA tech demo from 2012 depicts a middle-eastern setting mixed with a\nfantastical array of magical elements, it’s a world we wouldn’t mind exploring\nin FF16:\n\n**Related:**[ **Dragon Quest 11**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/dragon-\nquest-11-release-date-news-gameplay-characters-story-switch-ps4-3234483)\n\n**Refined combat system**\n\nFinal Fantasy has been transitioning from its turn-based roots for years now,\nopting for a real-time battle system that favours fast, dynamic combat over\nthe archaic sequence of menus and time gauges. While we still have a soft spot\nfor the older ways, it’s unlikely we’ll see a return to that formula anytime\nsoon.\n\nChances are we’ll see Square Enix pursue the combat system first introduced\nwith Final Fantasy 15 alongside further refinements and mechanical\nintroductions. While fun, combat was relatively scrappy and lacking in a\nmeaningful sense of depth. Much of the entertainment came from the party’s\nfrequent banter and the sheer scale of some enemies.\n\nWe’d love to see this existing method of combat improved with more skills,\ncharacters, and methods of customisation that will provide an incentive to\ngrind sidequests away from the main narrative. The dodgy camera could\ncertainly be tweaked as well since we got a little tired of finding ourselves\ninside trees and bushes throughout Final Fantasy 15.\n\n**Related:[Final Fantasy 15 Windows Edition\nPreview](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/final-fantasy-15-pc)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**More enemy types**\n\nFinal Fantasy 15 had all the hallmarks we’ve come to expect from the series.\nChocobos, Cactuars, Marlboros and more were present and accounted for.\nUnfortunately, many of the adversaries your party faced were little more than\ngeneric robot soldiers who felt like useless cannon fodder.\n\nMany of the standout fights were found in hunts, which required players to\nabandon the main story in favour of side quests that, unfortunately, offered\nhardly anything in terms of worthwhile rewards. We’d love to see Final Fantasy\n15 expands its horizons in terms of both enemy and environmental design,\noffering something we really haven’t seen before.\n\n**What’s on your wishlist for Final Fantasy 16?
