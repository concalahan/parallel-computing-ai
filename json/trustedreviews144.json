The biggest of\nthese was [Fallout 76](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/fallout-76-release-\ndate-3479330), it’s upcoming online RPG set in the Fallout universe, and The\nElder Scrolls: Blades, an ambitious cross-platform game that will bring\ntogether platforms as diverse as PC virtual reality and mobile phones into a\nmultiplayer RPG experience.\n\nDoom will also be receiving a sequel called ‘[Doom\nEternal](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/doom-eternal-release-\ndate-3483704)‘ and we should expect to see more of the game at this year’s\nQuakeCon.\n\nThere were also a couple of smaller announcements.

We’ve embedded a video below.\n\n## Bethesda E3 2018 Showcase liveblog – All the action as it happened\n\n**0231:** Bethesda’s showcase kicks off with an adorable clip compilation of\nits multiple studios, how they create games and the passion that drives their\ncreativity. What a lovely way to get things started.\n\n**0233:** Senior Vice President Pete Hines has taken to the stage with usual\nfun demeanour to introduce Bethesda’s fourth annual E3 showcase. He promises\ntonight will be full of surprises as we see new projects from Bethesda’s ten\nglobal studios.\n\n**0236:** Things are kicking off with a look at Avalanche Studio’s Rage 2, the\nsequel nobody in the world really expected. Andrew WK has taken the stage and\nhe “came to party.”\n\n**0238:** We weren’t expecting a full set, chances are the game will be shown\nafter all this rocking is over and done with. Now the game director for\nAvalanche Studios has come on stage to introduce Rage 2 and what we assume is\ngoing to be a gameplay demo.\n\n**0243:** Time for some Rage 2! Bethesda is providing us with a detailed look\nat the game’s combat, world and vehicular combat. Oh, and there’s a healthy\ndose of narrative mixed in there, too. As the name suggests, there’s plenty of\nrage to go around. This demo will be diving into the ‘Eden Spacewalk’ mission\nas Walker, our protagonist seeks to take down the Authority. Rage 2 will be\ncoming to PS4, Xbox One and PC in Spring 2019.\n\n**0250:** Elder Scrolls Legends is being overhauled with completely new\nvisuals on mobile and PC. It’s also coming to PS4, Xbox One and PC later this\nyear with existing progress being carried over to all platforms. Sounds pretty\nnifty.\n\n**0253:** Next up is an update on Elder Scrolls Online: Summerset, which now\nboasts over 11 million players across all available platforms. A Story DLC\ncalled Mirkmire is coming later this year as ESO takes a deeper dive into\nArgonian Lore.\n\n**0258:** DOOM 2 has been announced and the denizens of hell have made their\nway to Earth, so it’s time for a demonic ass-whopping. Known as DOOM Eternal,\nthe same development team behind the beloved reboot has returned for another\nblockbuster shooter. Doom Eternal will be debuted at Quakecon in August 2018,\nso we unfortunately won’t see anything more until then.\n\n**0304** : For this week only, Quake Champions is offering a trial of its\nfree-to-play version before its official launch. If you get in before the\ntrial ends, you’ll be free to play it for as long as you like.\n\n**0307:** Arkane Studios are rolling out a new update for Prey with three new\nmodes including Survival and New Game +, two of which have been hugely\nrequested by fans in recent months. In addition, a new expansion is also being\nworked on which will take players to The Moon. As expected, it’s filled with\ndeadly hazards. Known as Prey: Mooncrash, it almost seems like a rogue like of\nsorts, and it’s available right now!\n\n**0310:** A six player multiplayer mode is also coming to Prey in the form of\nTyphon Hunter. This six-player mode will see one player trying to hunt down\nfive others who are disguised as mimics throughout the environment. It sounds\nlike a creative twist on the game’s mechanics.\n\n**0312:** MachineGames’ are on stage to thank the fans for embracing\nWolfenstein 2: New Colossus, and are also here to hype up the upcoming\nNintendo Switch release. Wolfenstein: Young Blood is an upcoming co-operative\nexpansion which can be played solo or with a friend as you seek to murder\ncountless Nazis. While platforms weren’t confirmed, it’s planned to launch in\n2019.\n\n**0316:** Bethesda has announced that Prey’s Typhon Hunter will have VR\nsupport when it launches later this year. Wolfenstein will also be receiving a\nVR experience in the form of Wolfenstein: Cyberpilot, adding to a growing\ncatalogue of Bethesda games that support the technology.\n\n**0318:** Fallout 76 is set to close the show as the legendary Todd Howard has\ntaken the stage. But before that, we’ve got a surpisingly hilarious skit with\nSkyrim being playfully teased on Alexa, Etch-a-Sketch and even an ice cube\ndispenser.\n\n**0323:** Now onto the meat of things! Fallout 76 is four times the size of\nFallout 4 and takes place in the realms of West Virginia 20 years after the\nbombs fell. “In Fallout 76, our future begins” the narrator says as the\ntrailer concludes.\n\n**0327:** The demo begins in a similar fashion to Fallout 4 as you briefly\nexplore the confines of Vault 76 before stepping out into a wasteland. The\nworld of West Virginia features new technology not previously seen in Fallout\n4, so you’re in for a visual treat for sure. The main story of Fallout 76 will\nsend your through six unique regions with their own creatures, terrain and\nother crazy additions.\n\n**0329:** Fallout 76 is entirely online, as every player to leave Vault 76 is\na living, breathing person in front of a PC or console. Todd Howard has\nreassured the crowd that the entire experience can be played solo, although\nBethesda wanted to see how their formula would fit an online template.\n\n**0333:** You can explore the world of Fallout 76 alone of with friends as you\nembark on missions. Killing other players will reward you with loot and\nexperience. Being on the losing side has its punishment, although the\nimportant aspects of progression remain intact.\n\n**0335:** The crafting system in Fallout 4 has been enhanced so you can start\nbuilding anywhere across West Virginia. This means you can build a homestead\nalone or with friends before, after or during a quest. Or you can ignore the\nstory altogether, opting instead to hunt wild creatures and nearby players.\n\n**0337:** West Virginia is filled with nuclear missile sites that players are\nfree to secure and use for their own destruction or that of others. You’ll\nneed a nuclear code to activate this, and individual parts are normally held\nby others. Obtaining this requires a bit of teamwork or a lot of murder.\n\n**0340:** Fallout 76 will be receiving a beta ahead of its release alongside a\ncollector’s edition including a map of West Virginia, a quartet of figurines\nand finally, a life-sized Brotherhood of Steel helmet as part of the Fallout\n76: Power Armour Edition. Fallout 76 will launch on November 14, 2018 across\nPS4, Xbox One and PC.\n\n**0343:** Fallout Shelter is available now for PS4 and Nintendo Switch as a\nway of celebrating the game’s three year anniversary. Bethesda has announced\nThe Elder Scrolls: Blades for mobile. It’s a massive, first-person RPG with\nconsole quality visuals. Much like Skyrim, you have a range of weapons,\nabilities and spells to use on enemies and to solve puzzles.\n\n**0350:** Blades will be coming to iOS and Android in Winter 2018 for free.\nBethesda has said it wants to bring Blades to every platform under the sun,\nand that includes all grades of virtual reality.\n\n**0352:** Bethesda has announced Starfield. It’s a new, single player next\ngeneration RPG. The show closes with a very short teaser of The Elder Scrolls\nVI, which we also assume is intended for the next generation.\n\n**Related:**[ **Call of Duty Black Ops\n4**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-4-3373836)\n\n**What did you think of Bethesda at E3 2018?
