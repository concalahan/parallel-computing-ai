Here’s what you need to know\nabout wireless chargers and whether your smartphone is compatible.\n\n## How does wireless charging work?\n\nThe physical connection between a cable connected to a both a power supply and\nyour smartphone have traditionally recharged phones. However, while a wireless\ncharger still needs to be connected to the mains (in most cases), there’s no\nneed for a cable to be plugged into your phone.\n\n**Related:[Best wireless charging pad\n2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-wireless-charger-3505891)**\n\nWireless charging pads feature a coil driven by an alternating current. When a\ncompatible device is placed upon the pad, it generates a magnetic field that\nstimulates an electric current within a similar coil within the phone. This\nwill replenish the battery.\n\n### Do all new phones offer wireless charging?\n\nUnfortunately not. Wireless charging is still considered to be a highly\npremium feature, so it is most commonly offered on flagship smartphones. In\nSamsung’s case, a Galaxy S9 and Galaxy Note 9 will offer wireless charging,\nwhile its mid-range A6 does not. Until very recently, this has been an\nAndroid-centric feature and only in 2017 did Apple add wireless charging.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nConsider this feature like ‘options’ when you’re buying a car, the higher-end\nyour phone the more likely it is to support wireless charging.\n\nThere are some exceptions through; top phones from HTC and first two\ngenerations of Google Pixel phones did not offer wireless charging. OnePlus,\ndespite its flagship killing reputation, has decided to sacrifice wireless\ncharging in order to undercut the likes of Apple and Samsung on price.\n\n### Which current phones do support wireless charging?\n\nMany of the top Android devices offer support for wireless charging. Here are\nthe most popular:\n\nSamsung Galaxy Note 9, Note 8, Note 5  \nSamsung Galaxy S9, S9+, S8, S8+, S7, S7 edge, S7 Active  \nLG G7, LG G6 (U.S. versions)  \nLG V30, V35, V40  \nMoto Z series (with wireless charging Mod)  \nSony Xperia XZ2, XZ2 Premium  \nNokia 8 Sirocco  \nPixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL\n\n### Which iPhones offer wireless charging?\n\nWireless charging has been a long-requested feature for iPhone users and, it’s\ntrue, Apple was a little behind the curve on this one. The first iPhones to\noffer wireless charging were offered in 2017. The iPhone X, iPhone 8 and\niPhone 8 Plus, as well as the 2018 iPhone XS, XS Max and iPhone XR handsets\nare all compatible with the Qi wireless charging standard.\n\nThis means any charger adhering to that standard will enable you to add some\njuice to your smartphone without having to insert the Lightning cable.\n\nApple doesn’t have its own wireless charging accessory available yet, but it\n[recommends the following. ](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208078)Apple\nhas developed its own solution called AirPower, which will be available to\nrecharge an iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods earphones simultaneously, but it\nis yet to go on sale.\n\n**Related:[What is AirPower?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-\nairpower-wireless-charging-release-date-price-3402369)**![AirPower wireless\ncharging](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAirPower\n\n### Wireless charging standards\n\nAwkwardly, there’s more than one wireless charging standard out there. The\nmost popular wireless charging standard is Qi, which is backed by the Wireless\nPower Consortium.\n\nAll of the phones listed here support Qi (pronounced “chee”) That includes\nnewest iPhones, the top handsets from Samsung (S9/Note 9, all the way back to\nS7/Note 5) as well as the LG G7 and V40.\n\nAll of the biggest tech companies are part of the WPC, but there’s still a\nlingering competitor in the space. The rival PMA tech has stuck around, but\nthis particular format war looks to be coming to an end. Earlier this year,\nthe prominent accessory-maker Powermat joined the Wireless Power Consortium,\neffectively spelling the end for PMA.\n\n### Which wireless charger should you buy?\n\nThe good news here is that pretty much any Qi-enabled wireless charger will\nenable you to replenish your phone in this manner. However, you should still\nbe picky when it comes to selecting one. One thing in particular to consider\nis the speed as which the charger will supplement your battery life.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe latest iPhones for example support wireless charging at 7.5W, but some\ncharging pads will only work at 5W. Devices like the Anker PowerWave Pad can\ncharge Android phones at the max speed of 10W.\n\nCheck out our guide to the [best wireless\nchargers](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-wireless-charger-3505891)\nto help you out.\n\n### Why do wireless charging phones have a glass back?\n\nAlthough it is technically possible to wirelessly charge a device with a metal\nback, it isn’t the most efficient or safest way way to achieve this. Here’s\nhow Corning, the manufacturer of Gorilla Glass, describes how glass is the\nbetter material for wireless charging:\n\n“Metal hijacks charging power. With a glass back, the magnetic field transfers\npower from charging pad coil to smartphone coil with negligible loss.\n\n“However, power loss occurs with metal backs. The metal itself consumes part\nof the power from the charging pad, turning it into heat. As a result, there\nare transmission losses, and charging time is increased. Moreover, there is a\nreal risk that the heat could raise the temperature of the phone’s innards,\nnot a good thing to happen, since electronics likes to run cool.”\n\n**Has wireless charging changed the way you replenish your phone?
