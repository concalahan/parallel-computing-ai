Whether you’re a seasoned veteran or only recently got into\nBattle Royale, here at Trusted Reviews we’ve compiled a list of all the guns\ncurrently in the game, and which ones are worth your time.\n\nBefore we begin, we’ve got a few things to point out. Every gun can be used to\nkill anyone. Even the lesser used guns pack enough firepower to drop a team of\nmurder-hungry Wicks. So even though there are certain guns you won’t\nnecessarily need, it’s still worth taking the time to try them out.\nFurthermore, when we label something “Avoid,” that’s only if there are other\nguns available. If someone’s running at you with a shotgun and there’s only a\npistol knocking about, don’t ignore it just because we said so. Any gun is\nbetter than no gun.\n\nAlso, we’ve broken down each gun by colour rather than rarity, you know,\nseeing as you’ll see the colour of the weapon first. Below is a key for what\neach colour translates to just in case you’re curious.\n\n  * Common – Grey\n  * Uncommon – Green\n  * Rare – Blue\n  * Epic – Purple\n  * Legendary – Gold\n\n**Related:[Fortnite Weekly Challenges\nGuide](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/fortnite-weekly-challenges-guide-\nseason-5-3564952)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Assault Rifles**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nGood at medium to long-range.\n\nAlthough technically not a long-range weapon, assault rifles work well enough\nover long distances to get your picks on enemies. Just be careful of their low\naccuracy the further you are away from someone. And no matter what, short\ncontrolled bursts pay out more often than spray and pray.\n\n**Our Pick: Suppressed AR**\n\n**Name** | **Rarity** | **DPS** | **Damage** | **Rating**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nAssault Rifle | Grey | 165 | 30 | Pick Up  \nAssault Rifle | Green | 170.6 | 31 | Pick Up  \nAssault Rifle | Blue | 181.5 | 33 | Essential  \nBurst AR | Grey | 109.7 | 27 | Avoid  \nBurst AR | Green | 117.9 | 29 | Pick Up  \nBurst AR | Blue | 121.9 | 30 | Pick Up  \nBurst AR (FAMAS) | Purple | 130.1 | 32 | Pick Up  \nBurst AR (FAMAS) | Gold | 134.1 | 33 | Essential  \nAssault Rifle (SCAR) | Purple | 192.5 | 35 | Essential  \nAssault Rifle (SCAR) | Gold | 198 | 36 | Essential  \nScoped AR | Blue | 80.5 | 23 | Pick Up  \nScoped AR | Purple | 84 | 24 | Pick Up  \nThermal Scoped AR | Purple | 64.8 | 36 | Pick Up  \nThermal Scoped AR | Gold | 66.6 | 37 | Essential  \nSuppressed AR | Purple | 176 | 32 | Essential  \nSuppressed AR | Gold | 181.5 | 33 | Essential  \nLMG | Blue | 200 | 25 | Pick Up  \nLMG | Purple | 208 | 26 | Pick Up  \nMinigun | Purple | 216 | 18 | Pick Up  \nMinigun | Gold | 228 | 19 | Pick Up  \n  \n**Shotguns**\n\nExcellent at close-range.\n\nShotguns are the best way to quickly kill someone. That is, if they work. A\nheadshot at close range should kill anyone in one or two shots. The problem?\nThe damage varies depending on distance and the angle you fire at, resulting\nin shots you think should kill, but actually don’t land where you intended.\nThe best tactic at the moment is one shot from a shotgun, then switch to an\nSMG to finish off. Or, failing that, the double barrel does insane damage if\nyou get right up in people’s faces.\n\n**Our Pick: Double Barrel**\n\n**Name** | **Rarity** | **DPS** | **Damage** | **Rating**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nTactical Shotgun | Grey | 100.5 | 67 | Pick Up  \nTactical Shotgun | Green | 105 | 70 | Pick Up  \nTactical Shotgun | Blue | 111 | 74 | Pick Up  \nPump Shotgun | Green | 56 | 80 | Pick Up  \nPump Shotgun | Blue | 59.5 | 85 | Pick Up  \nHeavy Shotgun | Purple | 74 | 74 | Essential  \nHeavy Shotgun | Gold | 77 | 77 | Essential  \nDouble Barrel Shotgun | Purple | 271.3 | 147 | Essential  \nDouble Barrel Shotgun | Gold | 285 | 150 | Essential  \n  \n**Related:**[ **Best PS4\nGames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/ps4-games-3431751)\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Sniper Rifles**\n\nExcellent at Long-range.\n\nSniping doesn’t have to be difficult. It all comes down to just picking the\nright one for your playstyle. If you’re great at sniping, go bolt-action. If\nyou sometimes miss, go semi-auto. If you’re more of a gunner, go with the\nhunting rifle. Just treat it like a single-shot assault rifle and you’ll be\npulling off headshots every time.\n\n**Our Pick: Heavy Sniper**\n\n**Name** | **Rarity** | **DPS** | **Damage** | **Rating**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nHunting Rifle | Green | 68.8 | 86 | Essential  \nHunting Rifle | Blue | 72 | 90 | Pick Up  \nBolt-Action Sniper | Blue | 34.7 | 105 | Pick Up  \nBolt-Action Sniper | Purple | 36.3 | 110 | Pick Up  \nSemi-Auto Sniper | Green | 90 | 75 | Pick Up  \nSemi-Auto Sniper | Blue | 93.6 | 78 | Pick Up  \nHeavy Sniper | Purple | 49.5 | 150 | Pick Up  \nHeavy Sniper Rifle | Gold | 51.8 | 157 | Pick Up  \n  \n**Related:[Fallout 76](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/fallout-76-news-\nrelease-date-3479330)**\n\n**S** **ub Machine Guns**\n\nExcellent at mid to close-range.\n\nSMGs currently have the highest damage potential in the game. The P90 is\ncapable of out-damaging shotgun players at close range, making it arguably the\nstrongest weapon out there. While they’re useless at long-range, at mid to\nclose there’s no stopping them.\n\n**Our Pick: P90**\n\n**Name** | **Rarity** | **DPS** | **Damage** | **Rating**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nCompact SMG (P90) | Purple | 200 | 20 | Essential  \nCompact SMG (P90) | Gold | 210 | 21 | Essential  \nSMG | Grey | 204 | 17 | Pick Up  \nSMG | Green | 216 | 18 | Pick Up  \nSMG | Blue | 228 | 19 | Pick Up  \nSuppressed SMG | Green | 207 | 23 | Pick Up  \nSuppressed SMG | Blue | 216 | 24 | Pick Up  \n  \n**Pistols**\n\nGood at mid to close-range.\n\nPistols are often overlooked when it comes to weapon picks. If you’re\naccurate, and have a fast trigger finger, the standard pistol and suppressed\ncan be beasts. Likewise, the hand cannon can act as a portable sniper if you\ncan land hits. The dual pistols also recently received a buff, so if there’s\nno shotguns or SMGs about, they’re worth checking out. Pistols are also handy\nfor finishing off a downed player in a flash.\n\n**Our Pick: Dual Pistols**\n\n**Name** | **Rarity** | **DPS** | **Damage** | **Rating**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nPistol | Grey | 155.2 | 23 | Pick Up  \nPistol | Green | 162.5 | 24 | Avoid  \nDual Pistols | Blue | 162.36 | 41 | Pick Up  \nDual Pistols | Purple | 170.5 | 43 | Pick Up  \nSuppressed Pistol | Blue | 175.5 | 26 | Pick Up  \nSuppressed Pistol | Purple | 189 | 28 | Pick Up  \nHand Cannon | Purple | 60 | 75 | Pick Up  \nHand Cannon | Gold | 62.4 | 78 | Essential  \n  \n**Explosives**\n\nExcellent at Destroying Bases\n\nExplosive weapons pack a punch but are easy to avoid. The rocket launcher and\nguided launcher both work as tools of death, but trying to hit someone with a\ngrenade launcher isn’t easy, so keep that one purely for base-bombing.\n\n**Our Pick: Rocket Launcher**\n\n**Name** | **Rarity** | **DPS** | **Damage** | **Rating**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nGrenade Launcher | Blue | 100 | 100 | Pick Up  \nGrenade Launcher | Gold | 110 | 110 | Pick Up  \nRocket Launcher | Purple | 87 | 116 | Essential  \nRocket Launcher | Gold | 90.7 | 121 | Essential  \nGuided Missile | Purple | 55.5 | 74 | Pick Up  \nGuided Missile | Gold | 57.7 | 77 | Pick Up  \n  \nFor any other Fortnite-related questions you may have, be sure to head on over\nto our [Fortnite Season 5 Guide\nhub](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/fortnite-season-5-news-update-skins-\nweapons-battle-pass-challenges-3505854).\n\n**And as always, you can chat Fortnite with us on Facebook and Twitter\n@TrustedReviews.**\n\n"}
