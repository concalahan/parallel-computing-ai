This includes lots of helpful informationincluding how to spot a genuine deal by checking the historical prices.But what about deals you should avoid this Black Friday? There will be plentyof duds out there if you’re not careful. One big area of confusion can oftenarise around ‘grey imports’. On the surface, these can look like fantasticdeals. But what you need to be aware of is that these grey imports are oftenproducts imported from outside the EU, often from Hong Kong or China.This can be problematic for a number of reasons. First off, if actually beingshipped to you directly from halfway across the world, delivery time can bevery slow. Think weeks to even months. Then you have to factor in the chanceof having to pay customs duty when your item reaches the UK.Some grey importers will have these products located in the UK already, whichdoes avoid the above pitfall. However, as these products originate fromoutside the UK, they can often not be covered by a local warranty. That’s aproblem if you encounter any issues down the line and need manufacturersupport. In the long run, that saving might not look so great after all.There are also other problems you might not expect, like manuals not beinglocalised. You might also find yourself scrambling for a plug adaptor as itmight not be the three-prong plug you need for the UK, or missing out onaccessories you would normally get from an item bought here.We’re sure not to recommend any deals from grey importers for these reasons.* * *_We may earn a commission if you click a deal and buy an item.
