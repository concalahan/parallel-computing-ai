We delve into the particularities ofthese two leading TV technologies.**Televisions have never been better, or more exciting, than they are today.This is partly because manufacturers have gone into competitive hyperdrivewith new features such as [4K UltraHD]()QLED – Samsung shows it’s not afraid of bright rooms## OLED VS QLED – Which is better?Trying to simply pick OLED over QLED or vice versa is a fool’s errand. Thebottom line is that they both excel in different ways. And so they both suitdifferent types of viewing conditions and picture preferences.If you’re looking for a TV for a bright room, or something to give you themost consistent dynamism from HDR content, the top-end, direct-lit QLED TVsare the way to go. They’re brighter, deliver more ‘real-world’ colour volume,handle ambient light better and are immune to screen burn issues.For darker conditions, though – at least for the sort of AV fans who valueblack-level depth and dark detailing over brightness – LG’s OLED TVs are theway to go.
