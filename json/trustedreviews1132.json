Here’s what you need to do.**\n\nResearch quests are a relatively new feature in Pokémon Go that assign players\nspecific tasks in order to have a shot at catching rare or exclusive Pokémon.\n\nHowever, more recently a special research quest has started that will give\nplayers the chance to catch the illusive Mew.\n\nMew was a Pokémon that was infamous for being impossible to catch within the\noriginal Pokémon Red and Blue. Despite all the rumours from your friends about\nhow and where to catch Mew, the character wasn’t actually available in the\ngame, unless you used a special GameShark device to unlock it.\n\n## How to catch Mew\n\nMew’s research quest is made up of eight stages, each consisting of three\ntasks. Completing each task nets you some bonus XP, while completing a stage\nnets you a few items, including Pokéballs, incubators and stardust (used for\npowering up your Pokémon).\n\nTo get started on the quest, tap the pair of binoculars on the bottom right of\nyour screen. This will bring up a brief bit of dialogue with Professor Willow.\nAfterwards, clicking on this set of binoculars will show your current tasks,\nand will allow you to claim your rewards once you’ve completed them.\n\nHere’s what you’ll need to do in order to complete each stage.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n  * **Stage 1:** For this stage you’ll need to spin five Pokéstops, catch ten Pokémon and transfer (read: delete in exchange for candy), five Pokémon.\n  * **Stage 2:** Next up you’ll need to assign yourself a buddy Pokémon, and earn two candy for walking a certain distance with them. You’ll also need to hatch three eggs, which you can do by incubating them and walking a certain distance (we’d suggest incubating the eggs that will hatch after just 2km). Finally, perform ten great throws, which is where you’ll have to hit a Pokémon with a Pokéball while their circle is halfway full.\n  * **Stage 3:** Here you’ll need to earn enough XP for your trainer to reach level 15, battle in two raids, and battle in a gym twice.\n  * **Stage 4:** Here’s where it starts to get a little more complicated. You’ll need to earn the silver ‘Kanto’ medal (which requires discovering and registering 50 1st-generation Pokémon), evolve 20 Pokémon (done using Pokémon candies) and earn five candy while walking your buddy (in the same way as you did in **Stage 2** above).\n  * **Stage 5:** Now you’ll need to catch yourself a Ditto. This is harder than it sounds, as Ditto disguises itself as random low-level Pokémon in the wild. Unfortunately you’ll just have to catch lots of low-level Pokémon in the hope that one will emerge as a Ditto. You’ll also need to catch ten Ghost-type Pokémon, and perform 20 ‘great’ throws (as above).\n  * **Stage 6:** This stage is where it really turns into a bit of a grind. You’ll need to earn enough XP to reach level 25, catch enough Magikarp that you earn enough candy to evolve one of the annoying fish, and you’ll also need to perform ten raids.\n  * **Stage 7:** Getting tired yet? Here you’ll need to use a berry, and then catch, 50 Pokémon, catch 100 1st-gen Pokémon to earn the gold ‘Kanto’ medal, and finally perform an ‘excellent’ curve throw. To do this, spin the Pokéball before releasing it, and make sure it hits the Pokémon when their circle is as small as possible.\n  * **Stage 8:** That’s it! For this stage you’ll just have to catch Mew. Claim your rewards from completing the previous stage, and then click claim reward to be thrown into a battle with the legendary creature. Be sure to use your most powerful Pokéball and a couple of berries first to reduce the pain of having to catch such a powerful Pokémon.\n\n_**Have you managed to catch Mew?
