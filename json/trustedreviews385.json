This year, the headphones to get are the\nSony WH-1000XM2.\n\nLast year’s [Sony MDR-1000X](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sony-\nmdr-1000x) were a hard act to follow but Sony has managed to improve them with\nintelligent adaptive noise cancellation, which adjusts itself according to\nyour actions. There were also small refinements, such as improved control\nresponsiveness, which made these headphones better than the originals.\n\n**Related:[Best wireless\nheadphones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-wireless-headphones-\nbest-bluetooth-headphones)**\n\nThe noise cancelling headphone market is tougher than ever, but Sony has\nmanaged to hold off competition from the [Bose QuietComfort 35\nII](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/bose-quietcomfort-35-ii) and the\n[B&W PX](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/bowers-wilkins-px).\n\n**Buy Now:[ Sony WH-1000XM2 at Amazon from £329](http://amzn.to/2zGbbbk)**\n\nIn our review, we said: “The new 1000X get so many things right it’s hard to\nfault them. They sound great, the noise cancellation is effective, and most of\nthe features are genuinely useful. If you’re looking for an everyday pair of\nheadphones, these are hard to beat.”\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n**Follow the action on #TrustedReviewsAwards.**\n\n"}
