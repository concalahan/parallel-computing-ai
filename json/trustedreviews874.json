{"result": 0, "title": "Gears of War 5: All the latest news, trailers and announcements", "description": "Gears of War 5 is the next entry of Microsoft’s critically acclaimed third-\nperson shooter series, and it seems to be taking things in a surprising\ndirection. While you still spend plenty of time behind walls firing at bad\nguys, a greater focus on story means characters will finally have a chance to\nshine.\n\nThe reveal trailer from Microsoft’s E3 2018 press conference provided us with\na detailed glimpse at a narrative filled with drama, depth, and potential for\nsome brilliant locations to visit. For example, things look much larger in\nscale compared to Gears 4, which can only be a good thing.\n\n## Gears 5 release date – When is it coming out?\n\nGears of War 5 is due to launch exclusively for [Xbox\nOne](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/xbox-one-s) and [Windows\n10](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/windows-10) in 2019. No specific\nrelease date was announced but it will be a part of [Xbox Play\nAnywhere](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/xbox-play-anywhere-\ngames-2947173) and [Game Pass](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/xbox-game-\npass-2947834) upon its release.\n\n## Gears 5 Trailer – See the game in action\n\nMicrosoft’s official announcement of the game was accompanied by its debut\ntrailer, which you can watch in all its glory below:\n\n**Related:[Best Xbox One Deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/best-\nxbox-one-deals)**\n\n## Gears 5 Story – What’s going on?\n\n***Major spoilers for Gears 1-4 ahead***\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n###  Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nGears of War 4’s story hit the same beats as its predecessors. We had the gang\nof soldiers surviving in a harsh world, the return of the Locust and we ever\nsaw the death of a loved one in a very similar fashion to Dom’s wife.\n\nMuch of Gears 4 can be traced back to the original trilogy, and the setup for\nGears 5 was laid clear at the climax of 4 where Kait, heartbroken, clutches\nher grandmother’s necklace. We now know that the game will indeed follow her\nas she embarks upon a much more personal mission related to this mysterious\nkeepsake.\n\nWe also get the post-credit sequence of Oscar Diaz fighting his way free from\na Snatcher in Gears 4, proving that he’s alive, and will hopefully return in\nthe sequel.\n\n**Related:[Upcoming Xbox One\nGames](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/upcoming-xbox-one-games)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Gears 5 gameplay – What can we expect?\n\nBased on all previous Gears games, we can expect the same intense and\nincredibly violent third-person shooter action. However, as our wishlist will\naddress, we hope The Coalition is prepared to mix things up a little.\n\n## Gears 5 – What we’d like to see\n\n**Take more risks**\n\nGears of War 4 was good but felt very familiar to the Gears games we’ve\nalready seen. So much so, that in prolonged play sessions it could become\nrepetitive and ‘samey’.\n\n**Related:[Xbox One X vs PS4 Pro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/xbox-\none-x-vs-ps4-pro-2993235)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nWith The Coalition taking over developmental duties from Epic, we hoped that\nwe’d see an evolution of the formula and some brand new innovations to\ngameplay that would keep series veterans on their toes.\n\nAs this was the first Gears game from the team, not colouring outside the\nlines can be forgiven, but for the sequel we want to see the team really make\ntheir mark. Whether that comes in the form of new mechanics, locations,\ncharacter types of even controls, we don’t care, as long as it feels fresh.\n\n**Genuinely new weapons and enemy types**\n\nWhile we were greeted to new weapons and enemy types in Gears of War 4, you’d\nhave to squint to notice any difference between them and what we’ve been\nblasting and chainsawing for the past decade. Outside of the robots, many of\nthe enemies either looked or behaved like past foes. Once again, The Coalition\nneeds to do something new.\n\nWhile there were new weapons not all of them were very good, so the reliance\non the shotgun and Lancer remained on Gears 4. In 5 we’d like to see new\nweapons that feel genuinely useful and increased ammo pickups for the more\nexotic items.\n\n**Kill Marcus Fenix**\n\nThe Coalition teased the prospect of killing off Marcus in Gears 4, but didn’t\ndeliver. While cameo appearances are fun and entertaining, they feel too much\nlike a safety net and were a burden on the new trio from emerging and\ndeveloping.\n\nFor this new trilogy to fully flourish and JD, Kait and Del to become as\nmemorable as the likes of Cole Train. Unfortunately, in our mind, for this to\nhappen Marcus has to bite the bullet.\n\n**Related:[Best Xbox One Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-xbox-one-\ngames_round-up)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nHowever, Fenix Sr. should go down in the most spectacular fashion possible.\nWe’re talking the biggest explosion in the belly of largest beast. Die as the\nhero we never deserved, wearing the sweatiest doo-rag in the history of man.\n\n**Get rid of Horde in the campaign**\n\nThose Horde defence modes were overused in Gears 4’s campaign and ended up\nfeeling cheap. Get rid and introduce new gameplay ideas that keep us invested.\nAs soon as Marcus grabbed that Fabricator, we let out a sigh. More ideas need\nto be invested in the campaign, please.  \n**  \nMatchmaking for co-op campaign**\n\nPlaying the Gears campaign in co-op has been a staple of the series since its\ninception, but it didn’t work very well in Gears 4. Though the game had a\npublic mode, it didn’t let you start the game on your own and have other\nplayers jump in later. This, plus a tendency to ignore your difficulty and\nlevel choices made public campaign co-op a frustrating experience.\n\nHaving drop in/drop out co-op play would be a massive bonus for the next\nentry.\n\n_**What would you like to see from Gears 5?
