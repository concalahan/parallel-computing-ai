These include new 55-inch and 65-inch AF9 OLED\nTVs, set to launch in the autumn. With the [Sony AF8\nOLED](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sony-af8-oled-a8f) TVs still\npretty fresh in our minds, can the Sony AF9 really have enough new stuff to\ntempt us?**\n\n## Sony AF9 OLED vs Sony AF8 – Design\n\nThe most instantly obvious difference between the AF9 and AF8 are the two\nsets’ aesthetics. For starters, while the AF8s stand bolt upright, the Sony\nAF9s lean back slightly (like the [Sony A1\nOLED](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sony-a1-oled) TVs). Some will\nfind this elegant and lovely, others may find it a bit annoying. Though given\nthat the AF9s are arguably designed to be placed directly on the floor while\nthe AF8s are meant to be placed on furniture, I’d argue the slight tilt makes\nat least some practical sense.\n\nThe Sony AF9 TVs also resembles the older A1 models more than the AF8s. They\npresent viewers with nothing but the TV’s screen. An elegant effect it\nachieves by supporting the screen on a photo frame-style pull out rear leg,\nrather than a traditional stand.\n\nThis support leg (which can fold in to become a chunky wall mount) differs\nfrom that of the A1’s by being pretty much all covered in a felt finish. It\nconnects to two side-firing subwoofer speakers which should easily beat the\nA1’s single rear-firing sub.\n\n**Related:[Best TVs](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-tv-3440232)**\n\n![Sony\nAF9](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![OnePlus 6T head on](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n###  The OnePlus 6T might soon be available from Three\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/three-uk-oneplus-3613430 \"The OnePlus 6T\nmight soon be available from Three\")\n\n  * [ ![Google Home](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Google Home Black Friday Deals: What to expect and deals live now\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/google-home-black-friday-3333404\n\"Google Home Black Friday Deals: What to expect and deals live now\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Apple Watch 4](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Bricked Apple Watch?

Overall\npower output is pretty much double that of the AF8s at 98W, and the speaker\nconfiguration has shifted from 2.1 to 3.2.\n\nThe ‘.2’ bit of that number describes the two side-firing subwoofers in the\nrear leg support. The ‘3’ bit, though, is the most interesting. While the Sony\nAF9 joins the AF8 (and A1) OLEDs in cleverly using its screen to produce its\nsound, it crucially adds a third actuator to the previous models’ two.\n\nThis extra ‘screen exciter’ sits in the TV’s middle, to create a stronger\ncentre speaker effect. As well as helping the sound enjoy more power, the new\ncentral actuator should reduce a key issue we had with the AF8, where voices\ncould at times sound misplaced on the screen when you viewed it from an angle.\n\nThe Sony AF9’s audio differs from that of the AF8, too, by supporting a new\n‘Center Speaker’ mode. Activate this and all of the AF9’s built in speakers\nwork together as a centre channel speaker within an external surround sound\nspeaker system. This is a clever idea given that external centre speakers are\nnotoriously hard to position effectively.\n\nCentre channel sound in such a full speaker system arrangement is passed to\nthe TV via two screw/banana plug cable inputs, and the TV’s sound levels can\nbe adjusted via whatever amp you’re using to power your surround sound speaker\nsystem.\n\n![Sony\nAF9](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSony AF9/A9F\n\n## Sony AF9 OLED vs Sony AF8 – Picture\n\nThe Sony AF9 differs from the AF8 in a number of ways when it comes to picture\nquality.\n\nFor instance, it features a new Pixel Contrast Booster OLED panel driver. Sony\nclaims it’ll deliver more punchy but also more subtle colour toning,\nespecially in the brightest parts of HDR pictures. Confusingly Sony isn’t\nclaiming that this new feature actually increases the panel’s brightness or\ncolour volume. It should, though, deliver both higher average brightness\nlevels and more colour tone finesse – both of which would be important\nenhancements over the AF8.\n\nThe Sony AF9’s new X1 Ultimate processor is another big differentiation. It’s\nclaimed to be around twice as powerful as the already class-leading X1 Extreme\nprocessor found in the AF8. As such, it should do a much better job with key\nfeatures such as upscaling HD to 4K; converting standard dynamic range content\nto HDR; removing colour banding artefacts with HDR; and enhancing the sense of\nsharpness, depth and colour finesse of even native 4K HDR content.\n\nWhile Sony didn’t, sadly, do a specific X1 Extreme vs X1 Ultimate head to head\nat its recent launch event, there was enough evidence on show to suggest that\nit is a real step forward – especially when it comes to clarity, SDR to HDR\nconversion, shadow detail and the handling of tonal subtleties in the\nbrightest HDR picture areas.\n\n![Sony\nAF9](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSony AF9/A9F\n\nA key ambition of Sony’s new Master Series TVs is to deliver pictures that\nlook like their creators’ intended. With this in mind, the AF9’s images have\nbeen tuned to track as closely as possible to the pictures produced by the\nrenowned Sony X300 OLED professional mastering monitor.\n\nSony has gone the extra mile with regards to its new focus on accuracy by\nproviding the AF9 with a Netflix Calibrated Mode. This automatically adjusts\nyour AF9’s settings when you’re watching Netflix shows to best match the look\nthe creators were going for in the mastering process.\n\n![Sony\nAF9](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nNetflix Calibrated mode on the Sony AF9\n\nOn top of this, the AF9s even boast a full colour management system and\nvarious other calibration tools. This is the first time Sony has supported\nafter-sale calibration on any of its TVs (though the AF8 and AF9 both undergo\nin-factory calibrations before they’re released to retail).\n\nOne last potentially (hopefully) really significant change the AF9 delivers\nover the AF8 is Android Oreo. Sony only gave us the briefest glimpse of Oreo\nin action on the AF9 (it’s still something of a work in progress), but it\nseems set to deliver a far more engaging, friendly and slick operating system\nthan the tired old Android TV platforms Sony’s last few TV generations have\nstruggled with. And it doesn’t seem likely at this stage that Oreo can be\nadded to the AF8 via a firmware update.\n\nWe’ll bring you a full review of a Sony AF9 OLED just as soon as we can get\nhold of a production sample.\n\n_**Excited about Sony’s new TVs?
