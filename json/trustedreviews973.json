Countless hours spent praying for someone − anyone −** **to\nactually challenge Man City this time out. And when the games are over, it’s\ntime to find meaning in every single kick, over on Match of the Day with Gary\nLineker and the gang.**\n\nAs most people are aware, you can live stream Match of the Day on BBC iPlayer,\nand if you happen to miss the start of the show, [Live\nRestart](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/help/how-to-guides/getting-\nstarted/live_restart) lets you jump back to the beginning (you can rewind up\nto two hours).\n\n**Read more:[Best 4K TVs](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-4k-tvs)**\n\nBut anyone who’s − football gods forbid − ever managed to completely miss the\nweekly Premier League highlights show knows that it doesn’t just appear on-\ndemand on BBC iPlayer right after it finishes.\n\nAs the Beeb [explains](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/help/motd): “It’s due to\nthe rights agreement we have with the Premier League.”\n\nInstead, the Saturday edition of Match of the Day (usually fronted by Lineker)\ngoes up on iPlayer at midnight on the Sunday evening after it airs − to\nclarify, that’s the early hours of Monday morning.\n\n**Read more:[Eleven Sports](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/eleven-\nsports-3532011)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThe Mark Chapman-fronted Sunday edition of Match of the Day (MOTD2),\nmeanwhile, is added to BBC iPlayer at midnight on the Monday evening after it\nairs. That’s the early hours of Tuesday morning.\n\nIn winter, when the fixtures pile up, we tend to also get a flurry of special\nmidweek Match of the Day shows. These are subject to the same rules, and\nappear on-demand on iPlayer at midnight the day after they’re broadcast. So a\nWednesday episode would be made available on-demand in the early hours of\nFriday morning.\n\nWhat’s more, while the BBC tends to make programmes available on-demand for 30\ndays iPlayer, Match of the Day is one of a handful of exceptions.\n\n**Related:[Best VPN](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-vpn-3470328)**\n\n“Each episode will be available to stream or download until the next episode\nis broadcast, or for seven days after broadcast, whichever comes first,” the\nBBC explains, [adding](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/features/30-days): “This\nis generally due to legal or contractual reasons.”\n\nMatch of the Day episodes dealing with competitions other than the FA Premier\nLeague may have different availability, the BBC says.\n\n**Share your predictions for the 2018/19 season with us on Twitter\n@TrustedReviews.**\n\n"}
