Some wording led many to believe that all future releases wouldsupport the scheme, but TrustedReviews contacted Microsoft for clarity andreceived this comment:“When we unveiled Xbox Play Anywhere, we said that every new Microsoft Studiostitle shown at the Xbox E3 2016 Briefing will support Xbox Play Anywhere.“We understand that a recent blog post didn’t specify that the only MicrosoftStudios titles we’ve confirmed to date as Xbox Play Anywhere were shown at theE3 2016 Xbox briefing. We’ve updated the blog post and apologize for anyconfusion. You can go to www.xboxplayanywhere.com to see the current list ofparticipating games.”So while not all games will support the scheme, Microsoft has clarified thatonly the games shown at E3 2016 currently support Play Anywhere. However,there’s still plenty of potential for future releases to offer the service.## How do I use it?It’s simple and easy.
