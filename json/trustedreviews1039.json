It’s also got support for a 32-megapixel image sensor and Cat.7 LTE.\n\nThe Kirin 950, meanwhile, can handle a 2.4GHz maximum clock speed, boasts a\nMali T880 GPU, can handle a 42-megapixel image sensor, and supports Cat. 10\nLTE.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nBoth chips also feature the new i7 co-processor. This always-on co-processor\nis listed as providing computing heft for the sensor hub, connectivity, and\nsecurity. The latter could be an indication of a built-in, hardware-level kill\nswitch.\n\nThe Kirin 940 is tipped for a Q3 release, while the more powerful Kirin 950\nwill enter the market in handsets in Q4 this year.\n\n**Related:** [11 Best Android Phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-\nandroid-phones-1_round-up)\n\nThe interesting part about all of this is that the Kirin 950 might be destined\nto appear on Google’s next Nexus.\n\nIn recent weeks, we’ve seen a\n[flood](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/huawei-s-nexus-analyst-outs-\ngoogle-s-next-smartphone-maker) of\n[rumours](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/report-huawei-and-lg-to-build-\ntwo-google-nexus-devices-this-year) suggesting Huawei is going to be the\nmanufacturer for this year’s Nexus smartphone.\n\nWe also recently heard that the Google-powered handset would be eschewing\nQualcomm’s Snapdragon series for [Huawei’s own Kirin\nchips](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-s-next-nexus-to-use-huawei-\nchip-not-snapdragon).\n\nWhen you consider that the next Nexus smartphone, like its predecessors, will\nlikely launch in Q4, and that the Kirin 950 is also set to land in Q4, there’s\na seemingly obvious connection to be made.\n\nIf that’s all true, and that’s a big if at this stage, then the next Nexus\nsmartphone could be a seriously formidable bit of kit.\n\nIt would be a much-needed boon to the Nexus family too, as the Nexus 6 was met\nwith a lukewarm reception.\n\nUnfortunately, we can’t say for sure whether any of this is actually true\nuntil either Google or Huawei decides to out the Nexus for real.\n\nHuawei declined to comment on any rumours.\n\n"}
