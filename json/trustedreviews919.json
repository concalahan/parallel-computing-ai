We’re glad to say that the noise has been taken from an\nolder F1 car as opposed to the futuristic whistle of this year’s electric\nhybrid offering.\n\nSadly the Red Bull Racing Ultimate Ears Boom will not be available to any\naverage Joe, so put your wallet back in your pocket.\n\nUpping the device’s exclusivity factor, the RBR Boom will only be offered to\nthose fortunate enough to be invited to the Red Bull hospitality suite over an\nF1 weekend this season.\n\nFor those diehard fans keen on some F1-themed on-the-move audio then, we\nsuggest you keep an eye on collectable stores and online auction site just in\ncase the odd one pops up.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n**Read More:** [Beats Pill review](https://www.trustedreviews.com/beats-\npill_Portable-Audio_review)\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n"}
