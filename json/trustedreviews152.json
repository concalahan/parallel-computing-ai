Rival mobile network operator\nThree may think not.**\n\nThe EE 5G trial (or BTEE 5G trial, following the mega-merger between BT and\nEE) is set to take place in London’s Tech City – an umbrella term for the area\naround the Old Street roundabout – and will see 10 sites upgraded with the\nnext-gen network technology.\n\nFive small businesses and five homes have been selected as guinea pigs for\nEE’s 5G tech using prototype broadband devices, ahead of the network’s\npromised 5G consumer rollout in 2019.\n\n**Related:[Best SIM only deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/sim-only-\ndeals-uk-2943877)**\n\nPredictably, BTEE brass are excited by the real-world testing, with BT\nConsumer CEO Marc Allera saying that the live trial “is a big step forward in\nmaking the benefits of 5G a reality for our customers.”\n\nHowever, Three CEO Dave Dyson is taking a more circumspect view of UK 5G\nrollout, admitting that a finalised consumer 5G proposition is still very much\na “work in progress”.\n\n> “I’m not so keen to rush a trial just to say we were the first to trial 5G.\nFor us, it needs to be a meaningful trial so when handsets are available and\nrouters are available we’re in a position to push quite hard. We think that\nwill be the middle of 2019,” Dyson told _Trusted Reviews_ at a Three 5G\npreview event in London.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n###  Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nIt’s as thinly veiled as references come, though he added that expedited\nrollout of 5G could prove attractive to some – even if it there wasn’t much\nsubstance to it.\n\n> “People were prepared to pay a premium for something [4G] that wasn’t hugely\ndifferentiated. People intuitively think the next technology is better – they\nwant to show off a bit,” he said.\n\nDyson’s comments echo the sceptical stance of O2, in which it said that an EE\ndeployment of 5G before 2020 would represent little more than ‘5G Lite’.\n\n> “Any UK operator launching ‘5G’ before 2020 would be using a ‘lite version’\nof 5G,” O2 [told](https://5g.co.uk/news/o2-uk-5g-lite/4386/) 5G.co.uk.\n\n‘5G Lite’ is simply a turn of phrase, but the point being made by O2 here is\nclear: any UK network promising 5G capabilities in 2019 that represent a\nsignificant improvement over the current 4G state-of-play has its work cut out\nfor it.\n\nThis is largely because the 4G to 5G shift isn’t going to be as pronounced the\nleap from 3G to 4G. While moving to 4G enabled smartphone users to do a number\nof new things, like seamlessly stream video on-the-go, the jump to 5G will be\na more subtle one that improves less sexy things like wireless broadband and\nIoT-connected devices.\n\nIn fact, 5G is based on the same LTE frequency range as 4G, so while network\nspeeds will of course be enhanced with the new technology (2Gbps downlink\nrates are technically possible with 5G), it will be network capacity that gets\nthe biggest boost – something that’s less plain to see to the naked eye.\n\n**Related:[Best broadband\ndeals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/broadband-deals-uk-3344261)**\n\nWhatever the reality, expect the hype around 5G to reach nauseating levels\nnext year, as the first 5G-ready mobile devices are likely to be released in\nthe second-half of 2019.\n\n**When do you think we’ll start to see the real benefits of 5G?
