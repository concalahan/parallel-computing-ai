Thankfully, it’s a fantastic device that ticks\nnearly every box.\n\nSome thought the Note 8 might never happen. After the successful launch and\nsubsequent disastrous recall and discontinuation of the Note 7, which still\ngets namechecked on some airlines as a banned object, you’d have forgiven\nSamsung for dropping the Note name and starting again.\n\n**Related:[Samsung Galaxy Note 9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-\ngalaxy-note-9-release-date-3304594)**\n\nThe Note 8, then, is supposed to be Samsung’s humble return to the phablet\nmarket – plus a big rival to the [iPhone\nX](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-x) and [iPhone 8\nPlus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-8-plus) – and in many ways\nthis phone is a huge success. With a gorgeous design, incredible 6.3-inch\nscreen, great software and excellent stylus, there’s very little not to like\nhere.\n\nIn fact, the only big concern I have is that this phone’s battery life might\nnot be long enough for heavy users.\n\n## Samsung Galaxy Note 8 – Design\n\nThe Note 8 is a stunning piece of design. While the [Galaxy\nS9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9) and [Galaxy\nS9+](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9-plus) have a\nfriendly, more curvaceous design aesthetic, Samsung continues to nod at its\nbusiness customers with slightly sharper edges and a squarer camera module.\nYou still get the iconic InfinityEdge design where the left and right sides of\nthe screen slope off to the side, and you get the ultra-thin top and bottom\nbezel to boot. I actually prefer it to the regular S phones, although others\nmight disagree.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nThe whole lot is coated in Corning Gorilla Glass 5.0, and my unit lives up to\nits colour description of Midnight Black. It looks great out of the box, but\nafter a little while of using it, greasy marks do begin to build up on the\nback. That’s not unique to this phone, and it looks far cleaner than many\nsmartphones do after they’ve been subjected to my clammy palms.\n\n**Related:[Best phablets](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nphablets-2015)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIt’s hard for me to comment on the longevity of the glass coating on this\ndevice because I haven’t dropped it properly. However, experience from\nelsewhere tells me that even the latest glass phones won’t survive clumsiness:\nour mobiles editor, Max Parker, dropped the Galaxy S8 and cracked it, while my\nwife dropped her (Gorilla Glass 4) [Galaxy A5\n2017](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-a5) from table\nheight and smashed the back panel to smithereens. The Note 8 is at least\nIP68-certified, meaning it’s waterproof even when subjected to a half-hour\nsubmersion.\n\nI did drop the phone a couple of inches onto my kitchen counter at one point,\nand later laid it on a slightly rough stone table, and it came away without\nblemishes, as you’d well expect. The camera module has a very, very slight\nextruding border that protects the lenses from such behaviour. I did pick up\none tiny mark on one of the exposed antennae on the top of the phone, which\nseems to have happened when it was in my pocket.\n\nAs for features, let’s start with the front. There’s a front-facing camera and\niris scanner inside the top bezel along with the earpiece and an LED\nnotification light. On the bottom there’s nothing visible, although the lower\nportion of the screen is actually a pressure-sensitive home button that can be\nused to wake the phone. On the left edge you get the volume rocker and the\nBixby personal assistant button, while on the right is the power button. The\nlower edge is home to the USB-C connector, 3.5mm headphone socket and pop-out\nS Pen stylus, as well as the loudspeaker. Finally, on the top, you get a SIM\ncard/microSD card slot.\n\nThe camera module comprises of two sensors behind two lenses (more on these in\nthe Camera section), an optical heart-rate monitor, LED flash, and a\nfingerprint scanner. I’ll save the fingerprint scanner for later, but I’ll say\nright here that on a phone this size, this is most certainly the wrong place\nfor it and is almost impossible to reach when pulling the phone out of your\npocket.\n\nIts 6.3-inch screen might sound like a nightmare for the small-handed. In\nreality, thanks to the sloped edges, tiny top and bottom of the bezel, and\nslightly stretched 18.5:9 aspect ratio, it’s nowhere near as big as the\n5.5-inch [iPhone 8 Plus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-7-plus)\nand other similarly chunky phones.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: Max Parker / Trusted Reviews\n\nIt’s comfortable to _hold_ in one hand, but less so to operate it effectively.\nIf you’re just idly scrolling through Facebook then it’s fine, but as soon as\nyou want to tap a button in the top half of the screen you’ll need your other\nhand, or to activate one-handed mode. One-handed mode is off by default but\nwill be essential for many buyers and, once enabled, can be activated either\nby triple-tapping the home button or swiping diagonally up from the bottom\ncorners.\n\n## Samsung Galaxy Note 8 – Screen\n\nAt 2960 x 1440 pixels (‘WQHD+’, 522ppi), the 6.3-inch panel certainly isn’t\nleft wanting when it comes to resolution. Trouble is, you’ll rarely see that\nmany pixels being put to good use. In its default ‘optimised’ power state, the\nGalaxy Note 8 only renders apps and photos at 2220 x 1080 pixels (‘FHD+’,\n392ppi), and 1480 x 720 pixels (‘HD+’, 261ppi) when in power-saving mode. It’s\nonly when you switch on Performance mode, to the detriment of battery life,\nthat the Note 8 actually fires on all cylinders and pixels.\n\n**Related:[Best Android phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nandroid-phones-1)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nTo many users, this will be confusing. Why have so many pixels when you’re not\ngoing to be using them to their full effect? When in FHD+ mode, 2.3 million\ndots are being dealt with by 4.2 million physical pixels, which seems like a\nwaste. Indeed, only serving up FHD+ saves processing power, but doesn’t save\nany power from the screen itself.\n\nComplexity aside, even when in its standard mode, the screen is stonkingly\ngood. When it needs to, it can rise to an eye-searingly bright 1200 nits. For\nfor the uninitiated, a good laptop screen will get to about 300 nits and a\ntop-end HDR TV will generally get to around 1000 nits. That’s unbelievably\nbright, although it’s hard to verify because even with automatic brightness\nswitched off the screen refuses to go beyond 340 nits under normal conditions.\nI suspect you’ll only ever get to 1200 nits when watching HDR compatible\ncontent from YouTube and Netflix, both of which look fantastic.\n\n### Best Galaxy Note 8 Deals\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=6224&clickref=tr-\nnewmobiledeals-\nnote8&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fonehouse.co.uk%2Fshoppingcart.aspx%3Fhaffid%3D880557%26gid%3D0%26colid%3D999)\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=6224&clickref=tr-\nnewmobiledeals-\nnote8&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fonehouse.co.uk%2Fshoppingcart.aspx%3Fhaffid%3D880557%26gid%3D0%26colid%3D999)\n\n###\n\n[Samsung Galaxy Note 8 – 35GB, £43pm, no upfront on EE\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=6224&clickref=tr-\nnewmobiledeals-\nnote8&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fonehouse.co.uk%2Fshoppingcart.aspx%3Fhaffid%3D880557%26gid%3D0%26colid%3D999)\n\nA great deal with a generous 35GB of data and zero upfront cost.

There’s a slight blue tinge if you\nview the phone off-centre, and the two sloping edges lose some brightness and\nclarity, which is a bit disappointing, if not surprising.\n\nWith the screen turned up to its full WQHD+ resolution, text is super sharp\nand crisp, as are high-resolution photos. But, I’ll be honest, you’d be hard-\npressed to spot the difference in everyday use. I suppose this conclusion sort\nof justifies Samsung’s decision to disable the full resolution by default, but\nthat doesn’t change the fact that this super-expensive screen is being wasted\nmost of the time.\n\nBecause of the odd aspect ratio, you have to explicitly set each app you open\nto be stretched to the full length of the screen. So far I’ve had no problems\nwith this. The only other downside is that most online videos are in a 16:9\naspect ratio, which means your video will have black bars either side of it,\nor you can stretch and crop the video so it fills the screen. Some widescreen\nmovies actually benefit from the latter, but you’ll need to decide on a video-\nby-video basis.\n\nOne final function of note is the always-on screen. Because AMOLED pixels are\nself-lighting (they only consume power when they’re not black, unlike\nconventional LCDs that are always on), you have the option of keeping the\ndisplay on with a black and white clock, battery information and media\nbuttons.\n\nThis is great, until you check out Samsung’s power options and realise that\nhaving it on can decrease battery life by over an hour a day. What’s more, it\ndoesn’t seem to turn off even when the phone is in your pocket, wasting even\nmore precious energy. It’s a great feature on Samsung’s other phones, but when\nbattery capacity is so tight, it’s the first thing you should turn off.\n\n[ Next  \nSoftware and S Pen ](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-\nnote-8-software-s-pen)\n\n"}
