But this has\ndone little to put off Razer, with the company introducing Project Linda at\n[CES 2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ces-2018-live-news-\nhighlights-3350586).\n\nIn essence, this is a Razer laptop completely powered by the firm’s\nsurprisingly good debut smartphone. You slip the phone into a slot where you’d\nnormally find a trackpad, a retractable USB-C port locks it in place and\nvoila, you can now view all your content and play games on the Quad HD\n13.3-inch display.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nUnlike other attempts at the ‘lapdock’, Project Linda utilises the phone as a\ntrackpad. This makes a lot of sense, not only as a way of navigating the UI,\nbut also as a secondary screen for displaying, say, parts of a game or editing\ntools in a photo app.\n\nProject Linda, which is simply a prototype at this stage, has one USB-A port\non the side for peripherals and another USB-C port for charging. There’s also\na headphone jack, which was lacking on the [Razer\nPhone](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/razer-phone), along with an\nextra 200GB of internal storage. There are no speakers, but that shouldn’t be\nan issue since the audio produced by the phone is among the best out there.\n\nThe keyboard features the brand’s iconic Razer Chrome tech for colour\ncustomisation and it has some specific Android keys for accessing Google\nAssistant and the App tray.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nWhether we’ll ever see this as an actual product that you can buy remains to\nseen – Razer is known for using CES for showcasing concept products that never\nmake it onto shelves – but it certainly seems like one of the most well-\nrounded ‘lapdocks’ I’ve seen so far.\n\n**Would you like to see this concept become a reality?
