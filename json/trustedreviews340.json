Naturally, there’s support for all of the\nusual music-streaming services.\n\nPolk says its system is the “new heart of the home theatre”, with HDMI and USB\nslots designed to house and power the Fire TV stick and the Fire TV boxes,\nincluding the 4K version.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n![Polk](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe company has thought this through pretty well and the soundbar’s remote\ncontrol even features an Alexa action button that will briefly lower the\nvolume so you don’t have to yell to make your command heard.\n\nIt’s Bluetooth and Wi-Fi-enabled, and even supports Dolby Vision and HDR10\nwhen paired with supported devices.\n\nIn terms of the audio tech, there are two 1.25 x 3.25-inch full-range drivers,\ntwo 1-inch tweeters and a wireless 6.5-inch subwoofer.\n\nGiven the number of Echo devices Amazon has released in the past 12 months,\nwe’re surprised this hasn’t been covered yet. Regardless, the Polk Command Bar\npromises to be a popular solution.\n\n**Are there any untapped gadgets you think would benefit from Alexa\nintegration?
