We’ve also put together\na wishlist of things we’d love to see in the sequel.\n\n## Bayonetta 3 – What is it?\n\nActing as the third entry in Platinum Games’ beloved character-action series,\nBayonetta 3 will once again see the return of our titular character as she no\ndoubt plans to punish a bunch of naughty angels and demons.\n\nPlatinum Games is yet to confirm when Bayonetta 3 will take place or if it’ll\nact as a direct sequel to the second instalment, but we’re excited\nnonetheless.\n\n**Related:[Best Nintendo Switch\nGames](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/nintendo-switch-games-3435122)**\n\n![bayonetta\n3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\n## Bayonetta 3 release date – When is it coming out?\n\nRevealed at The Game Awards 2017, Bayonetta 3 is yet to receive any kind of\nrelease window from Nintendo nor Platinum Games.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n## Bayonetta 3 gameplay – What can we expect?\n\nThe past two games were renowned for their over-the-top action and spectacular\nstyle. Levels saw Bayonetta fighting towering behemoths across different\ndimensions with an assortment of ridiculous weapons. Skills could be upgraded\nas you progressed in a similar manner to [Devil May\nCry](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/devil-may-cry-5-dmc-release-date-\ntrailers-gameplay-news-ps4-3334071), a series Bayonetta draws much of its\ninspiration from.\n\nIt’s unclear how similar Bayonetta 3 will be in terms of setting and\nmechanics, but our money is on Platinum Games expanding upon its existing\nformula with an even crazier combination of levels, enemies and combat.\n\n## Bayonetta 3 trailers – How does it look?\n\nOnly one trailer has been shown of Bayonetta 3 thus far, and it’s incredibly\nbrief. Check it out below:\n\n**Related:** **[Upcoming Nintendo Switch\nGames](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/upcoming-nintendo-switch-\ngames-2018)**\n\n## Bayonetta 3 wishlist – what we’d love to see\n\n**A new world**\n\nBayonetta and Bayonetta 2 both had distinct visual personalities that could be\nfelt across their variety of stages. The third instalment should try its best\nto maintain this unique flair with brand new locations.\n\nWhile somewhat grounded in reality, Bayonetta’s characters are so utterly\noutlandish that they can pretty much go anywhere. Platinum Games should\ncapitalise on this by producing an experience that will keep us guessing right\nuntil the end.\n\n**Even bigger levels**\n\nBayonetta certainly benefits from tightly-designed combat arenas, but that\ndoesn’t mean Platinum Games is incapable of extending its reach and throwing\nour favourite Witch into a massive battlefield. The conflicts envisioned in\nBayonetta’s lore are absolutely huge, and seeing them realised in-game would\nbe a marvel to witness.\n\nIt’d be ideal to see these more ambitious encounters balanced with traditional\nbattles where intricate combos and fast-reaction times are key to victory.\nBalancing skill and spectacle might be the ingredient needed for Bayonetta 3\nto be something special.\n\n**Related:[The World Ends With You – Final\nRemix](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/the-world-ends-with-you-final-\nremix-release-date-trailer-gameplay-pre-order-switch-3370400)**\n\n![bayonetta\n3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\n**Surprising new enemies**\n\nAngels have been the primary enemies of the Bayonetta series thus far. They\nlook beautiful, but we’ve seen the same designs again and again throughout the\npast two outings. We’d love to see the third one introduce a new style of\nadversary that comes in all shapes and sizes.\n\nThis addition would come part and parcel with a new setting, since a\ndistinctive new location wouldn’t be filled with everything we’ve seen before.\nWell, hopefully that’s the case.\n\n_**What would you like to see from Bayonetta 3?
