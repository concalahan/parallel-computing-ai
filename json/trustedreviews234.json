There’s\na lot get through, so we’ve compiled everything you need to know about 2018\nincluding all the must-see trailers, briefings and more.**\n\nThe conference itself has opened its doors after we saw a number of press\nconferences from the key players in the industry. EA and Microsoft got the\nball rolling with [EA Play 2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-\nwatch-ea-e3-press-conference-3480091) and [Microsoft’s own\nkeynote](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-watch-xbox-e3-2018-press-\nconference-3475364), and [Bethesda](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-\nto-watch-bethesda-e3-press-conference-3480032), [Square\nEnix](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-watch-square-\nenix-e3-2018-conference-3478151),\n[Ubisoft](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-watch-ubisoft-e3-press-\nconference-3480123), [Sony](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-watch-\nsony-ps4-e3-2018-press-conference-3471683) and\n[Nintendo](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-watch-nintendo-\ndirect-e3-2018-3477902) followed with presentations of their own. Read on for\nfull details of everything that has been announced thus far, and keep checking\nback on this page as we update it with our hands-on impressions of the\nplayable games.\n\n**Related:[When is Amazon Prime\nDay?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/amazon-prime-day-2018-3482743)**\n\nLet’s kick-off by taking a closer look at what the biggest E3 players –\nincluding Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft, EA, Bethesda and more – have been up at\nthe world’s biggest games show.\n\n## Nintendo at E3 2018\n\nNow that Nintendo has proven the worth of its latest console, the [Nintendo\nSwitch](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nintendo-switch), it’s time to\nbulk out its library with fantastic games.\n\nAs a result, E3 2018 gave us our best look yet at [Super Smash Bros\nUltimate](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/smash-bros-nintendo-switch-\nrelease-date-gameplay-2949964), with a host of new characters announced (Star\nFox’s Wolf and Metroid’s Ridley are a playable characters!) and a December\n2018 release date given.\n\nWe also got the news that Epic Games’ [Fortnite Battle\nRoyale](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/fortnite-battle-royale) will be\navailable on Switch tonight, so you’ve one more platform to play the global\nblockbuster. The new version will also offer cross-play with the Xbox One, PC,\nmobile, although PS4 cross-play is not supported.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Acer Predator Orion 9000\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/acer-predator-orion-9000 \"Acer\nPredator Orion 9000\")\n\n  * [ ![ipad pro 2018 leak](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Image Credit: @VenyaGeskin1/Twitter \n\n### New iPad Pro 2018 leaks suggest Apple will drop the Home button but keep\nthings notchless\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ipad-pro-2018-release-date-specs-\nprice-3482812 \"New iPad Pro 2018 leaks suggest Apple will drop the Home button\nbut keep things notchless\")\n\n  *   * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### MacBook Air 2018: Retina display and mini bezels tipped for new ‘entry-\nlevel’ model\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/new-macbook-air-2018-release-\ndate-3433474 \"MacBook Air 2018: Retina display and mini bezels tipped for new\n‘entry-level’ model\")\n\n  * \n\nFinally, we also got our first look at Fire Emblem: Three Houses, an upcoming\nstrategy RPG. That was it in terms of major announcements, although be sure to\ncheck out our [Nintendo E3 guide](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-\nwatch-nintendo-direct-e3-2018-3477902) for a full rundown.\n\nOverall, it was a somewhat predictable conference. That’s no bad thing, but it\nwould have been nice to see a surprise or two such as an update on [Metroid\nPrime 4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/metroid-prime-4-release-date-\ngameplay-news-trailer-characters-story-preorder-2993245). Nintendo knows what\nit’s doing, which occasionally means it gets a little bit predictable.\n\n## Microsoft at E3 2018\n\nIt has the hardware, now it needs the games, and Microsoft delivered with\namazing style at E3 2018. The console manufacturer’s conference was almost\nentirely a non-stop announcement bonanza, as game after game received new\ndetails, demonstrations and trailers.\n\nThe highlight of the show was undoubtedly [Cyberpunk\n2077](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/cyberpunk-2077-release-date-trailer-\ngameplay-story-2948412), which closed out the conference with its first in-\ngame trailer, but Microsoft also announced all new games ranging from [Forza\nHorizon 4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/forza-horizon-4-release-date-\nnews-trailer-gameplay-wishlist-cars-3382198) to [Halo\nInfinite](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/halo-infinite-release-\ndate-3484012) and [Gears of War 5](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/gears-\nof-war-5-news-release-date-2949338).\n\nThird party publishers also saw their games announced at the conference with\n[Just Cause 4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/just-cause-4-release-\ndate-3478275) and [Devil May Cry 5](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/devil-\nmay-cry-5-dmc-release-date-3334071) receiving debut trailers.\n\n**Related:[Best Xbox One Deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-\nxbox-one-deals-2993078)**\n\nFinally, a number of games we already knew about received their fair share of\nnew trailers including From Software’s [Shadows Die\nTwice](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/shadows-die-twice-release-\ndate-3370450), [Fallout\n76](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/fallout-76-release-date-3479330),\n[Crackdown 3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/crackdown-3), [Shadow of\nthe Tomb Raider](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/shadow-of-the-tomb-\nraider-release-date-preview-2939265) and [Kingdom Hearts\n3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/kingdom-hearts-3-release-date-2993095)\nreceived fantastic chunks of new footage we couldn’t help get excited about.\n\nBe sure to check out our [full guide to Microsoft’s E3 2018\nconference](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-watch-\nxbox-e3-2018-press-conference-3475364) for a full summary of all the\nannouncements.\n\n**Related:**[ **Best Xbox One\nGames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-xbox-one-games-3435271)\n\n## Sony at E3 2018\n\nAlthough Sony made a handful of announcements in the run up to E3, such as\nannouncing that popular VR game Beatsaber will be coming to PlayStation VR and\nfinally giving zombie game Gone Home a release date, we got the main bulk of\ninformation from [Sony’s conference](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/sony-\nplaystation-e3-2018-press-conference-how-to-watch-playstation-3471683).\n\nHere, the focus was on giving extended looks at a small number of big games.\nWe saw an extended piece of gameplay from  [The Last of Us Part\n2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/last-of-us-2-release-date-gameplay-\ntrailer-pre-order-news-wishlist-2944236), [Spider-\nMan](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/spiderman-ps4-2993195) and [Ghosts of\nTsushima](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ghost-of-tsushima-release-date-\ntrailers-story-3319443), and [Death\nStranding](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/death-stranding-release-\ndate-2947317) made another appearance that was just as bizarre and confusing\nas ever. It was a mixture of gameplay and cinematics, but still pretty damn\nconfusing.\n\nThere were a couple of smaller announcements thrown into the mix as well. Nioh\n2 and Remedy’s Control was revealed, and we also saw a brand new PlayStation\nVR announcement from FromSoftware, Dérasciné.\n\nOh, and there was yet another [Kingdom Hearts\n3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/kingdom-hearts-3-release-date-worlds-\nnews-trailers-and-rumours-2993095) trailer, because we haven’t seen enough of\nthat game already at E3 this year.\n\nOverall, the conference didn’t have nearly the amount of punch as what\nMicrosoft had to offer. It’s not that anything we saw was bad, but the\nconference was lacking in surprises, and it was a shame not to see any new\ntitles announced.\n\n**Related:[Best PS4 deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-\nps4-deals-2993085)**\n\n## EA at E3 2018\n\nPersonally, we hate going first, but EA seems to relish it, and scheduled its\nown press conference for the Saturday before E3 2018 kicked off. During the\nshow, it attempted to focus equally on big-budget AAA titles as well as\nsmaller indie titles.\n\nWe saw small glimpses of [Battlefield\n5](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/battlefield-5-release-date-3231890) and\n[FIFA 19](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/fifa-19-release-date-3379113).\nThe former received an announcement that it would be getting its own Battle\nRoyale mode in an update after its release, and the latter will feature the\nUEFA Champion’s League.\n\nIndie titles like Sea of Solitude and Unravel 2 also got demonstrations, and\nthe latter even got a surprise announcement that it’s available right now.\n\nCommand and Conquer: Rivals, a new mobile strategy experience was also\nannounced with an on-stage presentation. NBA Live 19 and [Madden NFL\n19](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/madden-19-release-date-3466838)\nreceived new trailers alongside release details.\n\nSaving the best until last,\n[Anthem](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/anthem-release-date-gameplay-\nrelease-date-preorder-news-2951518) received a huge amount of new information\nthrough a cinematic trailer and developer insight into gameplay, story and how\nmonetization will work in the upcoming RPG (in short: there’ll be cosmetic\nitems to purchase but no loot boxes). Bioware also provided us with plenty of\nnew footage of Anthem in action. It looks fantastic, and could really be\nsomething special. ****\n\n**Related:**[ **Upcoming PS4\nGames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/upcoming-ps4-games)\n\n## Bethesda at E3 2018\n\nBethesda’s conference this year was a slightly odd mix of games that we should\nexpect very shortly, and others that won’t be available for years to come.\n\nRepresenting the latter were [The Elder Scrolls\n6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/elders-scrolls-6-release-date-2993132)\nand [Starfield](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/starfield-release-\ndate-3484396), while in the former camp we got a November release date for\n[Fallout 76](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/fallout-76-release-\ndate-3479330) and the announcement of an ambitious new cross-platform Elder\nScrolls experience called ‘Blades’ which will bring together platforms as\ndiverse as mobile phones and PC virtual reality.\n\n[Rage 2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/rage-2-release-date-3472822)\nreceived a new gameplay trailer, and we can’t wait to try out the game for\nourselves.\n\nDoom received a sequel with [Doom\nEternal](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/doom-eternal-release-\ndate-3483704), and [Wolfenstein\nYoungblood](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/wolfenstein-youngblood-\nrelease-date-3484374) will offer another opportunity to kill some alternative\nhistory Nazis.\n\nCheck out our full coverage of the conference on our [Bethesda E3 2018\npage](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-watch-bethesda-e3-press-\nconference-3480032).\n\n## Ubisoft at E3 2018\n\nUbisoft brought some serious fun at this year’s E3. Opening its conference\nwith a big marching band (a tie in to Just Dance 2019), the publisher then had\na developer drive a motorcycle into the auditorium to announce Trials Rising.\n\nElsewhere it was a more predictable conference. [Beyond Good and Evil\n2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/beyond-good-and-evil-2-release-\ndate-2993129) got a new trailer after its surprise announcement last year, and\n[Assassin’s Creed Odyssey](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/assassins-\ncreed-odyssey-release-date-gameplay-3480002) was fully detailed featuring RPG\nelements and a choice of assassins to play as.\n\n[The Division 2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/the-division-2-release-\ndate-3415602) received a host of new details, including the news that the game\nwill feature raids for the first time, and [Skull and\nBones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/skull-and-bones-release-\ndate-2993779) got another pair of trailers.\n\nFinally, Nintendo made a brief appearance to announce Starfox for Starlink:\nBattle for Atlas, a new toys-to-life venture by Ubisoft.\n\n## Square Enix at E3 2018\n\nSquare Enix haven’t done their own presentation at E3 for a number of years,\nand its presentation this year was a good indication of why. The company just\ndidn’t have anything new to announce, so while we got extended looks at\n[Kingdom Hearts 3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/kingdom-\nhearts-3-release-date-2993095), [Shadow of the Tomb\nRaider](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-release-\ndate-preview-2939265), and [Just Cause\n4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/just-cause-4-release-date-3478275), the\npresentation was light on new details.\n\nThat being said, Platinum Games’ Babylon’s Fall looked incredibly cool, and\ncould be the cryptic action title the studio has been teasing in recent\nmonths.\n\nCheck out our [full guide to Square Enix’s\npresentation](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-watch-square-\nenix-e3-2018-conference-3478151) for a complete overview of what was\nannounced.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Related:**[ **Upcoming Switch\nGames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/upcoming-nintendo-switch-\ngames-2018)\n\n## E3 2018 date – when is it?\n\nE3 2018 takes place from **June 12 – 14**.\n\nThe big publishers such as Sony, Microsoft, Bethesda, EA, and Nintendo will be\nholding press conferences and streams ahead of the event itself.
