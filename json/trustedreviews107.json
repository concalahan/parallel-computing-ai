The\nstandard comes with Dynamic HDR support, which will optimise colours in each\nscene, and even each individual frame.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThat should mean the display constantly adapts to produce the best picture\npossible at each moment, with each scene or frame being displayed at its ideal\nvalues for depth, detail, brightness, contrast and wider colour gamuts.\n\nWhat’s more, HDMI 2.1 and its cabling are backward compatible but\nmanufacturers will take a while to start integrating the new specification\ninto their products.\n\nThe HDMI Forum has also added Game Mode VRR support, which allows for variable\nrefresh rates and reduces screen tearing and input lag when gaming.\n\nThis new Game mode spec, which is similar to the G-Sync and FreeSync\ntechnologies already available, will also apparently work with both PCs and\nconsoles.\n\nAnd finally, there’s built-in support for object-based audio, which means\nyou’ll be able to use the new cables and ports with Dolby Atmos sound and\nalike.\n\n**Related:[What is Dolby\nAtmos?](https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-\ninstant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=dolby%20atmos%20trustedreviews)**\n\nObject-based audio such as this expands the previous 5.1 and 7.1 setups to\ninclude numerous speakers which are placed around a room to create an all-\nenveloping, “3D” sound experience.\n\nWhile numerous TVs have also been announced at CES, none have yet been\nconfirmed as coming with the new HDMI 2.1 standard, so we’ll have to wait for\nmore detailed specs.\n\nHDMI 2.1 will be released in the second quarter of 2017, but it will take a\nwhile for products that come with the new spec to arrive.  \n **  \nWATCH: Trusted Explains: All you need to know about TVs  \n**\n\n**Let us know what you think of the new standard in the comments.**  \n ****\n\n"}
