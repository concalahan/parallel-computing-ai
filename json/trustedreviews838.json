It started off with the\ncritically acclaimed [Galaxy S7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-\ngalaxy-s7-review) and [S7 Edge](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-\ngalaxy-s7-edge-review) and it’s finishing off with the Note 7. That’s three\nphones that all have the potential to be ‘Smartphone of the Year’ candidates\nin the upcoming _TrustedReviews_ Awards.\n\nIn typical fashion, Apple has been much less busy. Aside from the [iPhone\nSE](https://www.trustedreviews.com/iphone-se-review), we’re yet to see much\nfrom Cupertino in 2016. That means we’re stuck with the [iPhone\n6S](https://www.trustedreviews.com/iphone-6s-review) and [iPhone 6S\nPlus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/iphone-6s-plus-review).\n\nSo how does Sammy’s latest phablet compare to Apple’s current big-screened\nking? Let’s take a look.\n\n**Related:[Galaxy Note 7 review](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-\ngalaxy-note-7-review)**\n\n![samsung galaxy note\n7](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\n## Note 7 vs iPhone 6S Plus – Design\n\nWe’d have been laughed out of the room a few years ago if we’d have suggested\nthat Samsung built better-looking phones than Apple. But that’s the truth\nthese days.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nContinuing the dual-curved-edge design of the S7 Edge, the Note 7’s display\nslopes down on either side, and it looks stunning. It catches the eye so much\nmore than the iPhone, which at this stage is starting to look a little dated.\nThose curved edges also make the Note much sleeker and more manageable to hold\nthan the iPhone 6S Plus, even though the Samsung’s actually the phone with the\nbigger screen.\n\n**Read also:[iPhone 7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-7-release-\ndate-price-rumours-video-images-features-uk)**\n\nThe screen bezel is also much more of an issue on the iPhone. Whereas the\nGalaxy Note 7 keeps its one to a minimum, the bezel is wide and noticeable on\nApple’s phone. The thing is, if the rumours about the iPhone 7 are to be\nbelieved then that won’t solve this problem either, as both phones are\nrumoured to look very similar.\n\n**Related:[Apple Student Discount\nexplained](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-student-discount-uk-1)**  \n **  \nWatch: Galaxy Note 7 vs iPhone 6S Plus**\n\nWith the iPhone 6S Plus, Apple has largely stuck to the same formula that\nworked so well with the 6 Plus. It has the same aluminium body design and the\nrose gold colour isn’t as tacky as it sounds.\n\nOther things you’ll inevitably notice are that the speaker, charging ports and\nheadphone jacks are all still at the bottom of the Note 7. The positioning of\nthe volume rocker and standby button likewise haven’t changed, but the Micro\nUSB socket has been switched out for the fancy reversible USB-C type. A first\nfor Samsung.\n\nFingerprint sensors are the norm now and the Note 7 has one baked into the\nhome button. It’s fast and accurate and the easiest way to unlock the phone.\nIt’s been joined by an iris scanner, a sensor that sits next to the front-\nfacing camera and scans your eyes.\n\n**Related:[Galaxy Note 7 vs Note 5 vs Note\n4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-7-vs-note-5-vs-\nnote-4)**\n\n![iPhone 6S Plus\n11](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nApple has fingerprint security covered with its Touch ID setup. Both can\nsupport mobile payments, with Apple Pay and Android Pay/Samsung Pay,\nrespectively, but the latter has still yet to see a release in the UK.\n\nWe mustn’t forget about the S Pen. Samsung’s phone has a stylus and the iPhone\n6S Plus doesn’t. Depending on how you feel about scribbling down notes , this\nmight not be an issue for you. The new S Pen is a lot more sensitive than\nbefore, making it better for sketching, and like the phone it’s waterproof.\nBasically, this means you can doodle in the shower.\n\n## Note 7 vs iPhone 6S Plus – Performance and Power\n\nEven though the iPhone 6S Plus is approaching its first birthday, it’s still\none of the fastest phones on the market. The Apple’s A9 CPU and 2GB of RAM\nmight not be quite as potent on paper as the octa-core CPU and 4GB of RAM in\nthe Galaxy Note 7, but we wouldn’t say there will be much difference in real-\nworld performance. Both will handle all the latest games, intensive apps and\nthe like without breaking a sweat.\n\nA real differentiator between the two is the starting storage. Samsung kits\nthe Note 7 out with 64GB as standard, but Apple still starts off at a pathetic\n16GB, forcing you to splash out more for the 64GB and 128GB models. What’s\nmore is that there’s a microSD card slot on the Note 7, meaning you’ll be able\nto expand that base 64GB further. We doubt there’ll ever be expandable storage\non an iPhone.\n\n**Related:[ Galaxy Note 7 vs Galaxy\nS7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-7-vs-galaxy-s7)**\n\n![samsung galaxy note\n7](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\n## Note 7 vs iPhone 6S Plus – Display\n\nThese are two great smartphone displays to use and you won’t be disappointed\nif you opt for either, but there’s a big difference in terms of pure tech.\n\nThe Note 7 has the larger 5.7-inch screen in comparison to Apple’s 5.5-inch\none, and the screen-to-body ratio is superior on Samsung’s phone, as Apple\ngoes heavy on the bezel. The display on the Galaxy Note 7 is also much more\neye-catching, simply because it’s curved heavily on either side.\n\nThe two phones opt for two very different screen technologies, with Apple\nsticking to an IPS LCD and Samsung using an AMOLED display.\n\nSamsung outdoes Apple when it comes to resolution, with the Note 7 packing a\nquad-HD panel and Apple sticking to Full HD 1080p. In reality, though, both\ndisplays make it hard to spot pixels and you might be hard pushed to tell\nwhich is better unless you have them next to each other. For the first time,\nthe display on the Note 7 is ‘Mobile HDR-ready’ which should give you better\ncontrast and a wider range between the blacks and the whites.\n\nOne trick the iPhone 6S Plus does have is its 3D Touch tech. This is a\npressure-sensitive layer built into the display that reacts differently\ndepending on how hard you press it. Hard-pressing on the camera icon, for\nexample, can take you straight to shooting a video or a selfie.\n\n**Related:[What’s new with the Galaxy Gear\nVR?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-unveils-new-gear-vr-2-for-\nnote-7-headset-what-s-new-features-all-you-need-to-know)**\n\n![iPhone 6S Plus\n7](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\n## Note 7 vs iPhone 6S Plus – Camera\n\nWhile we haven’t spent enough time with the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 to really\njudge its snapper, due to it having the same setup as the Galaxy S7 we can\nassume it’s going to be fantastic. The combination of a 12-megapixel Dual\nPixel sensor and f/1.7 aperture makes it the best phone camera on the market,\nwhile the 5MP front-facing camera is only beaten by the [HTC\n10](https://www.trustedreviews.com/htc-10-review). It’s a potent combination\nthat also features 4K recording, slow-motion video and a boatload of extras.\n\nThe iPhone 6S Plus also has a great camera, again with 12 megapixels and 4K\nrecording. Apple’s cameras tend to be more colour accurate than Samsung’s,\nwith less post-processing and a cleaner, more lifelike look.\n\nOptical image stabilisation is present on both, a vital feature for keeping\nlow-light shots steady, and both have a fairly run-of-the-mill flash.\n\n**Related:[Galaxy Note 7 UK release date – how to pre-order\ntoday](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-7-release-date-\nprice-revealed-uk-pre-order-buy-best-deals-free-gear-vr)**\n\n![iPhone 6S Plus\n13](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Note 7 vs iPhone 6S Plus – Software\n\niOS vs Android – it’s the age-old debate in the phone world. (Well, since 2008\nanyway.) We’re not going to get into the nitty gritty here, but suffice to say\nboth have their benefits and problems. iOS is great if you’re committed to the\nApple ecosystem, while Android offers more customisability and deeper\nintegration with Google’s massive selection of services.\n\nLike every other Galaxy phone, the Note 7 uses Samsung’s own overlay on top of\nAndroid 6.0.1. This skin is a bit Marmite – you’ll either love it or hate it –\nbut it’s the best it’s ever been. Note 7-exclusive features mainly revolve\naround the S Pen, so you can take notes when the screen is off or translate\nsome text while hovering over it.\n\nThere’s also the Secure Folder, which keeps personal items locked away behind\neither a scan of your eyes or a fingerprint. It’s a nice touch, and one that\nwe’re sure a lot of people will take advantage of.\n\n**Related:[How to unlock an iPhone](https://www.trustedreviews.com/how-\ntos/unlock-iphone-ee-vodapone-three-o2-sim-uk-network-free)**\n\n![samsung galaxy note\n7](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nThe iPhone 6S Plus ships with iOS 9, but it’ll be updated to iOS 10 when it\nlaunches later in the year. This is a big step forward, with a new lock\nscreen, updated widget support and a bunch of new features. It’s still very\nmuch the iOS we know, just tweaked. It’s free too, so gives the iPhone 6S Plus\na new breath of life just as the new model launches.\n\n## Note 7 vs iPhone 6S Plus – Battery Life\n\nBig phones should deliver much better battery performance than their smaller\ncounterparts, as there’s much more space to jam in that extra capacity.\n\nKeeping the Galaxy Note 7 chugging along is a 3,500mAh cell, which is actually\nsmaller than the one in the S7 Edge, but larger than the 3,000mAh cell in last\nyear’s Note 5.\n\nInterestingly, the cell inside the iPhone 6S Plus is marginally smaller than\nthe one in the 6 Plus – it’s dropped down from 2,915mAh to 2,750, but thanks\nto a more power-efficient chip and all those battery improvements in iOS 9, it\nlasts about the same amount of time as its older brother.\n\nThe iPhone 6S Plus had great battery life when we first unboxed it, but months\nlater it’s starting to drop. While it’ll still get us through the day, it’s\ndropped about 20-30% over 9 months.\n\n![samsung galaxy note\n7](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nWe haven’t had enough time to fully test out the battery on the Note 7, but\nyou’ll be happy to hear it’s fully loaded with extras. There’s wireless\ncharging, fast charging and it’s the first Samsung phone to use USB-C.\n\n## Note 7 vs iPhone 6S Plus – Early Verdict\n\nThese are two great phones, but hard to compare, as they’ve come out at such\ndifferent times. Both are pricey, high-powered phones, but the Note 7 is the\nnewer model and as such has many more advancements than the iPhone 6S Plus.\n\n**[Buy Now: Galaxy Note 7 at Amazon.com from $903](http://amzn.to/2bJSvIw)**\n\nWe’ll have to spend more time with the Note 7 to really see how good it is.\n\n**[Buy Now: iPhone 6S Plus at Amazon.com from $695](http://amzn.to/2bsGgm5)  \n**  \n **Related:[Best phones 2016](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-android-\nphones-1_round-up)**\n\n**Watch The Refresh: The best tech gossip and reviews every week**\n\n**Which phablet reigns supreme, Apple’s iPhone 6S Plus or Samsung’s new Note\n7?
