It\nfeatures a 5-inch, downward firing sub woofer, a mid-range driver and three\ntweeters. The whole unit is clad in a wool-blend fabric, which is available in\ngrey or black.\n\nThere are no buttons on the M5, but the top plate rotates to change volume and\npressing down acts as the Play/Pause function. It’s a very neat design. I love\nthe fabric finish, which would fit in well in any home. B&O Play insists it’s\nnot in the business of designing ‘ just electronics’ and you can see that in\nthe look and feel of the M5.\n\nThe M5 supports every imaginable method of wireless audio, including Beolink\nMultiroom (working with other Beoplay speakers), Spotify Connects, QPlay 2.0,\nApple AirPlay, Bluetooth and, rather neatly, Chromecast Audio.\n\nI only got to hear a few short samples from the M5, but what I heard was\nimpressive. It was detailed, full-bodied and powerful.\n\nThe Beoplay M5 is on sale now for £529, or $599, and we hope to have a unit in\nfor review soon.\n\n"}
