We've\ngot all the details you need to know about the next big TV resolution.\n\n**In the world of consumer tech, nothing stands still for very long. And so no\nsooner has[4K](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/what-is-4k-2908860)\nfinally started to make sense – with 4K Blu-rays now commonplace and the likes\nof Netflix, Amazon, [Sky Q](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sky-q) and\nBBC iPlayer streaming hours upon hours of 4K content – than manufacturer’s are\nstarting to look to what’s next. The answer? 8K TVs of course. **\n\nThe next-gen resolution is already big news, with talk of 8K displays making\nit to market before the year is out, and even 8K broadcasts planned by 2020.\n\nBut is 8K something that you should care about right now? We’ve broken down\neverything you need to know about TV’s next big thing.\n\n**Related:[Best TV deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/tv-deals-cheap-\nsales-2993362)**\n\n## What is 8K and why should I care about 8K TVs?\n\nWhen we talk about 8K, we’re talking about the resolution of the screen we’re\nlooking at, which equates to the number of horizontal and vertical pixels that\na screen can display.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThe more pixels of an image we see, the better quality the image should be, as\nyou’re getting more of the finer detail that lesser screens gloss over.\n\nWith 8K, you get a total resolution of 7680 pixels horizontally and 4320\npixels vertically – four times the pixels you’ll get with 4K (2840 x 2160) and\n16 times that of Full HD (1920 x 1080).\n\n## 4K vs 8K: Isn’t 4K enough?\n\n4K is superb, and if you haven’t upgraded your home TV to 4K yet, you’ll be\namazed at the differences between 4K content and the Full HD you’ve been\nwatching. In theory, 8K will offer a similar leap.\n\nThe differences might not be quite as stark, but when you’re looking to get\nthe most immersive experience possible, the more detail you can pack into a\nshot, the better.\n\nIn practical terms, it’s the difference between looking at an 8-megapixel\npicture and a 33-megapixel picture – with an HD picture being just 2\nmegapixels by comparison. For the naysayers doubting whether those extra\npixels will be worth it, we’d argue there’s a good chance they will.\n\n## What 8K TVs are there? When will 8K TVs be released?\n\nManufacturers have been talking about 8K before 4K was even really\nestablished, but at CES 2018 and [IFA\n2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ifa-2018-3497586), that talk has\nfinally been getting serious.\n\nSharp is already on its second-generation 8K television, producing the\n£100,000, 85-inch LV-85001 for the Japanese market a couple of years ago now,\nit’s familiar household manufacturers like Samsung and LG showcasing more\nconsumer-focused sets that have really got interests piqued.\n\nUnbelievably, the [Samsung\nQ900R](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-q900r-8k) is almost\nready for market and is expected to launch in September or October 2018,\ndepending on where you live – the UK is getting the latter release date, but\nit still should be available well in time for Christmas.\n\nLG is setting itself a more leisurely timeline, predicting five million sets\nwill be sold by 2022. Toshiba and Sony have also shown off concept 8K sets at\nrecent shows, but they remain very much in the planning stages for now.\n\n![Samsung\nQ900](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## How much with an 8K TV cost?\n\nThe Samsung Q900R will be available in an 85-inch model to begin with,\nfollowed by 82-, 75- and 65-inch versions at a later date.\n\nNo prices have been announced for any of them just yet, but we predict you’re\ngoing to have to set aside a fairly hefty budget if you want to bring one of\nthese home in time for the holidays – as a rough idea, Sharp’s existing\n70-inch 8K TV costs €11,199.\n\n## Does 8K need a big screen?\n\nThe average size of our TVs has been slowly shifting upwards in recent years.\nThat’s down to a combination of reduced prices, improved design, and higher\nquality picture resolution.\n\nAs screens get larger, pixel density decreases, soo higher resolutions simply\nmake more sense on bigger TVs.\n\nThat explains why the majority of 8K demos have been shown on screens of 85\ninches and above, although as we’ve mentioned, Samsung has announced its Q900R\nwill eventually be available in a more accessible 65 inches – much more living\nroom friendly, and no doubt much cheaper too.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## What can I watch in 8K?\n\nLong story short? There isn’t really any 8K content right now, but that\ndoesn’t mean it isn’t on its way.\n\nJapan (where else?) ran some 8K demo broadcasts on its TV channel NHK back in\n2016, and has since announced plans for a dedicated 8K TV channel later this\nyear, where Tokyo’s 2020 Olympic Games will be broadcast in the format.\n\nBrazil even showed some of the 2018 World Cup in 8K, at Rio de Janeiro’s\nscience museum, though the tech support required to make it happen was far\nfrom straightforward, so it’s not exactly ready for mass consumption just yet.\n\nFrom a film perspective, Hollywood has already dipped its toe in the water\nwith 8K – just as it started with 4K long before that was really a ‘thing’.\n\nCurrently, it’s mostly to give editors more options in the editing suite than\nit is for actually producing an 8K movie, but the equipment is out there to\nmake these kinds of films happen when the time is right.\n\nIn fact, the first one is already in the can. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\n(2017) was the first film to be shot on RED’s 8K Vista Vision camera, and we\nexpect to see plenty more following in its footsteps in the next year or two.\n\nThere’s also things like VR to think about. The £4200 [GoPro Omni\nVR](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/gopro-omni-vr-virtual-\nreality-360-camera-spherical-buy-price-2946765) might not be in many budgets,\nbut it is capable of shooting at an 8K 30fps spherical resolution for VR. The\nInsta360 Pro camera offers similar virtual reality shooting, while the oft-\nrumoured [Apple AR/VR\nheadset](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-t288-ar-vr-headset-\nrumours-3465506) is thought to be packing dual 8K displays – one for each eye.\n\nGaming isn’t one for lagging behind the curve, either, with a plethora of\nYouTube videos showing 8K–- and, whisper it, even 16K – gaming rigs. The [Dell\nCanvas UP3218K](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/dell-canvas-up318k-specs-\nlaunch-2949083) gaming monitor is 8K capable, but the hardware to make it\nhappen is slightly more complicated.\n\nA [Thirty IR Witcher III playthrough in\n8K](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNz-CLzEcCs) last year required four\nNvidia GTX Titan Xp graphics cards costing $1200 each to achieve – and that’s\nbefore you even get to the processor and memory required. Hardly a hobby, for\nnow at least.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## What else is happening right now? What is 8K upscaling?\n\nWith so little content currently available, 8K right now is really all about\nupscaling, and from what we’ve seen at recent shows, the results can be pretty\nimpressive.\n\nFor example, Samsung’s Q900R uses the company’s new Quantum Processor 8K chip,\nwhich uses ‘AI upscaling’ to boost lower-res footage to 8K.\n\nThis uses complex algorithms to recognise patterns in images and calculate the\nextra pixels required to fill in the gaps that 4K (or even HD) is missing. The\nchip uses a huge image database, which Samsung says will be constantly updated\nto keep it as accurate as possible.\n\nSony showed off similarly impressive upscaling at CES 2018 using a concept 8K\npanel and its forthcoming X1 Ultimate processor, though that remains very much\na ‘watch this space’ endeavour for now.\n\n## 8K vs 4K TVs: Should I buy a 4K TV or wait for 8K?\n\nThat’s the big question and, for now at least, the answer is pretty clear cut.\n\nAs there’s not really any true 8K content yet, you’d only really be buying an\n8K TV for bragging rights and to get a glimpse of its potential via upscaling\n– we’re still a long way from seeing 8K hit the mainstream. After all, there’s\nonly really one 8K TV you can likely buy!\n\nRemember: 4K is still far from ubiquitous, and given the amount of investment\nin the technology by major networks, studios and companies, it’s extremely\nunlikely it will be usurped any time soon in the consumer market.\n\nThose wanting to get the most out of their TV viewing experience right now\nshould therefore buy 4K – whether it’s as an upgrade from Full HD or a ‘good\nto great’ 4K swap. There are loads of great affordable options out there, like\nthe [Panasonic TX-50CX680](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/panasonic-\ntx-50cx680), and you’re spoilt for choice if you can stretch to a high-end\nUltra HD set (the [Samsung\nQ9FN](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-q9fn-qled) and [LG G8\nOLED](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/lg-c8-oled) spring to mind).\n\n**Related:[Best 4K TVs](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-4k-tvs)**\n\nThe 8K vs 4K TV battle may now be nascent, but buying a quality 4K TV will\nserve you well for some time and comes as our recommendation for most people.\n\n**Are you excited for the advent of 8K TV, or is it all just hype?
