You play the\nrole of a Guardian, a defender of last city on Earth who wields a power called\nLight gifted by a giant alien moon called the Traveller. Gameplay takes place\nacross a series of hub worlds in the form of various planets and moons within\nour solar system. There’s a heavy focus on loot and grinding for better stats\nand gear which which to equip your character.\n\n* * *\n\n**Buy Destiny 2 from[Amazon](https://amzn.to/2wxPauD)**\n\n* * *\n\nA robust story campaign acts as a solid introduction to Destiny 2’s systems\nand universe, but things don’t really come to life until you’ve finished the\nmain plotline. From there you can explore the various hub worlds, compete in\ncompetitive multiplayer or team up with your fellow Guardians to take on\nStrikes – instanced missions distinct from the main world which offer further\ninsight into the universe and lore as you with take down a powerful foe.\n\nIf you’re returning to Destiny 2 after a long hiatus, you’ll be struck by just\nhow little has changed since launch. There have been tweaks and rebalances for\nsure, but unless you’re willing to pony up the extra cash for the DLC add-ons,\nDestiny 2 has very little to offer returning players. The value proposition is\nstill mostly intact for new players though, so if you’re considering diving in\nfresh then you’ll find plenty to like.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n**Related:[Call of Duty Black Ops 4 latest\nnews](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-4-3373836)**\n\n![Best multiplayer\ngames](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nBungie has a legendary pedigree in the\n[FPS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-fps-games) market having\ncreated the Halo series and hasn’t lost its touch since the split from\nMicrosoft. No other game in existence comes close to nailing the gunplay in\nDestiny. Every weapon class feels distinct and viable and even two guns of the\nsame type can feel worlds apart. It has never been this fun to shoot things,\nwhich is good, because you’ll be shooting all of the things.\n\nThe campaign is an entertaining romp through some of the more obscure parts of\nour solar system as you seek out a way to defeat the evil forces of the Cabal.\nThe introductory cutscene shows the Dominus Ghaul and his Red Legion doing a\nspot of light redecorating on the Tower – Destiny’s hub world – and blowing it\nto pieces. They also attach a moon-sized chastity belt to the Traveller, which\nsucks the light out of the Guardians, leaving them powerless to defend\nthemselves. It’s an intriguing set-up which establishes you as the underdog in\nthe fight right off the bat.\n\nBut while the campaign is certainly enjoyable, it’s also entirely forgettable.\nI played it through several times when the game launched, once for each\ncharacter class, and barring a couple of amusing one-liners from Cayde-6, the\nVanguard of the Hunter class, I can’t remember much of what happened. Bad guys\nturned up, there was some mild peril, and everything was back to normal by the\nend.\n\nWhen you’re done with the campaign, your goal changes from saving the world to\nacquiring better gear. Loot is the name of the game in Destiny 2 and basically\neverything you do will be in search of a sweet new pair of kicks and a\nmatching rocket launcher. You’ll find all this new stuff by completing\nstrikes, multiplayer matches and events scattered across the hub worlds. New\ngear drops at a slightly higher level than your current equipment, so there’s\na steady stream of goodies coming your way until you hit the upper limit,\nthough you’ll have to look to specific missions like the Nightfall strike and\nRaid to eek your way up through the last few levels.\n\n**Related:[E3 2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/e3-2018-2949170)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe endgame for all this grinding is the Raid, a massive six-person mission to\ntake down the former Emperor of the Cabal aboard his enormous spaceship. Much\nlike the original Destiny’s raids, this mission requires a mixture of\nknowledge, teamwork and skill to complete. It also requires you to have 5\nfriends to play with, as there is no matchmaking. This isn’t a complaint\nthough, as raids can be infuriatingly difficult even with a full team of\ncommunicating players, never mind a team of random strangers.\n\nThere are a couple of changes to Destiny 2 which will benefit new and old\nplayers alike, the most prominent of which is that DLC multiplayer maps are\nfree in public matches – you only need to own the DLC to play these maps in\nprivate matches. Activision was the last bastion of the map pack as other\npublishers transitioned to models which don’t split the player base, so this\nchange was inevitable, but welcomed nonetheless. Speaking of private matches,\nthey’re now a thing too.\n\nOne of the more noticeable changes between Destiny and its sequel was the\nchanges to weapon loadouts. Where previously players could carry both a\nspecial and heavy weapon, now both options are rolled into one power weapon\nslot. The aim was to bring balance to the multiplayer modes by reducing the\namount of one-hit kill weapons in the game, but in a game where someone can\nmash a button to become an unstoppable lighting wizard or summon burning\nhammers from out of thin air to throw at you, cheap deaths are unavoidable.\n\nThe other casualty of this change was Destiny’s PvE game modes. Even if you\ntake the multiplayer balancing argument as written, the changes are universal\nmeaning PvE players are lumbered with it too. Reduced weapon options mean\nreduced gameplay possibilities and given the repetitive nature of Destiny’s\nPvE content, these changes only serve to homogenise the experience.\n\n**Related:[Battlefield 5 latest\nnews](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/battlefield-5-release-date-gameplay-\nnews-trailer-3231890)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAnother major change was reducing the player count in standard PvP matches\nfrom six down to four per fireteam. The majority of Destiny 2’s PvE activities\nare limited to three player teams, with the raid doubling the number up to\nsix. Now the maths doesn’t work as fireteams are perpetually over or under\nstaffed as they switch between PvE and PvP modes.\n\nThis new emphasis on small fireteams sticking together and focusing fire also\nleaves the PvP feeling unwelcoming to solo-players who don’t have a full\nfireteam to roll with. It should be noted that the special Iron Banner\nmultiplayer mode has returned to 6 vs 6 gameplay, but this mode is only active\nduring specific events.\n\nIt’s weird to re-review a game and concentrate so heavily on issues which have\nbeen with it since launch, but it speaks to Destiny 2’s failure to advance\nbeyond its starting position. Apart from the paid DLC content, the latest of\nwhich we’ll get to in a separate review, basically nothing has changed since\nlaunch. There have been tweaks and balance changes, but if you’re coming back\nto Destiny 2 after a hiatus, there isn’t anything new here for you beyond new\nand exciting ways to spend money on emotes and shaders.\n\nEven if you do count the Trials of Osiris DLC as part of the package, the\npaltry campaign it offers is both painfully short and intensely repetitive.\nConsidering the price of entry stands at £17, it’s a poor showing from Bungie.\n\n* * *\n\n**Buy Destiny 2 from[Amazon](https://amzn.to/2wxPauD)**\n\n* * *\n\n## **Verdict**\n\nDespite all the criticism of its additions (and lack thereof) since launch,\nDestiny 2 remains a fantastic title for new players to pick up. A robust and\nentertaining story campaign is offered alongside a host of side activities\nthat will keep you occupied for ages. But for players who have already done\nall that stuff, Destiny 2 has precious little to offer you, even if you’re\nwilling to throw money at them for DLC.\n\n## Score\n\n  \n\n"}
