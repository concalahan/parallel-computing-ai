That\nmeans you’ll need to think on your feet with regards to uncovering gear and\npreparing for a sudden fight. The second you land, look for the nearest\nstructure in search of loot.\n\nDon’t parachute into an open field. Not only does it leave you vulnerable, it\nalso means you’ll waste precious time sprinting to a building that may already\nhave been looted. Find somewhere, get looting – and please ensure you close\nthe door behind you.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nTry to pick a structure with two or more walls surrounding it, since enemies\nwill have a smaller chance of getting the drop on you. In Fortnite, without a\nshield for protection, you’ll be dead after only a couple of shots; every bit\nof damage counts.\n\n**Related:[Best Xbox One Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-xbox-\none-games-3435271)**\n\n![Fortnite Battle\nRoyale](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Fortnite Battle Royale Guide – Have a varied inventory\n\nInventory space in Fortnite is limited to only a few slots, so you’ll\nfrequently be swapping out weapons once ammo is depleted. You’ll need to\nensure space is kept free for precious bandages, med-kits, and potions for\npatching up on the move. Always keep a few of the aforementioned items in\nstock alongside firearms and grenades; you never know when you’ll need them.\n\nWith regards to weapons, keep your inventory stocked with items capable of\ndispatching enemies from close-range and at a distance. Scoped weapons aren’t\nthe easiest to come by in Fortnite, so any type of assault rifle should\nsuffice. Shotguns, on the other hand, are absolutely everywhere and can prove\ninvaluable in a pinch.\n\n## Fortnite Battle Royale Guide – Be aware of your surroundings\n\nDeath can come at any moment in Battle Royale. Players can ambush one another\nin seconds, whether it’s a sniper across a field or a sneaky camper hiding in\na basement. Never let your guard down, and keep your eyes and ears open for\nany perceivable threat.\n\nThe majority of environments are destructible, meaning enemies are capable of\nbashing down walls and giving even the greatest of hiding spots a window of\nvulnerability. Knowing this, try not to stay in the same place too long – and\nkeep the competition guessing.\n\nOf course, it’s impossible to camp your way through an entire match; the\noncoming storm is constantly pushing players closer together into an\ninevitable slaughter. Keep on top of the storm and try to remain within it.\nYou can always pick people off from a hiding place at the border, too.\n\n**Related:[Best Nintendo Switch\nGames](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/nintendo-switch-games-3435122)**\n\n![Fortnite Battle\nRoyale](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Fortnite Battle Royale Guide – Gain the high ground\n\nJust like Obi-Wan Kenobi in _Revenge of the Sith_ , those with the high ground\nare at a distinct advantage. Not only do you have an excellent vantage point\nfor spotting oncoming threats, but you can also craft a makeshift base with\nramps, platforms and defences that enemies will have a hard time penetrating.\n\nI’ve been in multiple situations atop a hillside, where a solid perimeter has\nenabled me to make multiple kills. It’s a solid strategy, and being in the\nright spot might even lead to victory. However, try to avoid drawing any\nunnecessary attention to your position by firing shots that don’t hit the\nmark.\n\n## Fortnite Battle Royale Guide – Traps!\n\nWatching someone fall into a trap in Fortnite is immensely satisfying. It\ndeals massive amounts of damage and proves you’ve managed to outsmart someone\nand send them straight back to the main menu. There are all sorts of traps in\nFortnite that can be placed on walls, floors and ceilings.\n\nYou could lure an enemy toward some carefully placed loot with a trap laid\nabove it, or start a gunfight only to flee into a building where a horde of\ntraps awaits. Traps can normally be found alongside normal loot or in chests,\nwhich are always packed with rare goodies.\n\n**Related:[Best Gaming PC ](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/best-gaming-\npc-2993099)**\n\n![Fortnite Battle\nRoyale](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Fortnite Battle Royale Guide – Don’t underestimate crafting\n\nThe robust crafting system is what separates Fortnite from its Battle Royale\ncompetition. If you don’t have any cover then all you have to do is bust out\nsome blueprints and make it yourself. Wood, brick and steel can be formed into\na number of different structures, each with their own durability.\n\nYou can construct obstacles quite quickly, meaning they can also be used as\nspontaneous cover while on the move. Materials can be harvested using your\ntrusty pickaxe on almost everything across the map. Fortnite’s destructibility\nis one of its greatest strengths, and this chaos really comes alive in Battle\nRoyale.\n\n## Fortnite Battle Royale Guide – Stay calm\n\nFortnite Battle Royale and PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds remain some of the\nmost anxiety-inducing experiences in the medium. Every second is a desperate\nfight for survival, so it’s easy to get caught up in the ramping tension. Try\nnot to let it get under your skin; stay focused on winning.\n\nIf possible, try to initiate fights instead of running away from them. Other\nplayers are likely to be just as scared as you, so taking the lead with a bit\nof ruthless aggression can pay off. A few well-placed bullets will spell doom\nfor anyone, so try not to be the one caught with their pants down.\n\nThat being said, marching into firefights without a plan of action is equally\nreckless. Make sure you’re properly stocked and ready to improvise if things\ndon’t go to plan.\n\n**Related:[Best PSVR Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nplaystation-vr-games)**\n\n![Fortnite Battle\nRoyale](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n* * *\n\n**Related Stories:**\n\n[**PUBG latest news**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/pubg-news-maps-\nupdate-3400825)\n\n**[Fortnite Battle Royale vs PUBG](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/pubg-v-\nfortnite-battle-royale-3383394)**\n\n[**Cyberpunk\n2077**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/cyberpunk-2077-release-date-\ngameplay-2948412)\n\n* * *\n\n_**What tips would you give someone on Fortnite: Battle Royale?
