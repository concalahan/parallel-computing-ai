But despite the rampant success of Dark Souls\non PC, Sony owns the rights to Bloodborne, meaning the legions of Dark Souls\nfans that only own a PC are unlikely to see if show up on the steam\nmarketplace.\n\nOur former games editor Sam gave\n[Bloodborne](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/bloodborne) a 9./10 and\nit’s become an instant classic, sharing a nightmarish tone, brutal combat and\nalien lore with Dark Souls, but with a more aggressive combat style that\nprioritises constant pressure. It’s quite unique, and honestly worth a go if\nyou haven’t played it before.\n\n**Related:[Best PC Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-pc-\ngames-3520096)**\n\nSo, to the rescue comes PlayStation Now, Sony’s premium streaming service that\nallows subscribers to play a library of PlayStation titles on their PS4 or PC.\nRight now, you can get a free seven-day trial of the service, and there’s a\n[promotion](https://blog.us.playstation.com/2018/06/05/playstation-now-\nstreaming-library-hits-650-games-summer-deals-revealed/) that means new\nsubscribers can sign up cheap.\n\nA couple of caveats. While I haven’t experienced it myself in my limited\nexperience with PlayStation Now, there are complaints of input lag and latency\nissues, especially if you’re not currently on a wired connection to the\ninternet. Your mileage may vary though, and you could absolutely test that out\nduring a free trial if Bloodborne for PC is what you desire.\n\nIt’s not just Bloodborne, either. The service also offers the only way to play\nthe original [God of War](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/god-of-war-\niii) trilogy, [Red Dead\nRedemption](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/red-dead-redemption) and\n[The Last of Us](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/the-last-of-us) on PC.\nThe kicker is that the app for the service doesn’t support a mouse and\nkeyboard, nor third-party controllers. If you want to play PlayStation games\non your PC, you’ll need to fork out for a DUALSHOCK4 to play them with.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nLife is hard.\n\n**Going to get your Bloodborne on?
