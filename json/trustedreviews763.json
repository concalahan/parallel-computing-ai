Our guide reveals all.\n\n## Essential Phone Release Date – when does the PH-1 come out in the UK and\nUS?\n\nFirst announced in May, the Essential Phone was expected it to start shipping\nreserved units “within 30 days”. Well, more than two months later the phone\nstill hadn’t arrived. In mid-August, we learned the phone would begin shipping\nwithin seven days via an email sent to US customers who pre-registered for the\nphone. However, that email stated that only the ‘Black Moon’ colour option\nwould be sent out at that stage.\n\nThat means those who pre-registered should start seeing their phones arrive\nafter August 23, but Essential has not yet announced an official release date\nat this point. The company is holding a ‘First Look’ event in LA on Friday,\nAugust 25, however, so we may well get a definitive answer then.\n\nIf you’re in the US you can reserve one right away via the link below, but the\nUK, Europe, and other regions are in a holding pattern, with the Essential\nwebsite noting that “we are shipping to the US only at this time”.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [

as well as western\nEurope and Japan, though a date is yet to be confirmed.\n\n## Essential Phone Price – How much does the PH-1 cost in the UK and US?\n\nThe Essential Phone is only available in one model – an unlocked one with\n128GB of on-board storage – which costs $699.\n\nThat equates to roughly £545 before VAT, though given the current economic\nclimate, we’d be surprised if the Essential Phone retailed SIM-free for less\nthan £599 in the UK, when it launches.\n\nUS buyers can also take advantage of a limited time bundle, which throws in a\n360-degree Essential Phone camera for an extra $50 (~£40) – a significant\nsaving, given the add-on’s regular price tag is $199 (~£155).\n\n**Related:[Best Android

5.7-inch QHD display that goes\neven further than the [Galaxy S8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-\ngalaxy-s8-review)‘s screen, and a modular design.\n\nYes, the Essential Phone is betting on modular functionality, following some\nhigh-profile failures in that space (LG’s G5 didn’t quite have the impact the\ncompany hoped).\n\nThe new phone brings with it a couple of **accessories** that can be attached\nto the handset via a magnetic connector and wireless data transfer.\n\n**Related:[Essential Home](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/essential-home-\nrelease-date-price-specs-features-latest-news-uk)**\n\n![Essential\nPhone](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThose accessories inclue the previously mentioned 360-degree camera that\nattaches to the top of the phone via the pogo pins, with the company said to\nbe working on a charging dock set to launch in the future.\n\nAll of which is great, but when it comes to the standard stuff, such as\nhardware and design, the Essential Phone seems to be a serious contender in\nthe smartphone market.\n\nFirst up, the handset comes with a **titanium and ceramic build** which will\napparently hold up better during drops than handsets from the big\nmanufacturers – at least, according to Andy Rubin.\n\nThe **edge-to-edge display** leaves minimal bezels on the side and top of the\nphone’s front, with a small bezel at the bottom and a cutout for the front\nfacing camera at the top.\n\n**Related:[iPhone 8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-8-release-\ndate-specs-rumours-price-uk)**\n\n![Essential\nPhone](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThat means the screen takes up more room on the front of the phone than on\nboth the [LG G6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/lg-g6-review) and the Galaxy\nS8.\n\nAccording to the report, the software will adapt itself around the front-\nfacing camera cutout, never showing notification icons on that part of the\nscreen.\n\nRound the back, you’ll find a **dual-camera setup** that uses two 13-megapixel\nsensors where the second lens is used as a monochrome sensor – the same thing\nfound on Huawei’s P9 and\n[P10](https://www.trustedreviews.com/huawei-p10-review).\n\n**Related:[Best smartphone](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-\nsmartphone_round-up)**\n\nThat monochrome sensor takes in more light than a traditional option, and\ncombines with the 13-megapixel standard sensor to improve low-light\nperformance.\n\nThe front-facing shooter is a modest 8-megapixel offering, but on the plus\nside, it is apparently capable of shooting **4K video**.\n\nSoftware is, as you’d expect, Android – the device is set to ship with\n[Android 7.0 Nougat](https://www.trustedreviews.com/android-7-0-nougat-review)\nand will presumably be upgraded to [Android\nO](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/android-o-8-features-preview-name-\nrumours-release-date-news-download-beta) further down the line.\n\n**Related:[Galaxy Note 8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-\nnote-8-release-date-specs-rumours-price-uk)**\n\n![Essential\nPhone](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nInternally, the company has packed the phone with the latest **Qualcomm 835\nprocessor, 4GB of RAM** , and **128GB of storage** – so it should be plenty\nfast and able to compete with the big phones of 2017.\n\nAnd in what could be seen as a somewhat controversial move, Essential has\nopted to follow Apple and leave out the 3.5mm jack – though an adapter is said\nto be included with the phone.\n\n**Let us know what you think of the Essential Phone on social media.**\n\n"}
