Despite sitting either sideof the Surface Pro 6’s 12.3-inch display size, both new iPad Pros are smaller,thinner and lighter. You don’t benefit from the Surface Pro 6’s integratedkickstand but the thin (recycled) aluminium unibody tablets should be easyenough to wield without one.## 2018 iPad Pro vs Surface Pro 6 – Which is the more powerful slate?Not only are these iPads lighter and thinner than the Surface Pro 6 but basedon Apple’s claims they’re apparently more powerful too. The enhanced AppleA12X Bionic chip supposedly offers enough oomph to trump 92% of the laptopsand similarly-classed machines out there right now, even those using 8th-generation Intel chips like the Surface Pro 6.**Related:[Intel Whiskey Lake and AmberLake](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/intel-whiskey-lake-amber-lake-3515645)**Unlike Apple’s approach, where price only affects storage and connectivity,for Microsoft’s machine, colour, memory and processor can all be altered for alittle more cash. The Pro 6 comes with either an 8th-generation Intel Core i5or i7 direct from Microsoft, with 8GB or 16GB of RAM allocated to each,respectively.All the devices in this roundup can offer up to 1TB of internal flash storage,however, at the other end of the scale Apple’s offerings start out with just64GB of space, while Microsoft’s Surface begins at 128GB.Both company’s devices rock LCD panels, although Apple has used the sametricks it pulled on the [iPhoneXR](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xr) (pixel masking and anti-aliasing) to give its latest iPad’s displays rounded corners, making bothslates look decidedly more cutting-edge against the Surface. Apple’s variousdisplay technologies, such as ProMotion (a 120Hz refresh rate for super-smoothvisuals), TrueTone (Apple tech which adjusts screen colour temperature basedon surrounding ambient light) HDR playback support all up the visual fidelityof these iPads far beyond anything Microsoft’s machine can muster.The iPads offer higher resolution front and rear cameras and ditch thephysical home button of their predecessor, instead integrating [FaceID](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/face-id-3286453) as first introducedon last year’s [iPhone X](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-x).The advanced face unlock technology at play has been reworked to function inany orientation and unlike the company’s phones, doesn’t sit within a notchthis time around. Despite this, the iPads offer slimmer bezels than theSurface, whose Windows Hello-compatible face unlock authentication is muchsimpler and arguably less secure.| **iPad Pro 11-inch** | **iPad Pro 12.9-inch** | **Surface Pro 6**  ---|---|---|---  **Dimensions** |  247.6 x 178.5 x 5.9mm | 280.6 x 214.9 x 5.9mm | 292 x 201 x8.5mm  **Weight** |  468g | 631g (WiFi)/633g (cellular) | 770g (i5)/784g (i7)  **Display** |  11-inch 4:3 (2388 x 1668) Liquid Retina LCD w/ ProMotion(120Hz), DCI-P3, True Tone, HDR10, Dolby Vision | 12.9-inch 4:3 (2732 x 2048)Liquid Retina LCD w/ ProMotion (120Hz), DCI-P3, True Tone, HDR10, Dolby Vision| 12.3-inch 3:2 (2736 x 1824) PixelSense LCD  **Processor** |  Apple A12X Bionic | Apple A12X Bionic | 8th-gen Intel Corei5/i7  **RAM** |  TBC | TBC | 8GB/16GB  **Rear camera** |  12-megapixels | 12-megapixels | 8-megapixels  **Front camera** |  7-megapixels | 7-megapixels | 5-megapixels  **Battery** |  29.3Wh (up to 10 hours of local video playback | 36.71Wh (up to10 hours of local video playback | 13.5 hours (of local video playback)  **Software** |  iOS 12.1 | iOS 12.1 | Windows 10  **Storage** |  64GB/256GB/512GB/1TB | 64GB/256GB/512GB/1TB |128GB/256GB/512GB/1TB  **Stylus** |  Apple Pencil 2 (sold separately) | Apple Pencil 2 (soldseparately) | Surface Pen (sold separately)  **Colours** |  Space Grey, Silver | Space Grey, Silver | Platinum, Black    Software is where the Surface may well claw back credibility in this face off.Apple’s new iPads, like any of the company’s mobile devices, run on iOS(version 12.1) and as such rely on the App Store for their applications. Youget a more refined experience from Apple’s operating system and the apps thatrun on it – all optimised for these tablet’s dimensions and specific hardwarebut compared to the versatility of full Windows as a platform found running onthe Surface Pro 6, it’s hard to compete.Microsoft’s Windows 10 still needs work when it comes to touch interaction butits infinitely more open as a platform and it more readily accommodatesmultitasking and other power-user functions.## 2018 iPad Pro vs Surface Pro 6 – Which offers the best value for money?The WiFi-only 11-inch iPad Pro starts at $799/£769, while the base 12.9-inchmodel starts at $999/£969. Microsoft’s Surface Pro 6 technically starts at$749, however, that price relates to a model that relies on a 7th-generationIntel Core m3 processor and that Microsoft doesn’t even advertise on its ownwebsite (not to mention it’ll likely feel underpowered, paired with just 4GBof RAM). For the base Core i5 Surface Pro 6 that Microsoft sells directly,expect to pay $899/£879.If your wallet is bursting at the seams, the top-spec 1TB 12.9-inch 2018 iPadPro with cellular will set you back a hefty $1899/£1869, while the Core i7Surface Pro 6 with 1TB of storage and 16GB of RAM will cost you a whopping$2299/£2149.The Microsoft Surface Pro 6 arrived in mid-October 2018, while the new 11 and12.9-inch 2018 iPad Pros are available to pre-order from today and hit storesin markets including the US and UK from November 7.**Apple’s new iPad Pro sports a wholly different focus to the MicrosoftSurface Pro 6, so does that make it better?
