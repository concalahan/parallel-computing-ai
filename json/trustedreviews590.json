It isn't a huge step\nforward in terms of raw gameplay, but the sheer amount of stuff to do will\nmean you keep coming back for more.\n\n## Pros\n\n  * Fantastic presentation\n  * UEFA licenses complete the package\n  * Small tweaks benefit the gameplay\n  * So much to do\n\n## Cons\n\n  * Not a huge upgrade\n  * Lack of career mode updates\n\n## Key Features\n\n  * Review Price: £49.99\n  * Platforms: PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PS3, Xbox 360, PC\n  * Genre: Sports\n  * Release Date: Out Now\n  * Developer: Electronic Arts\n\nThere are a few things that are oh-so-predictable with every new season of\nfootball: Tottenham bottling it at some point; Newcastle parking the bus\nagainst every top-six side; and Mourinho moaning about his transfer kitty. Oh,\nand a new version of FIFA on pretty much every format possible.\n\nFIFA 19 is a worthy successor to the generally excellent FIFA 18 for a number\nof reasons, but none of them are really in terms of gameplay. Yes, there are\nsome nice tweaks here, and it does feel smoother and more fluid to play.\nHowever, the big upgrades come in the form of _even_ more game modes and\n_even_ more licenses.\n\n**Related:[Best PS4\nGames](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/ps4-games-3431751)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nHowever, what I care about most with regards to a football game is how it\nfeels to play. This year, EA Sports has worked on a few specific areas, and to\ngive the developer credit, each of the changes makes a noticeable difference\nto the flow of the game. The most notable new feature is the ‘Active Touch\nSystem’, which basically means that on the pitch gameplay feels far more\nnatural.\n\nWhen the ball is coming towards you, it’s now possible to flick the right\nstick to either bring the ball down with greater control than ever before, or\nchip it up slightly to set yourself up for an audacious volley. How successful\nyou are at this largely depends on the quality of the player. So, if you’re\ncontrolling, say, Mahrez or Eden Hazard, then you’ll be able to comfortably\nbring the ball down on your thigh and continue running forward. Try it with\nWes Morgan and the ball will likely end up rolling away.\n\nAlongside providing an opportunity to begin a decent attack quickly, these new\nanimations just look far more realistic.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Fortnite Guide: How to Complete the Fortnitemares Challenges\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/fortnite-guide-complete-fortnitemares-\nchallenges-3610226 \"Fortnite Guide: How to Complete the Fortnitemares\nChallenges\")\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Google Assistant’s new Roomba trick could allow Google map your home\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-assistant-irobot-roomba-3613603\n\"Google Assistant’s new Roomba trick could allow Google map your home\")\n\n  *   * [ ![uncharted lost legacy](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Best PS4 Games 2018: All the top titles that belong in your library\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-ps4-games-3431751 \"Best PS4 Games\n2018: All the top titles that belong in your library\")\n\n  * \n\nAlso implemented this year is a greater focus on 50/50 challenges and battles.\nLike the Active Touch System, this adds a realistic layer to the game rather\nthan redefining how you play. There’s much more physicality when you’re\nbattling for position, and you have greater control over retrieving the ball –\neven if it was your mistake in the first place.\n\nEverything feels less pre-determined than in did in previous versions of the\ngame – and now, with the right player – I’m looking at you, N’Golo Kante – you\ncan wrestle the ball back in situations I’d just have given up in with FIFA\n18.\n\n**Related:[Best Xbox One Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/xbox-one-\ngames-3435271)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAfter plunging far too many hours into [PES\n2019](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/pes-2019), jumping back into\nFIFA’s frenetic pace proved initially jarring. There’s no doubt FIFA 19 lacks\na focus on build-up play, which makes its Konami-made rival so good.\nNevertheless, this is still a very good game of fast-paced football here.\n\nThe biggest changes to FIFA 19 aren’t in the way that it plays, however. It’s\nthings you can do in the game – and in this area, it firmly has PES 2019 beat.\n\nFIFA 19 is stacked with game modes, customisation options and things to do.\nThe once ignored basic Kick-off mode has been given a facelift with options to\ntrack your victories against a mate offline, and the ability to tweak your\ngame by turning off cards or having a player sent off every time you score a\ngoal. These are welcome touches that add a party-game feel to proceedings.\nYou’re probably not going to play it each time you boot up the game, but it’s\nideal if you’re playing with someone who isn’t a die-hard FIFA fan.\n\nAnother touch I really like is the ability to play a Kick-off game as a cup\nfinal, semi-final or even a group-stage tie. This adds a real intensity to\nfriendlies and, considering such care has gone into the presentation of these\nmarquee matches, it’s great to be able to constantly replay them.\n\nEA Sports has probably made such additions because it wants as much focus as\npossible on its biggest signing this year – official licenses for the UEFA\nChampions League, Europa League and Super Cup. Plucked from Konami, this has\nbeen the only big license missing from FIFA’s arsenal.\n\nIn typical fashion, these new licenses are handled with the utmost quality.\nEverything from the ball to the anthemic\n“[CHAAAMMMMMPIOOOOOOOOONNSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgomX3qD-iA)”\nmusic, to the specific advertising hoarding, has been reproduced in sublime\ndetail. There’s so much atmosphere packed into these matches that I almost\nwant to play them every time.\n\nThe Champions League licenses are baked into the Career mode, too, and here\nyou’ll see new graphics for the homescreen when a European week rolls around.\nSadly, that’s it for Career mode.\n\nActually, my only issue with the new UEFA licenses is the poor commentary\nprovided by the uninspiring duo of Derek Rae and former Arsenal stalwart Lee\nDixon. Rae – best known for commentating for NBCSN in the US – just doesn’t\nfeel natural here; there are many times that he hasn’t finished screaming the\nname of a player by the time the ball drifts away for a corner. Considering\nthe quality of the commentary in other modes, the shortcomings here stand out\nobviously.\n\n**Related:[Best Gaming Headset](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\ngaming-headsets-3431813)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nLike the gameplay, the visuals have received minor tweaks rather than\nwholesale changes. There’s more personality to those in the crowds and you’ll\nsee them waving crested flags or taking selfies, while player faces have\nslightly more detail and movement. Lighting in the accurately represented\nstadiums looks fantastic when playing in HDR, but I have noticed some dropped-\nframes on a [PS4 Pro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/ps4-pro) when\nplaying in arenas that are particularly detailed in rainy situations.\n\nThere are two other significant aspects of FIFA 19 that I haven’t touched upon\nyet: the final chapter in the story-driven ‘The Journey’ campaign, and the\nuber-addictive Ultimate Team.\n\nThe Journey surprised when it debuted a few years back with how good it was,\nand last year’s follow-up was equally engrossing (even if I felt it was a good\nway to end the series). For this final chapter EA Sports has used those new\nUEFA licenses to full effect. ‘The Journey: Champions’ continues Alex Hunter’s\njourney with a Champions League run, and it adds in a few more playable\ncharacters for variety.\n\nAlex is still the focus, and you can ignore the others completely if you wish,\nbut being able to switch between his half-sister Kim and friend Danny freshens\nup the formula.\n\nIt’s still trashy, cheesy, straight-to-DVD-quality writing and dialogue\nthroughout. Yet it’s fun to play and introduces some fun mini-games and\ndecisions to make. EA has really hit on something with this story, and it will\nbe interesting to see where it goes next.\n\nUltimate Team returns, obviously, and it will likely be the mode used most by\nhardcore fans. It’s very much the same as before and will likely eat away at\nyour wallet if you get really stuck in.\n\n## **Verdict**\n\nFIFA 19 is a great game, packed with plenty of detail. It isn’t a huge step\nforward in terms of raw gameplay, but the sheer amount of stuff to do will\nmean you keep coming back for more.\n\n## Score\n\n  \n\n"}
