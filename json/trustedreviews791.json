But its slightly atypical shiny design, lack of a\nheadphone jack and wealth of superfluous features left me concerned there\nwasn’t enough to entice buyers away from the stellar [Galaxy\nS8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-s8-review), or cheaper\n[OnePlus 5](https://www.trustedreviews.com/one-plus-5-review).\n\n**Related:[When will my phone get Android\nOreo?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/android-8-0-update-3293150)**\n\nAfter three months with the phone, though, I can’t help but hope I was wrong.\nWith long-term use the U11 has proven itself to be one of the best handsets\nI’ve tested this year, and has had a number of welcome upgrades that will\ndelight tech fans.\n\nAt a basic level this is because the phone’s continued to get all the basics\nright. Unlike the [Huawei\nP10](https://www.trustedreviews.com/huawei-p10-review) I was previously using,\nthe U11’s battery hasn’t deteriorated at all and still offers me the same day\nand a half of regular use that it did straight out of the box. Performance is\nalso as nippy as ever – a fact likely aided by the U11’s lack of bloatware.\n\n**Related:[Best HTC U11 deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/best-\nhtc-u11-deals-1)**\n\nThe U11’s software has actually improved since launch thanks to the addition\nof Amazon Alexa support. I’m not convinced Alexa is any smarter than Android’s\nbuilt-in Google Assistant, but the addition is a welcome one that made it easy\nfor me to shop on Amazon without having to launch the app and manually search\nfor items.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Call of Cthulhu](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Call of Cthulhu\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/call-of-cthulhu \"Call of Cthulhu\")\n\n  * [ ![iPad Pro 2018](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: MySmartPrice / @OnLeaks \n\n### New iPad Pro 2018 leak shows Apple is almost certainly dropping the Home\nbutton\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ipad-pro-2018-release-date-specs-\nprice-3482812 \"New iPad Pro 2018 leak shows Apple is almost certainly dropping\nthe Home button\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Pete Lau on stage at the OnePlus 6T launch](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### The OnePlus 6T ditched the headphone jack, CEO Pete Lau tells us why\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ceo-pete-lau-oneplus-6t-headphone-jack-\nwireless-charging-3612475 \"The OnePlus 6T ditched the headphone jack, CEO Pete\nLau tells us why\")\n\n  * \n\nThe feature also showcases one of the U11’s best, but most overlooked, selling\npoints: its microphones. The U11 has some of the best mics I’ve used on a\nphone, and they mean that Alexa is worryingly good at picking up voice\ncommands – a fact showcased when I nearly made an accidental and costly\n[Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Ti](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nvidia-\ngeforce-gtx-1080-ti) purchase when I inadvertently answered “yes” to a\nvisiting friend’s question while running a price check with Alexa.\n\nAlexa also made me finally properly take advantage of the U11’s previously\nbizarre “Edge Sense” squeeze controls. I currently have the phone set so a\nshort squeeze will launch Alexa while a long one will kickstart Google\nAssistant.\n\nThat’s not to say everything has been kittens and rainbows during my time with\nthe U11. The lack of a headphone jack is still an annoyance that’s kept me\nfrom using my favoured Fender FXA2 wired headphones, as the bundled USB-C\nadapter is insanely flimsy and easy to break. I’m already on adapter number\nthree after the connecter bent in my pocket on the walk to work.\n\nThe adapter is also fairly finicky to replace, as the U11 only accepts the\nofficial one being sold on HTC’s online store. Be warned, close to all of the\nthird-party USB-C adapters on Amazon will not work with the U11.\n\nStill, this is a small annoyance considering the HTC U11’s other perks, and\none that can easily be avoided with the use of wireless headphones (if you can\nput up with the audio quality downgrade that is). The other option is to use a\nproper [USB headphone amp](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nheadphone-amps) but that’s an expensive option that’s only worthwhile if\nyou’ve spent a decent amount on your cans.\n\n  * **Buy Now:[HTC U11 on Vodafone (16GB) £39/month, £44 upfront](https://www.awin1.com/pclick.php?p=21643327307&a=277673&m=3202&clickref=tr-mobiledeals-htcu11)**\n  * **Buy Now:[HTC U11 on Vodafone (32GB) £45/month, free upfront](https://www.awin1.com/pclick.php?p=21643327313&a=277673&m=3202&clickref=tr-mobiledeals-htcu11)**\n\n## What is the HTC U11?\n\nThe U11 is HTC’s answer to Samsung’s seemingly unconquerable [Galaxy\nS8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-s8-review \"Galaxy S8\nreview\"), which is _TrustedReviews_ ’ current smartphone of choice. In its bid\nto outdo the Galaxy, HTC has loaded the U11 with an arsenal of interesting\nfeatures.\n\nHighlights include Amazon Alexa support, Hi-Res Audio capabilities and a\nslightly bizarre set of “Edge Sense” squeeze controls – yes, you read that\nright. These, plus a wealth of cutting-edge components, make the phone a great\nchoice for any smartphone buyer willing to put up with its atypical, super-\nshiny looks.\n\n**Related:[Best smartphones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-\nsmartphone_round-up \"Best smartphones\")**\n\n## HTC U11 – Design\n\nThe U11 follows the same ‘Liquid Surface’ design as HTC’s previous [U\nPlay](https://www.trustedreviews.com/htc-u-play-review \"HTC U Play review\")\nand [U Ultra](https://www.trustedreviews.com/htc-u-ultra-review \"HTC U Ultra\nreview\") handsets. This replaces the unibody metal design for which HTC was\npreviously known with a new combination of metal and glass.\n\nPersonally, I wish that HTC had stuck with metal, but from a distance I’ll\nconcede that the design looks great. This is largely because HTC has managed\nto pull a canny trick, where the colour of the glass changes depending on teh\nangle from which you view it. For example, the silver version I tested\nswitches between hues of silver and blue, while the black takes on a greenish\ntint at certain angles.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection of the device you’ll realise there are a few\nproblems with the U11’s design. Unlike the Galaxy S8, which also features a\nmixed-material casing, the glass on the U11’s back is bolted onto – rather\nthan housed within – the metal frame. This small difference makes the phone\nfeel far more chunky, measuring in at 7.9mm thick – and, in my mind, slightly\nless luxurious.\n\nThis feeling isn’t helped by the fact that the back is an outright fingerprint\nmagnet. Within 10 seconds of it leaving the box, the rear was a criss-cross of\nmarks and smudges.\n\n![HTC U11](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe only other slight quibble I have with the design is that, by today’s\nstandards, the bezel is fairly chunky. A few years ago this may have been\nfine, but in comparison to other 2017 flagships – such as the [Galaxy\nS8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-s8-review \"Galaxy S8\nreview\") and [LG G6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/lg-g6-review \"LG G6\nreview\") – the giant black edge around the U11’s screen looks a little retro,\nand not in a good way.\n\nLike past U-series phones, the U11 doesn’t have a headphone jack. I understand\nthe argument that USB-C is the future, and HTC has managed to curtail the\nissues associated with not having a 3.5mm jack socket by including an adapter\nand a surprisingly good pair of in-ear USB-C “USonic” headphones.\nNevertheless, the socket’s absence is still an annoyance.  \n**  \n** Over the two weeks I’ve been using this phone, I’ve repeatedly been forced\nto forego the listening pleasure of my [Sennheiser Momentum\n2.0](https://www.trustedreviews.com/sennheiser-momentum-2-0-review \"Sennheiser\nMomentum 2.0 review\") and use the USonic – or my wireless [Jaybird\nFreedom](https://www.trustedreviews.com/jaybird-freedom-review \"Jaybird\nFreedom review\") gym headphones – on my commute because I’ve forgotten to pack\nthe adapter. Case in point: there isn’t a photo of the adapter in this review\nbecause I can’t for the life of me remember where I put it.\n\n![HTC U11](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nOutside of this, however, the design ticks most of the right boxes. The\nfingerprint scanner sits in the U11’s front home button and, while not quite\nas nippy as the Huawei P10 or P10 Plus’, it’s been consistently reliable when\nunlocking the phone.\n\nThe appearance of a microSD card slot is also welcome, although I can’t see\nanyone but power users needing it since the U11 already features either 64GB\n(tested) or 128GB of internal storage.\n\nThe fact that the U11 has been designed to meet IP67 certification standards\nwill be a boon for accident-prone users, and means the phone will be able to\nsurvive accidental submersions in liquid at depths of 1m and below for 30\nminutes. **  \n**\n\n## HTC U11 – Screen\n\nOutside of its slightly chunky bezel, the U11’s screen is top-notch. The\n5.5-inch panel’s quad-HD (2560 x 1440 pixels) resolution ensures text and\nicons are uniformly sharp; you’ll struggle to spot any individual pixels.\n\nThe Super LCD 5 panel also offers decent colour temperature, with none of the\nRGB spectrum looking too cool or too warm – although they don’t look quite as\nvibrant as competing phones with AMOLED panels.\n\n  * **Buy Now:[HTC U11 on Vodafone (16GB) £39/month, £44 upfront](https://www.awin1.com/pclick.php?p=21643327307&a=277673&m=3202&clickref=tr-mobiledeals-htcu11)**\n  * **Buy Now:[HTC U11 on Vodafone (32GB) £45/month, free upfront](https://www.awin1.com/pclick.php?p=21643327313&a=277673&m=3202&clickref=tr-mobiledeals-htcu11)**\n\n![ham 13](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nI didn’t notice any serious backlight bleed on the U11 during my first week of\nuse, either. My only slight issue is that the maximum brightness isn’t quite\nas high as that of the Galaxy S8. This isn’t a huge disaster, as 99% of the\ntime you won’t want the display maxed out. It only becomes an annoyance when\nusing the U11 outdoors in direct sunlight, or very bright indoor areas, where\nthe screen can become fairly reflective. Being fair to HTC, though, this is an\nissue I experience with the majority of phones I review.\n\n[ Next  \nSoftware and performance\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/htc-u11-software-and-performance-\npage-2)\n\n"}
