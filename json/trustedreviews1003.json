What you’relooking for is the glowing enemies, which look similar to the bog-standardskinny cube fiends but, as we said, glow.**Damage Cube Fragments 0/2500**Again, don’t let the number fool you. Just head from corrupted zone tocorrupted zone blasting or pickaxing the cube spikes. They take longer todestroy than your average enemy so if you can rope in a squad to help you outthis’ll get done much quicker.**Deal Damage to Cube Monsters in a single match 0/1000**Again, again, it’s not a massive amount. Two rockets into a group of fiendswill complete this challenge, as will several well-placed headshots with asniper or shotgun. If you can’t get it done at one zone, just head to anotherin the same match and the progress will carry over.**Visit Different Corrupted Areas in the single match 0/4**Right. Okay. Normally these challenges are a ballache, but, thanks to theintroduction of the quadcrasher, they’re now a cakewalk. Drop in Salty Springsand by the gas station is a trailer with quadcrashers on the back. Grab one,then head to the corrupted zone north of salty, then to the south, then headeast towards the zone by Paradise Palms. With just the one zone left, headnorth to the area by Wailing Woods to complete this challenge.Should you happen to run into any enemies, just use the quadcrasher’s boostability to zip away in a flash.**Destroy Cube Fragments 0/3**If you’re doing all the challenges in one go, this should double up with thedamage cube fragments challenge. As you can imagine, this is another fairlystraightforward affair. Head to a zone, smash the fragment and repeat two moretimes. That’s it.**Complete Fortnitemares Challenges 0/14**And to finish up everything, complete 14 of the Fortnitemares challenges. Part3 is full of easy challenges, as is Part 4. As for Part 1 and Part 2, you canignore the staged challenges that require you to complete several stages overdifferent matches and instead opt for anything to do with damage or kill.Chances are, however, by the time you have to think about this challenge,you’ll already have it completed.Reward – New GliderOnce you’ve got all of the above completed, maybe it’s time to revisit themain Battle Pass challenges?
