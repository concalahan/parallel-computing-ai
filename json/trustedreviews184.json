If you still\nhave hope then here’s what we know so far, including the expected Apple Car\nprice, release date, news, leaks, design, and whether it’s driverless and/or\nelectric.**\n\n**(Update: June 28, 2017):** _Apple has reportedly teamed up with rental car\nagency Hertz to test autonomous vehicle software. Read on to find out more._\n\nThe Apple Car is a tricky subject because we’re not even sure that it exists.\nNevertheless, few products have been rumoured as heavily – and debated so\nvociferously – as the Apple Car. Tesla CEO Elon Musk is already calling the\ncar a “missed opportunity” due to its far-off launch. There’s no denying that\nthe evidence of an Apple Car is mounting, and it seems Apple is struggling to\nkeep a lid on leaks.\n\nThe long-rumoured electric vehicle – supposedly developer under the codename\n‘Project Titan’ – is tipped for either a 2019 or 2020 launch. It’s also\nalleged that Apple is developing the vehicle in Berlin (in part, anyway), with\na team of between 15 and 20 “progressive thinkers” – so says the German media.\nThe Cupertino-based technology giant is also reportedly in talks with\nmanufacturers of charging stations for electric cars.\n\nIn any case, Apple has been invested in the vehicle space for a while. The\nApple CarPlay in-car ecosystem has been a long-standing part of Apple’s\nportfolio, and the company was recently awarded a patent that described how a\ncar could be controlled, in part, by an iPhone. So with the innards of a car\nalready cracked, Apple’s movement into vehicle manufacturing wouldn’t be a\nhuge surprise.\n\nThe actual design of the vehicle is still up for debate. Some say it will be a\ncar, others a minivan. Some say it will be driverless, others electric – maybe\nboth. Apple was recently reported to be interested in autonomous vehicle\ntesting facilities, which suggests that the former may certainly be true.\n\nWhat we do know is that Apple certainly has the resources to build an electric\ncar. Even a senior Ford exec admitted to _TrustedReviews_ that he thinks Apple\n“can do it”. After all, the company has a world-leading market capitalisation\nof $524 billion, and has over $200 billion cash in the bank. Tesla started\nwith far less.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n###  Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nBut is there any evidence to suggest that Apple is building an Apple Car? And\nif such a vehicle exists, what will it look like?\n\n**Ford on Apple’s and Google’s self-driving cars:**\n\n## In Brief\n\n**When is the Apple Car coming out?** _2020 (rumoured)_  \n **What can we expect?** _Electric minivan, possibly driverless_  \n **How much will the Apple Car cost?** _$55,000 estimate_\n\n**Related:[Apple Car: The biggest challenges Apple\nfaces](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/apple-car-features)**\n\n## Apple Car leaks and proof – Is there any Apple Car evidence?\n\nVague concepts of an “iCar” have been spun for an age, but we’re all about\nhard evidence here at _TrustedReviews_. To that end, we’ve rounded up all the\napparent “proof” for the existence of an Apple Car.\n\n_This section is in chronological order._\n\n## Apple Car News: 2015\n\n__**Silicon Valley speculation**\n\nOn 12 February 2015, Bryan Chaffin, co-founder of The Mac Observer, told\nBusiness Insider that [he is “certain” Apple is working on an electric\nvehicle](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-building-a-car-with-\npoached-tesla-staff-says-report). Chaffin said:\n\n“What I learned is that Apple has been looking for – and acquiring – the kind\nof people from Tesla with expertise that is most suited to cars. So much so\nthat I went from being a doubter to a believer almost instantly. From another\nsource who travels in more rarified circles than yours truly, I also learned\nthat a lot of people at the top in Silicon Valley consider it a given that\nApple is working on a car.”\n\n![Apple Car\n25](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)The Tesla Model S\n\nHe then added that he was close “to 100%” certain that Apple was attempting to\nbuild a car for the consumer market.\n\n**Tim Cook’s mini-van**\n\nOn 13 February 2015, the Wall Street Journal noted the existence of [a project\n“Titan”, green-lit by Apple CEO Tim Cook](http://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-\ntitan-car-project-to-challenge-tesla-1423868072?alg=y). The project was\nreported to entail an electric vehicle “that resembles a minivan”.\n\n![Apple Car\n21](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)Concept render (via re/code)\n\nAt the time, it was claimed that Apple was still in the vehicle design stage.\nThe piece read:\n\n“The size of the project team and the senior people involved indicate that the\ncompany is serious. Apple executives have flown to Austria to meet with\ncontract manufacturers for high-end cars, including the Magna Steyr unit of\nCanadian auto supplier Magna International Inc.”\n\nThe WSJ went on to say that Apple “hopes to put its stamp on the electric\nvehicle market in the same way it did the smartphone with its iPhone”, and\nthat the firm had given the go ahead for the creation of a 1,000-person team,\nand permitted poaching from different parts of the company.\n\n**Five years and counting**\n\nOn 20 February 2015, a Bloomberg report alleged that [Apple was definitely\nplanning to enter the car market](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-\ncar-to-enter-production-by-2020-report-claims). The article claimed that the\ncompany was working to a five-year time frame, which would put the release in\nthe year 2020.\n\n**Manufacturing at the Sunnyvale Campus**\n\nOn 13 March 2015, AppleInsider published an extensive report detailing the\n[location Apple may be using to develop the Apple\nCar](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-project-titan-car-research-\ntipped-at-sunnyvale-campus).\n\nThe article cited “two people familiar with knowledge of the project”,\nsuggesting that Apple is making use of its leased Sunnyvale, California campus\nto build the car.\n\n![Apple Car\n23](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)The Sunnyvale campus (via AppleInsider)\n\nThe website writes:\n\n“According to one AppleInsider source familiar with ‘Titan’, many of Apple’s\nnew auto-related hires, including recruits from Tesla, have been working out\nof the Sunnyvale campus. This person claims that some of the projects underway\nhave been kept ‘very secret within the company’.”\n\n**Secret shell company**\n\nBut Apple couldn’t openly develop a car right in front of everyone’s eyes,\ncould it? Well that same AppleInsider report makes mention of a company\n“SixtyEight Research”, which it suggested may be a shell company being used by\nApple to work on the car.\n\nAccording to the company website, SixtyEight Research is a self-proclaimed\n“innovative company” that’s “redefining market research”. It’s based at the\nSunnyvale campus. What’s particularly interesting about SixtyEight Research is\nthat it has almost no presence online, and no-one really knows what the\ncompany actually does. The report explains:\n\n“SixtyEight’s affiliation could not be confirmed, but Apple does have a long\nhistory of using shell corporations and deceptive methods to hide its secret\nprojects. Aside from a barren website, there is scant other information about\nSixtyEight – lending more credence to its use as a front. It wouldn’t be a\nstretch to surmise that SixtyEight could play a role in allowing Apple to\npurchase and import automotive equipment and tools without drawing any\nsuspicion.”\n\n![Apple Car\n9](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)Concept renders (via\n[CarWow](https://www.carwow.co.uk/blog/Apple-car-imagined-by-carwow))\n\nThe article also details how employees approach the site with Apple badges\nthat have been “scrubbed” of the official Apple branding. What’s more, certain\nbuildings on the site have been given permits for automotive work and repair\nareas. Unfortunately, we still don’t know exactly what Apple is cooking up at\nthe Sunnyvale Campus, and the company has declined to provide official comment\non the matter.\n\n**Related:[Apple CarPlay vs Android\nAuto](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/apple-carplay-vs-android-auto)**\n\n**“Ultimate mobile device”**\n\nOn 27 May 2015, [Jeff Williams, SVP of Operations at Apple, dropped a huge\nhint](http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/27/apple-products-car-\nidUSL1N0YI1OM20150527) that the company may be eyeing the automotive industry.\n\nWhen quizzed about Apple’s oft-rumoured interest in building an electric car,\nWilliams responded: “The car is the ultimate mobile device.” He also said that\nApple is “exploring a lot of different markets”, and that the company hopes to\nenter industries “where we think we can make a huge amount of difference”.\n\n**Meetings with BMW**\n\nOn 1 August 2015, a Reuters article noted that several senior [Apple employees\nhad made a number of visits to BMW\nfacilities](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-met-with-bmw-to-learn-\nabout-making-cars-says-report) over the past year.\n\nThe report cited “two sources familiar” with the matter, and revealed that\nApple CEO Tim Cook visited BMW’s headquarters in 2015. It also claimed that\n“senior Apple executives” toured BMW’s Leipzig factory to “learn how it\nmanufactures the i3 electric car”.\n\n![Apple Car\n5](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)BMW’s Leipzig plant\n\n“The dialogue ended without conclusion, because Apple appears to want to\nexplore developing a passenger car on its own,” the report explains, and\nsuggests that BMW was “cautious” about sharing “manufacturing know-how” with\nApple because it doesn’t want to end up as a “mere supplier”.\n\nApple executives reportedly probed BMW board members on tooling, production\nand parts licensing. A senior BMW source was quoted as saying: “Apple\nexecutives were impressed with the fact that we abandoned traditional\napproaches to car-making and started afresh. It chimed with the way they do\nthings too.”\n\n**Searching for a test facility**\n\nOn 14 August 2015, The Guardian detailed an apparent attempt by Apple to\nsecure a [testing facility for the Apple\nCar](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/report-confirms-apple-is-building-a-\nself-driving-car). The publication obtained documents that proved\ncorrespondence between Apple and a potential test site. The report claimed\nthat Apple had scouted a 2,100-acre former Naval base – 40 miles from Silicon\nValley – which is now a facility for testing driverless cars.\n\nAccording to the report, Apple’s Special Projects team visited the GoMentum\nStation in May, with talks still ongoing. In one correspondence, Apple\nengineer Frank Fearon is alleged to have written:\n\n“We would…like to get an understanding of timing and availability for the\nspace, and how we would need to coordinate around other parties who will be\nusing [it].”\n\n![Apple Car\n13](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)The GoMentum Station\n\nJack Hall, GoMentum Station program manager, reportedly responded:\n\n“We would still like to meet in order to keep everything moving and to meet\nyour testing schedule.”\n\nThe station – which has been used by both Mercedes-Benz and Honda for\nautonomous vehicle testing – is currently bound to a non-disclosure agreement\nwith Apple regarding discussions.\n\n**Meetings with California’s motor department**\n\nOn 18 September 2015, The Guardian released another report that suggested\n[Apple executives have “discussed their plans” for a self-driving\ncar](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/report-apple-met-california-s-motor-\ndepartment-to-discuss-autonomous-car) with California’s Department of Motor\nVehicles.\n\nThe article – based on documents related to the matter – revealed that Mike\nMaletic, a senior legal counsel at Apple – had an “hour-long meeting” with\nBernard Soriano, DMV deputy director, and Stephanie Dougherty, chief of\nstrategic planning, on 17 August. These individuals are the DMV’s self-driving\ncar experts, and co-sponsors of California’s autonomous vehicle regulation\nproject. Also alleged to have attended the meeting is Brian Soublet, deputy\ndirector and chief counsel of the DMV.\n\nAccording to the report, the DMV didn’t disclose the details of what was\ndiscussed at the meeting, only stating: “The Apple meeting was to review [the]\nDMV’s autonomous vehicle regulations.”\n\n![Apple Car\n7](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)California’s Department of Motor Vehicles\n\nWe already know that California’s DMV is currently working on regulations to\ncontrol the eventual public rollout of self-driving vehicles. If Apple is\nplotting an electric vehicle, it will need to adhere to these regulations to\noperate on Californian roads.\n\n**“Accelerating efforts”**\n\nOn 21 September 21 2015, the Wall Street Journal claimed that [Apple was\nscaling up its “Project Titan”\noperations](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/the-first-apple-car-is-less-\nthan-five-years-away-wsj-claims). According to the report, Apple is tripling\nits 600-strong workforce at its secret automotive facility.\n\nIt’s alleged that the company has a planned shipment date of 2019, and that\nApple is “accelerating efforts” to meet its deadline.\n\n**“Massive change”**\n\nOn 19 October 2015, Apple CEO [Tim Cook spoke out about the automotive\nindustry](http://www.wsj.com/video/tim-cook-talks-at-wsjdlive-about-the-\nfuture-of-cars/65732065-D80B-4A28-B0A1-AC4240FAB7DA.html). Speaking at the\nWSJDLive conference in California, Cook said:\n\n“It would seem like there will be massive change in that industry, massive\nchange. You may not agree with that. That’s what I think.”\n\n![Apple Car\n27](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)Tim Cook at WSJDLive\n\nUnfortunately, Cook stopped short of saying whether Apple would be directly\ninvolved with this change. And of course, much of the speculation about the\nApple Car is based on employees hired by Apple, which we’ll detail in the next\nsection.\n\n**Faraday Future**\n\nOn 6 November 2015, the New York Post published a profile of [a mysterious\nelectric car company called Faraday\nFuture](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/is-this-mysterious-electric-car-\ncompany-a-front-for-apple).\n\nThe Californian firm, which began its operations in 2015, is currently\nbuilding a “billion-dollar manufacturing plant” and “poaching the best minds\nin the auto world”, according to the report. The Post notes that the company\nacquired its funding in a peculiarly short space of time. What’s more, the\ncompany currently has upwards of 400 employees, and aims to increase that to\n500 by the end of the year. That’s impressive scaling for a year-old company\nwith no existing products to its name.\n\nFaraday Future is also keeping the identity of its CEO quiet. Instead, Nick\nSampson, former director of vehicle and chassis engineering at Tesla, who now\nworks as Senior VP for the firm, handles public correspondence.\n\n“Producing our forward-looking and fully connected electric vehicles not only\nrequires the latest technology, but the right community partner,” says\nSampson, who has declined to reveal Faraday Future’s partners.\n\nThe Post suggests that Faraday Future may actually be a front for Apple, to\ndevelop its secret car project in plain sight. Sampson previously told\nreporters that the company was aiming to launch a brand-new electric car that\nwould rival the Tesla Model S. However, the company is aiming to launch the\nvehicle in 2017, two years earlier than Apple was rumoured to release its own\ncar.\n\nUnfortunately, there’s no concrete evidence that links Faraday Future to\nApple, so take this report with caution.\n\n**Related:[4 things we didn’t hear about during Apple’s September\nevent](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/apple-s-iphone-6s-looks-great-\nbut-where-s-the-car-and-os-x-el-capitan)**\n\n![Apple Car\n19](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg) The iMove, a concept render (via Liviu Tudoran)  \n **Cork, Ireland?**\n\nOn 16 December 2015, a report by Silicon Republic speculated on a possible\nploy by Apple to build the Apple Car in Ireland. The report noted a\nrecruitment drive by Apple, specifically targeting auto industry experts to\nwork at its plant in Cork.\n\nOne recent job post included a “Global Supplier Manager” position with\nexperience in the automotive industry. Another advertised for a “Procurement\nManager” with experience in “automotive design”. The job description explained\nthat Apple was seeking applicants who could “achieve most efficient costs for\nequipment while helping enable Apple’s unique design and testing\nrequirements”.\n\nTim Cook also recently took a trip to Ireland to meet with Apple employees,\npledging 1,000 new jobs for the Cork plant, which is currently staffed by a\n5,000-strong workforce. Of course, we can’t say for sure what Apple is\nplanning for the Cork plant until more evidence comes to light.\n\n(apester:569795558089e8dd05d295f8)\n\n## Apple Car News: 2016\n\n**Apple.car**\n\nOn January 8, 2016, it became apparent – courtesy of [a MacRumors\nreport](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-owns-apple-car-domain) –\nthat Apple had registered three car-related domains, hinting at the as yet\nunconfirmed Apple Car project.\n\nThe domains in question were:\n\n  * apple.car\n  * apple.cars\n  * apple.auto\n\nOf course, there’s no guarantee that these domain registrations mean Apple is\nworking on an automotive project. Companies often buy out – and sit on –\ndomains simply to prevent rival entities scooping them up ahead of time.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that the domains could be related to the Apple CarPlay\nconnectivity system, which is a publicly available product.\n\n**An open secret**\n\nOn January 12, 2016, Elon Musk, the man behind Tesla, SpaceX, and Paypal,\n[described](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/elon-musk-apple-car-obvious-\nand-an-open-secret) the Apple Car as “obvious”, and “an open secret”.\n\nMusk made the comments in an interview with the BBC, during which he revealed\nhe believes Apple would “probably make a compelling electic car”, and that “it\nseems like an obvious thing to do”. The Tesla boss also said that “it’s pretty\nhard to hide something if you hire a thousand engineers to do it”.\n\n**Exploring**\n\nOn February 22, 2016, Tim Cook spoke to\n[Fortune](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/tim-cook-on-apple-car-hiring-\nexperts-doesn-t-mean-we-re-committed) about the company’s explorations in the\nautomotive sector.\n\n“We don’t have to spend large amounts to explore. So I can’t talk about this\ncertain area that you’re talking about. But when we start spending large\namounts of money, we’re committed at that point. But we explore things with\nteams of people.”\n\nHe continued: “Part of exploring technologies and picking the right one is\nbecoming so familiar with it you can see ways that it can be used. And for us,\nwe’ve never been about being first. So we explore many different things, many\ndifferent technologies. And at first we might not know what product it might\nwind up in.”\n\n**Christmas Eve**\n\nOn February 26, 2016, Cook talked about prospects of an Apple Car yet again,\nthis time at Apple’s annual shareholder meeting, courtesy of\n[re/code](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/tim-cook-likens-wait-for-apple-\ncar-to-christmas-eve).\n\n“Do you remember when you were a kid and Christmas Eve was so exciting? You\nweren’t sure what was going on downstairs? Well, it’s going to be Christmas\nEve for a while.”\n\nNot so helpful, Tim.\n\n**Apple ist ein Berliner?**\n\nOn April 19, 2016, a period of quiet in Apple Car rumour-dom came to an end\nwith a report from a German newspaper claiming the vehicle was in development\nin Berlin. According to Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Apple [has\nemployed](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-car-in-development-at-\nsecret-lab-in-germany-report) between 15 and 20 automotive experts at a\n“secret lab” in the German capital.\n\n![berlin](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)Is Apple developing the Apple Car in Berlin?\n\nThe report cites the workers as having experience in engineering,\nmanufacturing, software, and sales, and describes them as “progressive\nthinkers”. The same article alleged that Apple is considering using Austrian-\nbased Magna Steyr – an automotive manufacturer – to build the Apple Car.\n\nMagna Steyr is a subsidiary of Magna International, and is headquartered in\nGraz, Austria. It was founded in 2001, and has around 10,500 employees. The\ncompany builds around 200,000 vehicles a year, and developed Mercedes-Benz’s\n‘4Matic’ four-wheel drive system. It also develops cars on behalf of\nmanufacturers like BMW, Audi, Fiat, Peugeot, and Aston Martin.\n\n**The search for land continues**\n\nOn May 6, 2016, the Wall Street Journal claimed Apple was eyeing up a huge\nproperty in California to test out its secretive driverless Apple Car project.\n\nThe report cited a “top landlord” in the area – Victor Coleman, CEO of Hudson\nPacific Properties – who reportedly said:\n\n“We’re seeing the Toyotas of the world, the Teslas of the world, BMWs,\nMercedes. Ford now is out in the marketplace looking for space. I haven’t even\nmentioned the 400,000 square feet that Google’s looking to take down and the\n800,000 square feet that Apple’s looking to take down for their autonomous\ncars as well.”\n\nHudson Pacific is a major landlord in the San Francisco Bay Area, and already\nrents properties to tech giants like Uber and Square. According to the WSJ,\nColeman described driverless vehicle testing facilities as a “hot demand\nitem”, and said that there is a “definitive movement” from Silicon Valley\ncompanies in the space.\n\n**A digital car key?**\n\nOn May 24, 2016, it was revealed that the US Patent and Trademark office had\nawarded a patent that allowed a vehicle to be controlled using a portable\ndevice, like an iPhone or iPad. The patent describes how the device could\nunlock the car doors or even start the engine, and also allows for multiple\ndevices to control the car at any one time. Here are some of the operations\nApple reveals the iPhone could perform:\n\n  * Unlocking the doors\n  * Starting the engine\n  * Activating the audio or audiovisual entertainment system\n  * Activating GPS\n  * Activating the dashboard console\n  * Turn on passenger lighting\n  * Adjust seats\n  * Turn on headlights\n  * Open the sun roof\n  * Turn on windshield wipers\n  * Activate automatic parking\n  * Activate wireless communications\n\nThis is, of course, not necessarily evidence of an Apple Car. However, it does\nsignal Apple’s continued efforts in the vehicle space, and shows that Apple\nhas plenty to offer in terms of innovation. Getting third-party car\nmanufacturers to sign up to this wide-reaching ecosystem will surely be on\nApple’s agenda, although an Apple Car would likely debut with all of this\ntechnology built in anyway.\n\n**Making a charge for EVs**\n\nOn May 25, 2016, an exclusive Reuters\n[report](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/here-s-the-latest-evidence-apple-\nmaking-a-charge-at-electric-cars) claimed that Apple has been speaking to\nmanufacturers of charging stations for electric cars. The report claims Apple\nhas hired at least four engineers in the field based on a review of LinkedIn\nprofiles. However, the report says that the companies approached by Apple are\nreluctant to share knowledge with a potential competitor.\n\nThe sources cited in the report were unclear about whether Apple hoped to\nbuild its own charging stations, or simply engineer compatibility with\nexisting systems. Apple declined to comment on the story, but the president of\nNRG Energy’s EVgo charging business said he was “in discussions with every\nmanufacturer of today and every potential manufacturer of tomorrow”. That’s\nnot exactly a denial, is it?\n\nSpeaking to Reuters, an anonymous source said: “It would be natural to assume\nif Apple is going to have a fully battery electric vehicle that creates a\nseamless consumer experience the way Apple does, the charging infrastructure\nand its availability would be of paramount importance.”\n\n**Canadian suppliers**\n\nOn June 16, 2016, Bloomberg reported on possible evidence of Apple’s interest\nin the automotive sector. According to the article, Canadian auto-parts maker\nLinamar Corp. has talked with both Apple and Google about potentially\nsupplying vehicle components. During an interview in Toronto, CEO Linda\nHasenfratz decline to go into detail on the matter, but said:\n\n“They’re interested in partnering with people in the industry as well because\nobviously we’ve got the experience and we know what we need to do in order to\nbuild a high-quality vehicle. We’re quoting work and designing products that\ncould be utilised in those vehicles.”\n\nApple didn’t immediately respond to Bloomberg’s request for comment, so we\nshould take this report with due caution for now.\n\n**Formula 1 acquisition?**\n\nOn July 13, 2016, Formula 1 blogger Joe Saward suggested that Apple may be\ninvolved in purchasing the Formula 1.\n\nApple hasn’t really got a history of high-profile acquisitions, usually opting\nto snap up smaller companies and integrate them into the firm’s existing\nstructure. An F1 buy would be a different proposition altogether, but it’s\nactually not that crazy. For one, it’s no secret that Formula 1 is up for sale\n– the group has been publicly looking for a buyer since 2015, with supremo\nBernie Ecclestone saying he’s ‘ready’ to sell the financially struggling\nseries.\n\n![formula\n1](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)Formula 1: Apple’s next buyout?\n\nThere’s even been a price attached to the wildly popular racing championship:\n$8.5 billion (around £6 billion). It was previously thought that the buyer\nwould be a US-Qatari consortium led by Qatar Sports Investments, best known as\nthe ultra-rich owners of French Ligue 1 football outfit Paris Saint-German.\nHowever, Saward says that Apple could also be throwing in its lot at the last\nminute:\n\n“There are whispers from Princes Gate, home of the Formula One group, that\nthere is another round of intensive due diligence going on, which suggests\nthat there is another serious bidder emerging. The whisper is that the latest\nbidder is Apple Inc., which is a company with $161 billion in net cash at the\nmoment.”\n\nA Formula 1 buyout isn’t evidence of an Apple Car, but it offers some decent\ncrossover. As well as acquiring a high-profile platform to promote the Apple\nCar, it would also take on the organisation’s strong relationships with\npremium car makers like Ferrari, Williams, and McClaren. Even more\ninterestingly, as the owner of F1, Apple would be catapulted into a seat at\nthe table with governing body FIA, which also oversees the burgeoning Formula\nE electric car racing series.\n\nPlus, Formula 1 is one of the most-watched sports in the world, so exclusive\nstreaming rights would be a huge boon for Apple TV.\n\n**Delayed launch**\n\nOn July 21, 2016, a new report by The Information claimed that the Apple Car\nwon’t be available until 2021. The article describes how Apple has pushed back\nits internal target of 2020 by a whole year. The report reads:\n\n“One person who worked briefly with the Titan team was told during their\ntenure at Apple that the company had been trying to deliver a vehicle by 2020\nbut the target slipped to 2021.”\n\n**New boss with a familiar face**\n\nOn July 25, 2016, a new WSJ report claimed that Apple had appointed a former\ntop exec to head up its Apple Car project. Bob Mansfield, a former Senior Vice\nPresident at Apple, is now in charge of Project Titan, according to “people\nfamiliar with the matter”. The report noted:\n\n“Earlier this month, employees at Apple noticed in the company directory that\nall the senior managers on the car project were now reporting to Mr\nMansfield.”\n\n![bob\nmansfield](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)Apple’s Bob Mansfield now reportedly heads up\nProject Titan\n\nBob Mansfield is a hardware engineer who was previously Senior Vice President\nof Technologies. He joined Apple in 1999 and worked as a top executive under\nthe late CEO Steve Jobs. Mansfield left the executive team in 2013 to work on\n“special projects under CEO Tim Cook”.\n\nMansfield’s recent career has been shrouded in mystery, with the former\nexecutive having reportedly supervised the development of the Apple Watch and\nsmart television products. He also led the teams that developed the MacBook\nAir, the iMac, and the iPad.\n\n**Focus on driverless tech**\n\nOn July 28, 2016, a Bloomberg report claimed that Apple is placing “increased\nemphasis” on developing self-driving technology, citing people familiar with\nthe project.\n\nThe report says that Apple has hired Dan Dodge, the former head of\nBlackBerry’s automotive software division, to help lead this new push. Dodge\nis reportedly part of a team headed up by Bob Mansfield, who recently took\nover leadership of the Project Titan initiative. Bloomberg also makes clear\nthat Apple is “not abandoning efforts to design its own vehicle”, and that the\ncompany wants to leave options open regarding building its own Apple Car or\npartnering/acquiring an established car maker.\n\n**Hollow batteries**\n\nOn August 9, 2016, Korean news site ETnews reported that Apple had tapped a\nKorean battery company to help develop batteries for the Apple Car. These\nbatteries would, apparently, feature patented hollow battery technology,\nalthough the report declined to name the company in question.\n\nA follow-up article by MacRumors alleged that the company in question may be\nOrange Power, a Korean company that has filed a patent application for hollow-\ntype secondary batteries, and has 33 employees.\n\nHowever, none of the information contained in either report has been\nconfirmed.\n\n**Death to the Apple Car?**\n\nOn September 9, 2016, the New York Times reported that Apple had sacked\n“dozens” of employees working on the Apple Car.\n\nAccording to the report, Apple is rethinking its plans for self-driving cars,\nshuttering parts of the project and even laying off employees. That’s\naccording to three different sources that were brief on the decision, but who\nwere not able to comment on the matter publicly.\n\nThe report suggests that Apple veteran Bob Mansfield, who took the helm on\n‘Project Titan’ back in July, has shifted the focus of the project, moving\nfrom developing a car to “building out the underlying technology for an\nautonomous vehicle”. The new layoffs are said to be a part of this Project\nTitan “reboot” – the total workforce is estimated at around 1,000 employees,\nfor reference.\n\n**McLaren takeover denied**\n\nOn September 21, 2016, the Financial Times reported that Apple had launched a\nbid to buy out McLaren Technology Group, the British supercar giant and owner\nof the eponymous Formula One team.\n\n![mclaren](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nApple reportedly approached McLaren with a view towards a “full takeover”of,\nor the strategic investment in, the car company, citing three people “brief on\nthe negotiations”. The talks are said to have been ongoing for several months,\nand that the takeover may be in a bid to “accelerate Apple’s secretive\nautomotive project”. Sources suggest that McLaren is valued at between £1\nbillion and £1.5 billion.\n\nHowever, McLaren was quick to shut down rumours, releasing a statement that\nsaid: “We can confirm that McLaren is not in discussion with Apple in respect\nof any potential investment.”\n\n**Is it all over?**\n\nOn October 17, 2016, Bloomberg published a report suggesting that the Apple\nCar may never see the light of day, describing how Apple has ‘drastically\nscaled back its automotive ambitions’.  \nApple has decided to pull back on the development its long-rumoured electric\nvehicle, according to the report. Apparently, the iPhone maker has now decided\nto refocus its efforts on developing an autonomous driving system, rather than\ntaking on Tesla with an actual vehicle of its own.\n\nThis re-shifting of priorities has reportedly led to hundreds of job cuts\naffecting the secretive Project Titan team. According to the report, Apple is\nkeeping staff numbers ‘steady’ by hiring new people to work on the driverless\ncar system, following a lengthy spate of reassignments, redundancies, and\nvoluntary departures.\n\nIt’s believed that Apple started designing its own driverless electric vehicle\nback in 2014, with the company embarking on an “aggressive hiring spree” to\nmeet its purported 2020 launch Goal. But Bloomberg remarks that Apple began to\nstruggle early on:\n\n“By the end of 2015, the project was blighted by internal strife. Managers\nbattled about the project’s direction, according to people with knowledge of\nthe operations. ‘It was an incredible failure of leadership,’ one of the\npeople said. In early 2016, project head Steve Zadesky, a former Ford Motor\nCo. engineer and early iPod design, left Titan.”\n\nZadesky was quickly replaced with Apple veteran Bob Mansfield, who quietly\nassumed charge of the Apple Car development. But as Bloomberg explains,\nMansfield quickly shuttered hopes of a vehicle:\n\n“About a month later, Mansfield took the stage in a Silicon Valley auditorium\npacked with hundreds of Titan employees to announce the strategy shift,\naccording to people who attended the meeting. Mansfield explained that he had\nexamined the project and determined that Apple should move from building an\noutright competitor to Tesla Motors Inc. to an underlying self-driving\nplatform.”\n\nAccording to the report, Apple has particularly struggled with automotive\nsupply chains, which is no surprise.\n\n**Maybe this isn’t the end after all**\n\nOn December 4, 2016, Apple revealed its interest in driverless cars in a\nletter written to America’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nThe iPhone maker says it is “excited about the potential of\nautomated…transportation” in a five-page open letter penned by Steve Kenner,\nDirector of Product Integrity at Apple. The letter describes Apple’s ongoing\ninterest in self-driving vehicles, explaining:\n\n“Apple looks forward to collaborating with NHTSA and other stakeholders so\nthat the significant societal benefits of automated vehicles can be realised\nsafely, responsibly, and expeditiously.”\n\nThe letter continues:\n\n“Apple uses machine learning to make its products and services smarter, more\nintuitive, and more personal. The company is investing heavily in the study of\nmachine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of\nautomated systems in many areas, including transportation.”\n\nApple makes a number of requests in the letter, most notably that new entrants\nto the industry – like Apple – should be treated equally to long-time car\nmakers, to “maximise the safety benefits…encourage innovation, and promote\nfair competition”.\n\nKenner refers specifically to a recent provision that Congress enacted with\nthe FAST Act (Fixing America’s Surface Transportation), that allows\nestablished car makers to test on public roads without having to seek legal\nexemptions – but it doesn’t apply to new entrants.\n\n“Instead of applying for exemptions, all companies should be given an\nopportunity to implement internal safety processes summarised in a Safety\nAssessment,” writes Kenner, adding: “This is the most efficient and effective\nway to ensure that development vehicles and designed and operated with a level\nof safety equivalent to best practices and FMVSS and will not be used by the\ngeneral public.”\n\nMaybe the dream of an Apple Car isn’t over at all?\n\n## Apple Car News: 2017\n\n**Automotive experts hired?**\n\nOn March 29, 2017, a report out of Switzerland suggested that “at least” 10\ndoctoral and postdoctoral students from EHT Zurich had left the university to\nwork at a local Apple facility. According to Inside-IT, the former students\nwould be working on the self-driving car project.\n\n**‘Almost certainly’ exploring building a car**\n\nOn April 18, 2017, a report by CNBC detailed how top Apple analyst and venture\ncapitalist Gene Munster believes the company is “almost certainly” exploring\nhow to build an entire car.\n\nMunster was quoted as saying: “In an ideal world, Apple’s car project would\ninvolve the company building the actual automobile, combining hardware and\nsoftware.”\n\n“In reality, the complexity of designing and manufacturing a vehicle may push\nthe company to integrate deeply with an automotive partner or partners in an\neffort more similar to the Apple TV – plugging Apple’s technology into an\nexisting product,” he continued.\n\nMunster added that the “auto market poses challenges that Apple may not be\nable to overcome on the hardware side”, and noted: “Aside from finding a\npartner, we note that the typical automotive design process takes 5-7 years.\nEven on an accelerated timetable, Apple is likely multiple years away from a\ncompleted hardware design for a car.”\n\n**Training documents reveal ongoing plans**\n\nOn April 22, 2017, we reported on a Business Insider article that revealed\nApple had received a permit to test autonomous vehicles on California’s roads.\nThe documents revealed how Apple would be using six drivers to test out three\nLexus RX 450h SUVs.\n\n**Apple Car spotted in the wild?**\n\nOn April 28, 2017, less than two weeks after Apple was given the all-clear to\ntrial driverless cars on Californian roads, images emerged of a Lexus RX450h\ndecked out in autonomous car tech leaving an Apple facility.\n\nThe photos, which were supplied to (and published by) Bloomberg, revealed a\ncar that was kitted with a number of sensors, including 64-channel lidar, two\nradars, and several cameras. Importantly, these sensors appeared to have been\nbought from third-party manufacturers, rather than having been custom-built by\nApple itself.\n\nCheck out the images, courtesy of Bloomberg:\n\n![apple\ncar](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \n![apple\ncar](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \n![apple\ncar](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Tim Cook confirms driverless car efforts**\n\nOn June 13, 2017, during an interview with Bloomberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook\nconfirmed that the company was working on driverless car software.\n\nIt may not have have been the big Apple Car reveal we’d been hoping for, but\nit acts as definitive proof of Apple’s interest in the autonomous vehicle\nsector. According to Cook, the software is a “core technology that Apple sees\nas “very important”.\n\n“We sort of see it as the mother of all AI projects,” Cook explained. “It’s\nprobably one of the most difficult AI projects actually to work on.”\n\nCook didn’t confirm that an Apple Car was in the works however, but he\ncontinued: “Autonomy is something that’s incredibly exciting for us, but we’ll\nsee where it will taking us. We’re not really saying from a product point of\nview what we’ll do, but we’re being straightforward that it’s a core\ntechnology we view as very important.”\n\n**Hertz partnership**\n\nOn June 26, 2017, Bloomberg published a report claiming that Apple had leased\na small fleet of cars from Hertz, the USA’s second largest vehicle rental\nagency.\n\nThe article alleged that Apple was leasing Lexus RX450h SUVs from the Donlen\nfleet-management unit, and cites the source as documents recently released by\nthe Californian Department of Motor Vehicles. These vehicles are supposedly\nbeing used to test autonomous driving software.\n\n## Apple Car hires – Who’s working on the Apple Car?\n\nThe company has been on quite the hiring spree, specifically recruiting\nindividuals with experience in vehicles (particularly electric),\n[autonomisation and AI](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-car-nvidia-\nemployee-hired-for-artificial-intelligence-expertise), and materials research.\nIn fact, [Apple’s poaching](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-car-\ntalk-intensifies-as-more-automotive-experts-sign-on) has been so prolific that\na number of companies – notably\n[A123](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-car-rumours-continue-as-\ncompany-reportedly-poaches-battery-specialists) and [Mission\nMotors](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-car-poaching-killed-\nelectric-motorcycle-start-up-says-ceo) – have spoken out against the tech\ngiant.\n\nNot surprisingly, Tesla has been a particular focus of Apple’s aggressive\nhiring regime.\n\n![Apple Car\n11](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)Elon Musk, Tesla CEO, with a Tesla Model S\n\nWhen asked if Tesla was concerned about Apple’s poaching of its important\nengineers, company founder Elon Musk responded:\n\n“Important engineers? They have hired people we’ve fired. We always jokingly\ncall Apple the ‘Tesla Graveyard’. If you don’t make it at Tesla, you go work\nat Apple. I’m not kidding.”\n\nHowever, [Musk later backtracked](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/elon-\nmusk-apple-twitter-hate) on his comments, tweeting the following:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/statuses/652605371857530880\n\nBut do we have any idea who specifically might be working on the Apple Car?\n[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_electric_car_project) has\ncompiled a list of individuals that may be involved with the project:\n\n![Apple\nwiki](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIt’s clear from the list that Apple has pumped considerable resources into\nattracting people whose experience could be useful in the development of an\nelectric vehicle. Of course, this still isn’t definitive proof; Apple could be\nutilising these individuals’ skills for any number of tangential purposes.\n\nOn January 22, 2016, it emerged that Steve Zadesky – who headed up Project\nTitan since its 2014 inception – was leaving Apple for ‘personal reasons’, as\nfirst reported by the Wall Street Journal. Zadesky had worked at Apple for 16\nyears, and led the Apple Car project for two years; prior to that, he worked\nas an engineer at Ford Motor Co.\n\nAnd on July 25, 2015, the Wall Street Journal reported that former Apple SVP\nBob Mansfield had been moved to a new position from which he now oversees the\ndevelopment of Project Titan. Employees at the company reportedly noticed that\n“all senior managers” now report to Mansfield.\n\n**Related:[9 creepy ways robots are replacing\nhumans](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/9-creepy-ways-robots-are-\nreplacing-humans)**\n\n## Apple Car release date – When will the Apple Car launch?\n\nIn spite of how vague the rumours about the Apple Car have been thus far, most\nsources seem to agree on a launch time frame. While we don’t have an exact\ndate, the general consensus is that the Apple Car release is set for 2019 or\n2020.\n\nApple investor tycoon [Carl Icahn](http://carlicahn.com/carl-icahn-issues-\nopen-letter-to-tim-cook/) says Apple is eyeing 2020, which is echoed by [a\nBloomberg report](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-car-to-enter-\nproduction-by-2020-report-claims). The Wall Street Journal, meanwhile,\nreported in 2015 that the [Apple Car would land in five year’s\ntime](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/the-first-apple-car-is-less-than-\nfive-years-away-wsj-claims) – that’s 2019. That might seem far off, and so it\nshould; developing a vehicle is no mean feat. That’s especially true for\nApple, a company that is – aside from CarPlay – entirely green to the\nautomotive industry.\n\nBut is it already too late for Apple to enter the car business? According to\nTesla’s Elon Musk, the Apple Car is a “missed opportunity”. Speaking during an\n[interview](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-car-is-already-too-late-\nsays-tesla-boss-elon-musk) at the Code Conference in California, Musk said:\n\n“I think they should have embarked on this project sooner. I don’t think\nthey’ll be in production sooner until 2020. It’s just a missed opportunity.\nIt’s a couple years…they’ll make a good car and be successful.”\n\nHowever, he added: “I think it’s great they’re doing this, and I hope it works\nout.”\n\n![Apple\nCar](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)Apple CarPlay\n\n## Can Apple really build a car?\n\nApple has money by the truck-load, but that’s no guarantee that the Apple Car\nwill be a successful venture, right?\n\nIn fact, a number of industry executives have already [spoken out against\nApple’s rumoured efforts](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/mercedes-benz-\nchairman-not-losing-any-sleep-over-apple-car-rumours), including former GM and\nBMW exec Bob Lutz:\n\n“If I were a shareholder I’d be very upset, because they’re currently engaged\nin a very high-margin business and the automobile business, at best, is a very\nlow-margin business. And you can’t show me one company in the world that, to\ndate, has made a nickel on electric cars. There is absolutely no reason to\nassume that Apple is going to be financially successful in the electric car\nbusiness.”\n\nThe damning verdict continued:\n\n“When it comes to actually making cars, there is no reason to assume that\nApple, with no experience, will suddenly do a better job than General Motors,\nFord, Volkswagen, Toyota, or Hyundai. So I think this is going to be a\ngigantic money pit, but then it doesn’t matter. I mean Apple has an\nembarrassment of riches, they don’t know where to put the cash anymore. So if\nthey burn 30 or 40 billion dollars in the car business, no one’s going to\nnotice.”\n\n![Apple Car\n29](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)The Toyota Prius, a full hybrid electric mid-size\nhatchback\n\nHe added: “If I were a board member of Apple, I’d ask some serious questions\nabout this thing.”\n\nLutz isn’t the only one to cast doubts about the technology industry’s ability\nto develop a quality autonomous EV by 2020. Speaking to _TrustedReviews_ , [a\nFord engineer revealed](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-won-t-\nhit-2020-self-driving-car-goal-says-ford-engineer) that self-driving cars are\n“at least 15 years or so away”, specifically citing Google’s plan for self-\ndriving cars by 2020.\n\n“I think 2020 is unrealistic, at least not on very road. Maybe in their\nenvironment in their city, but not on every road,” Andreas Meyer, a Ford\ndevelopment engineers, told us.\n\nWe also spoke to [Nvidia](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/nvidia-apple-\ncar-learning-curve), who cast doubts on Apple’s ability to turn out a car very\nquickly. In an interview with _TrustedReviews_ at CES 2016 in Las Vegas, Dave\nAnderson, Senior Manager of Automotive Integration at Nvidia, described how\nbuilding vehicles is a challenging process, even for Apple.\n\n“The long standing tradition of making cars is something that is a significant\nlearning curve, and even with a company that’s as sophisticated as Apple – and\nGoogle – that process still takes time,” he explained.\n\nHowever, Anderson described how technology companies like Apple – which have a\nlongstanding history in computing systems – have a good shot at overtaking\ntraditional vendors.\n\n“There is somewhat of an advantage initially, and you could see [Ford]\nsupplanted by very motivated companies, like Tesla,” he continued. “Literally\nwith that dedication and that motivation, [Elon Musk] created a car company\nwithin about ten years. But again, it’s ten years.”\n\nNvidia currently builds computing systems for cars, and is developing\ntechnology for a self-driving future.  \nThe firm, best known for its graphics cards, has a number of partners in the\ncar space, including Audi, BMW, and Daimler. But despite these doubts, all\nthings point to Apple trundling along towards its 2020 launch window.\n\n![ford](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)Ford autonomous driving technology at CES 2016\n\nA surprising proponent of the long-rumoured [Apple Car is\nFord](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ford-apple-car-interview), as\nrevealed during an exclusive interview with Don Butler, Executive Director for\nConnected Vehicles and Services at the company, speaking to _TrustedReviews_\nat CES 2016. Butler said he believes both Apple and Google can create\nsuccessful car franchises, and is excited to see competitors join the\nindustry.\n\n“We welcome othes joining. We welcome the activity that’s in the space. We\nthink it’s exciting. It’s actually changed that we are embracing,” Butler told\nus. “So I think Apple can do it. I think Google can do it.”\n\nFord’s connected vehicles lead continued: “I think that what you will most\nlikely see is a number of partnerships with companies that bring different\nskill-sets to the table working together to deliver solutions that neither of\nthem could have done possibly on their own.”\n\nButler also told us he thinks fully [self-driving cars will be on the road by\n2020](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ford-self-driving-cars-2020), which\ngels with Apple’s much-mooted 2019/2020 timeline.\n\nAnd in April, the CEO of Ford revealed that the car-maker has a “working\nassumption” that Apple is building an Apple Car, during an interview with the\nBBC. Mark Fields said that he really has “no idea” whether Apple is creating a\ncar:\n\n“I read what everybody else reads in the paper. Our working assumption is that\nthey are, and that again provides us the right motivation to make sure that we\nstay very focused, not only on the product, but overall on the experience that\nthe customer has.”\n\n“There’s a lot of traditional competitors that we have in our business who we\nknow and respect,” the Ford CEO explained. “There’s a lot of new non-\ntraditional competitors, who are looking at the automotive space and looking\nat that addressable market and saying ‘Gee, can we get a piece of that?'”\n\nHe added: “From our standpoint, we’re looking at a number of the technological\nchanges in the industry, and we’re viewing that as an opportunity, not as a\nthreat.”\n\n**Check out our interview with Ford on the future of autonomous vehicles:**\n\n## Apple Car design – What will the Apple Car look like?\n\nRight, so there’s plenty of evidence that Apple might be building a car, but\nwhat would such a vehicle look like?\n\nWell we already know that Apple has a penchant for slick minimalism, an\naesthetic that’s maintained across all of its products. Unfortunately, all\nthings point to Apple still being in the design phase for the Apple Car, so\nit’s unlikely that the finer details will have been finalised yet.\n\nOur best clue yet is the WSJ mentioned earlier – dated 13 February – that\nclaims Apple “is working on the design of a vehicle that resembles a mini-\nvan”.\n\nWhat does that tell us? It tells us that the Apple Car, at least in early\ndesign stages, will be big enough to carry at least five people. It also tells\nus that Apple might not be eyeing direct competition with the BMW i8 electric\nsupercar.\n\n![BMW i8](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)The BMW i8\n\nIn terms of colour, there’s no information in the ether as yet – but we can\ntake a guess. While Apple products of sported a host of paintjobs in the past,\nit has recently tended towards a select few hues. We’re talking about black,\nwhite, champagne, rose gold, silver, and space grey – core colours for\ncontemporary Apple fare, and all in with a chance of being splashed across the\nchassis of an Apple Car.\n\nJean Louis-Gassee, a former Apple executive writing for the [Monday\nNote](http://www.mondaynote.com/2015/11/30/more-apple-car-thoughts/), explains\nthat Apple may just offer a single colour option.\n\n“Just as Apple managed to get much higher iPod margins than competing makers,\ncan the Cupertino company do better than Toyota or Ford?” he writes. “One way\nApple could simplify the path to profits would be to offer a single model in a\nsingle colour (rose gold maybe; white, more likely).”\n\nOn January 5, 2016, an Argentinian designer Matias Papalini has revealed his\nvision for the [Apple Car interior](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/is-\nthis-what-the-apple-car-interior-will-look-like).

See what’s cooking in Google’s secret\nlab](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/what-is-google-x)**\n\n## Apple Car technology – Is the Apple Car driverless or electric?\n\nTwo of the most commonly asked questions about the Apple Car are whether it\nwill be (1) electric, and (2) driverless. Let’s tackle these one at a time.\n\nFor the former, we’d have to say yes, the Apple Car – should it exist – will\nalmost certainly be electric. For a start, the majority of Apple’s auto-\nindustry hires have at least some experience with electric vehicles. That’s\nevident from the aggressive acquisition of Tesla staff, a company that’s built\nits name off the back of electric cars. It’s also clear that the industry is\nnow tending towards electric cars; tech magnate Sir Richard Branson has even\npredicted that there will be no “diesel or petrol internal combustion engines\nanywhere in the world” by 2020.\n\nSo if the future of cars is electric, and Apple is building a car for the\nfuture, it makes sense that the vehicle should be electric. And that’s not\nforgetting the persistent Apple Car leaks, all of which agree that the Apple\nCar will be electric. But the question of whether the Apple Car will be\ndriverless is a little tougher to answer. While electric cars have certainly\ncome to the fore, driverless vehicles still attract plenty of scepticism.\n\n![Apple Car\n15](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)Google’s driverless car\n\nThat’s because while autonomous vehicles might sound great on paper, putting\ncars on the road without an actual human behind the wheel is very difficult to\nroll out in practice.\n\n“No one is going to want to realise autonomous driving into the world until\nthere’s proof that it’s much safer, like a factor of 100 safer, than having a\nhuman drive,” said Andrew Moore, dean of computer science at Carnegie Mellon,\nspeaking to The Atlantic.\n\nMoore continued: “But even then, at a factor of 100 safer, it won’t be long\nbefore there is an accident.”\n\nOur best guess is that if Apple wants to hit its rumoured 2020 deadline, it\nwill need to focus on electric cars initially.\n\nTo create a driverless vehicle will require a significant amount of\ndevelopment, and not just on the part of Apple; our governments still have to\ndevelop road infrastructure and legislation to the point where autonomous cars\ncan be realistically used in public.\n\nThat said, there’s some evidence that Apple has been working on autonomous\ndriving. Take, for instance, The Guardian report from 14 August that claims\nApple is eyeing a testing ground for autonomous vehicles at a former naval\nbase. Or The Guardian’s 18 September report that revealed Apple met with\nCalifornia’s DMV for discussions with driverless car experts.\n\nSo whether or not Apple is developing an autonomous Apple Car, it appears that\nthe company has, at least, shown some interest in driverless technology.\n\n**Related:[What is Google Project Wing and when will it take\noff?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/what-is-google-project-wing)**\n\n## Apple Car price – How much will the Apple Car cost?\n\nLet’s say Apple is working on an electric vehicle – how much will it set you\nback? If previous Apple products are anything to go by, it’s likely that the\nApple Car won’t come cheap.\n\nWell according to technology analysts at Jefferies and Co, the [Apple Car\nprice will be set at $55,000](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-car-\nprice-cost-analysts). That’s an estimated price, which the analysts claim\nrepresents an average across several Apple Car variants, detailed in a 68-page\nreport. That might sound expensive – the BMW i3 starts at $42,400 – but the\nApple Car isn’t expected to go on sale for a long time, in a future market\nthat will inevitably demand higher mark-ups.\n\n![Apple Car\n3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)The BMW i3\n\nJefferies and Co also predicted that Apple will sell at least 200,000 units of\nits very first vehicle. That’s a sizeable figure, especially as Tesla is\nexpected to sell just 55,000 cars in 2015. Realistically, though, we have no\nidea how much the Apple Car will cost until Apple gets up on stage and reveals\nthe figure to the world – if such a day ever comes.\n\n**Ford Interview – The Future of Autonomous Cars (Uncut):**\n\n**What do you make of the Apple Car rumours?
