It has a lovely HDR10 display, slim\ndimensions and a dual camera array on the back.\n\nBut it does have what it takes to compete with the [OnePlus\n6T](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/oneplus-6t), [Samsung Galaxy\nS9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9) and [iPhone\nXS?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xs)\n\n## **LG G7 – Design**\n\nDesign hasn’t been one of LG’s strengths recently, and the G7 feels like a\nhodgepodge of different ideas and inspirations. It’s part LG V30, part LG G6;\nand then part every other Android phone this year that’s shoehorned a notch\ninto their design.\n\n**Related:[OnePlus 6T](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/oneplus-6t-release-\ndate-3525032)**\n\nThe rear of the device is constructed from Gorilla Glass 5, with a metal rim\nadding rigidity and a nearly edge-to-edge screen on the front. The back feels\nhollow – like it’s missing a battery – and almost toy-like in the hand. Like\nall glass-backed devices, the G7 picks up smudges and fingerprints easily.\n\nOn that glass back are two cameras, a circular fingerprint scanner and LG G7\nThinQ branding. ThinQ refers to the brand’s ‘Smart AI’ tech – and, yes, it’s a\nsilly name for the phone so I’ll just call it the LG G7. Which is what\neveryone else will likely do, too.\n\n**Related:[Best smartphones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nsmartphone-3431175)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Google Home Hub YouTube](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n###  Will Google Home Hub ever get Netflix?

It also no longer\nfunctions as the standby button; that moves to the side of the device.\n\nWhat I do like is just how narrow the LG G7 feels. Unlike the OnePlus 6, which\nI often found myself clutching to with both hands, the G7 is easy to use\nsingle-handed.\n\nAnother new addition to the design is a dedicated hardware key to enable\nGoogle Assistant. Tapping the button once pops up the handy Assistant, while\ndouble-tapping it opens the object recognition tool, Google Lens. After\nsuffering through the pain of having a dedicated button for the pretty poor\nBixby on the Samsung Galaxy S9, I thought the experience would play out\nsimilarly here – but this isn’t the case.\n\n![LG G7](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nGoogle Assistant is far better than Bixby and I constantly found myself\npressing the button to avoid saying ‘OK Google’. The dedicated button is also\nbetter than the squeeze functionality available on the [Pixel\n2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-2), because I never\nfound myself accidentally bringing up the Assistant. Rather annoyingly, you\ncan’t remap the button – but you can disable it completely.\n\nThe G7 is properly water-resistant to the IP68 standard, retains the headphone\njack alongside the USB-C port at the bottom, and doesn’t have a camera bump –\nall of which are welcome.\n\n## **LG G7 – Screen**\n\nMany folk will instantly be drawn to the notch on the display of the LG G7,\nbut it’s the fantastic screen that should really be the focus. It’s the best\nLCD I’ve used on a phone and it’s significantly better than the OLEDs made by\nLG and used in the V30 and Google Pixel 2 XL.\n\nThe 19:9 LCD packs a quad-HD+ resolution and 100% coverage of the\nprofessionally used DCI-P3 colour gamut. There’s also “Super Bright” tech\nonboard that will take advantage of the screen’s 1000 nits max brightness.\n\n![LG G7](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIn general, the G7’s screen will never go above 600-700 nits, unless you enter\na set of predefined conditions – such as very bright sunlight – where it will\nkick into “Super Bright” mode. You can also manually crank up the screen\nbrightness to 1000 nits for three minutes by tapping on an icon next the\nbrightness slider.\n\nA couple of Samsung’s past flagships – including the S9 and [Note\n9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-9) – have been\nable to crack the 1000 nits barrier, but they haven’t been user-togglable and\nit’s been difficult to gauge when a device may have been using all the\navailable power.\n\nWhether or not you’ll really make full use of the bright display will be down\nto the environment you’re in, but enabling the full 1000 nits when it’s sunny\nis an absolute revelation when it comes to outdoor visibility.\n\nThe display has plenty of other tricks, too. It’s\n[HDR](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/amazon-prime-video-\nhdr10-support-3354643)-certified for Netflix and YouTube, and viewing shows\nsuch as _Altered Carbon_ with that extra contrast and burst of colour is a\njoy. There are also a fair few screen-tweaking options including colour\noptimisation (default), gallery, eco, cinema, sports, games and expert\noptions. My preference was cinema, which was slightly more orangey than the\nothers, taking the harshness out of whites.\n\n![LG G7](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAfter the disappointing screen on the\n[V30](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/lg-v30), LG has well and truly\nbounced back here. The G7’s panel is sharp, colourful and stunning to look at.\nIt isn’t quite as good as the OLED on the Galaxy S9, but it certainly isn’t\nfar off.\n\nMy biggest issue with the lack of OLED is when you’re watching a video and it\ndoesn’t wrap around the notch; the areas of black screen are very noticeable.\nIt’s a minor problem and one that you’ll likely only notice in a very dark\nroom.\n\n[ Next  \nPerformance and Software\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/lg-g7-performance-and-software)\n\n"}
