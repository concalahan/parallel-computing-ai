In a blog\npost last month, Spotify\n[explained](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2018-10-17/hello-wear-os-by-googletm-\nspotify-here/):\n\n“With Spotify on your Wear OS by Google smartwatch, you no longer need to\nreach for your phone to access your Discover Weekly playlist. Imagine a run\nthrough the park without fumbling to adjust the smartphone on your armband\ncase to play, pause, or skip to the next track.\n\n“Switching to a song that matches your mood and the tempo of your jog is now\nas easy as starting your stopwatch. (Or, if you’re a walking-while-podcasting\ntype, easily rewind 15 seconds to catch that detail you missed.)”\n\nThat app is scheduled to be updated soon and we hope to see offline downloads\nincluded on the next go-around.\n\n**How long have you been waiting for Spotify to launch on Apple Watch?
