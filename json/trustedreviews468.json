Well it certainly\nhas the spare capital to try. Last quarter saw the tech giant post [a world\nrecord profit of $18 billion](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-\nsmashes-its-all-time-record-with-74-5m-iphone-sales), while the firm’s cash\nreserves are known to be in excess of $178 billion (£116bn).\n\nIt’s also important to remember that Apple typically avoids being the first to\nmarket for various product categories. Other companies beat Apple to the punch\nwith smartphones, tablets, portable music players, and smartwatches.\n\nThis means that Apple could look to rectify mistakes made by Tesla and other\nelectric car manufacturers. Tesla plans to launch a new electric car in 2017.\n\nApple has already dipped its tow in the automotive market too, having launched\nits [CarPlay dashboard interface](https://www.trustedreviews.com/apple-\ncarplay-review). It’s likely an actual Apple Car would see this system\nintegrated.\n\n"}
