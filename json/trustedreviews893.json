Since\nthen, it’s become one of the most talked-about gadgets in Britain, and it’s\neasy to see why.\n\nAmazon’s cylindrical speaker comes with the Alexa digital assistant built in,\nhelping you manage your life via voice control. You can order an Uber, arrange\na pizza delivery, set a timer, or listen to an audiobook with ease.\n\nIn September 2017, we finally got a successor to the speaker – the Amazon Echo\n2. It’s got plenty of upgrades to show off, so read on for all the details.\n\nAlternatively, these [Amazon Black Friday 2017\ndeals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/amazon-black-friday-\ndeals-2017-uk-2993188) can let you check out the Echo for yourself at a\nfraction of the usual cost.\n\n  * **B** **uy Now**[ **: Amazon Echo for just £69.99 – save £20**](http://amzn.to/2jrGvUt)\n  * **Buy Now:[Amazon Echo Plus down to £109.99 – save £30](http://amzn.to/2jSVhnh)**\n  * **Buy Now:[Amazon Echo Dot for just £34.99](http://amzn.to/2jrGT5n)[ – save £15](http://amzn.to/2jrGT5n)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n![Amazon\nEcho](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: Amazon\n\n## Amazon Echo 2 Release Date and Price: When can you buy it?\n\nFirst things first, let’s talk about actually getting your hands on one. The\nold Amazon Echo is no longer on sale, so if you want a standard Echo then the\nsecond-generation model is your only choice.\n\nYou can already place a pre-order for the speaker right now, which you can via\nthe Amazon link below for £89.99 in the UK.\n\nIt was released on October 31, 2017.\n\n**Related:[Best Echo deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-cheap-\namazon-echo-deals-3244399)**\n\n## Amazon Echo 2 vs Amazon Echo Design: What’s new?\n\nThe new Amazon Echo may have the same name as its predecessor, but the design\nhas received a significant overhaul.\n\nFor a start, the speaker is now much smaller, with a height of just 14.8cm.\nThat’s about two-thirds of the size of the old 23.5cm Amazon Echo, so the new\nmodel is certainly less obtrusive on a shelf or worktop. It’s a little wider,\nmind, but you won’t really notice the difference.\n\nIt’s also coated in a new fabric skin, doing away with the hard exterior of\nthe first generation. In the UK, you can bag this fabric in a variety of\ncolour options that include Charcoal, Heather Grey, and Sandstone. We’re also\nreliably informed that Oak, Walnut, and Silver non-fabric versions are\navailable too.\n\nThere are some familiar motifs, however. For instance, the famously\ncylindrical design has been retained, as have the buttons that reside on the\ntop of the speaker – letting you deactivate the microphone, for instance.\n\n![Amazon\nEcho](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: Amazon\n\n## Amazon Echo 2 vs Amazon Echo Specs: What’s new?\n\nAs far as hardware goes, we’ve seen some upgrades. For instance, Amazon says\nthat the Amazon Echo 2 has an “all-new speaker architecture” that includes a\ndedicated tweeter, a 2.5-inch downward-firing woofer, and Dolby processing to\nboot. The latter is supposed to help deliver crisp vocals and dynamic bass\nthroughout a room.\n\nAmazon has also introduced a second-generation version of its far-field audio\ncapture technology. This means you should enjoy better wake-word (read:\n“Alexa”) processing, as well as improvements to beam-forming and noise\ncancellation that should result in better voice recognition overall.\n\n  * **B** **uy Now**[ **: Amazon Echo for just £69.99 – save £20**](http://amzn.to/2jrGvUt)\n  * **Buy Now:[Amazon Echo Plus down to £109.99 – save £30](http://amzn.to/2jSVhnh)**\n  * **Buy Now:[Amazon Echo Dot for just £34.99](http://amzn.to/2jrGT5n)[ – save £15](http://amzn.to/2jrGT5n)**\n\n**What do you think of the all-new Amazon Echo (2nd generation)?
