It’s still far from cheap,\nhowever. With prices hitting £899/$899 for the 512GB model, it costs more than\nthe [iPhone 8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-8).\n\nThe iPhone XS and XS Max both replace the singular [iPhone\nX](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-x) from 2018 and sit at the\ntop of the range of smartphones. The XS is near-identical to the X with a\n5.8-inch display, while the XS Max is the next-generation Plus variant with a\nwhopping 6.5-inch panel.\n\nNow that we have the basics out of the way, let’s have a look at how the new\niPhones compare internally and externally.\n\n### Trusted Reviews Exclusive iPhone XS Deal\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n###\n\n[Apple iPhone XS – 10GB, £40pm with £350 upfront on O2\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\nGiving you plenty of data for the low price of just £40 a month, this monthly\ncontract with O2 is an incredible deal that can't be missed if you want to be\none of the first people to own an iPhone XS.\n\n[Mobiles.co.uk\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n|\n\n£350 upfront\n\n|\n\n£40/month\n\n[View\nDeal](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n£40/month\n\n|\n\n£350 upfront\n\n|\n\n[Mobiles.co.uk\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n### Best iPhone XR Deals\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=tr-\niphonexr&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xr-64gb-\nblack%3Ftariffcode%3DDD1ZMFEB18)\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=tr-\niphonexr&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xr-64gb-\nblack%3Ftariffcode%3DDD1ZMFEB18)\n\n###\n\n[Apple iPhone XR 64GB Black – 4GB of data on Vodafone (use code TRUSTED10)\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=tr-\niphonexr&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xr-64gb-\nblack%3Ftariffcode%3DDD1ZMFEB18)\n\nIf you don't mind paying an upfront cost and only need a moderate amount of\ndata a month, this contract gets you a low monthly cost.

The iPhone XR\ncomes with a 6.1-inch Liquid Retina LCD panel, while the XS uses Super Retina\nOLED tech. It’s also available in two sizes: 5.8-inch and 6.5-inch.\n\nIt’s clear, if you’ve got the two phones side-by-side the OLED panel looks\nnoticeably better. Colours on OLEDs are brighter and contrast is better.\n[HDR](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/hdr-tv-high-dynamic-television-\nexplained-2927035) content should also look superior thanks to the ability of\n[OLED](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/oled-vs-led-lcd-2924602) to\ndisplay perfect blacks. However, the Liquid Retina display is by no means\nterrible, even though the resolution 1792 x 828 is fairly low.\n\n[iOS 12](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ios-12-devices-features-beta-\ndownload-3385158) will run on all the new iPhones, bringing features such as\nScreen Time, improved notifications and a focus on speed and performance.\n\n![iPhone XR vs iPhone XS\nMax](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\niPhone XS Max vs iPhone XR\n\n## **iPhone XR vs iPhone XS vs iPhone XS Max – Look and feel**\n\nAll of Apple’s new phones mimic the iPhone X’s iconic design. That means all\nthree have near edge-to-edge displays.\n\nNone have a Touch ID fingerprint sensor, instead relying on [Face\nID](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/face-id-3286453) for unlocking and\naccessing private apps. This means the notch is now commonplace across Apple’s\n2018 phone line.\n\nOther similarities include the glass rears, support for Qi [wireless\ncharging](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-wireless-charger-3505891)\nand water-resistance ratings. It’s great to see Apple keep these features\nsimilar across all phones, even if the iPhone XS does have the slightly higher\nIP68, as opposed IP67, rating.\n\nThere are some other big differences between the devices, though. The iPhone\nXR is the more colourful of the new phones, coming in a range of hues\nincluding blue, black, white, coral, yellow and red. If you plump for the\niPhone XS or iPhone XS Max then colour options are limited to silver, grey or\nthe new gold.\n\n**Related:[AirPower](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-airpower-\nwireless-charging-release-date-price-3402369)**\n\nThe phones are made up of different materials, too. The iPhone XR has\naluminium sides, while the iPhone XS and XS Max both use stainless steel.\nStainless steel is a bit shinier and has a more ‘premium’ finish.\n\nNone of the three phones has a headphone jack – something you probably should\nexpect from Apple – and it seems that Apple has removed the 3.5mm adapter from\nthe box, too.\n\n## **iPhone XR vs iPhone XS vs iPhone XS Max – How good are the photos?**\n\nApple is pushing cameras hard with these new phones, with all models\nbenefitting from at least some form of upgrade. The iPhone XS and XS Max both\nhave dual 12-megapixel cameras on the rear. One of these is an f/1.8 main\nsensor, while the other is a wide-angle sensor with an f/2.4 aperture. Both\nfeature OIS.\n\nThe iPhone XR’s camera is the same as the one on the iPhone XS, but it’s a\nsingle-sensor arrangement.\n\n![iPhone XS Max vs iPhone XR vs iPhone\nXS](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\niPhone XS Max vs iPhone XR vs iPhone X\n\nAll three phones boast a Smart HDR mode for improving highlights and shadows,\nalong with improved selfie cameras with a faster sensor and the ability to\nshoot in Portrait mode with variable depth effects.\n\nPhotos from the main camera are similar between all the devices. That\n12-megapixel sensor takes reliably colourful shots with great dynamic range\nand impressive contrast.\n\nThe bigger difference is with the portrait mode. As the iPhone XR only has one\nsensor, it lacks the telephoto camera of the XS and as such it can’t create\nthe same depth map needed to accurately differentiate between the foreground\nand the background. Instead, it purely uses software and the results, while\nstill good, are a little more rough around the edges. Check out our iPhone XS\nand iPhone XR reviews for a more in-depth look at the cameras.\n\n## **iPhone XR vs iPhone XS vs iPhone XS Max – How much does it cost?**\n\nPricing for the iPhone XR starts at $749/£749 for the 64GB. The 128GB version\nwill set you back $£799/£799 and the 256GB will cost $899/£899.\n\nThe iPhone XS starts at $999/£999 for the 5.8-inch (64GB) version rising to\n£1349 for the 512GB and $1099/£1099 for the iPhone XS Max. If you want more\nstorage you’ll to pay £1249 for the 256GB and £1449 for the 512GB version.

Unless you really care about the screen (and it’s worth\n£250/$250 to you) then we’d say plump for the iPhone XR.\n\n"}
