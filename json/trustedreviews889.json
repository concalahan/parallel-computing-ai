That gets you the 32GB, Wi-\nFi-only model. The 128GB model with Wi-Fi and cellular connectivity costs a\nmuch heftier £539. In the US, meanwhile, it’s available to consumers from\n$329.\n\n**Related:[New iPad\n(2018)](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ipad-2018-release-date-3423309)**\n\nHowever, if you’re a student, you can shave a little off those figures. Apple\nhas a special ‘Education Pricing’ store, which lets you buy its products at\nslightly discounted prices.\n\n“To help you get everything you need, Apple offers education pricing for\nuniversity students, students accepted into university, parents buying for\nuniversity students, and teachers and staff at all levels,” the company says.\n\nAll you need to do is prove you’re a current student or member of staff.\n\nIn the UK, the Education Pricing version of the Apple Store is hidden behind a\n[verification\nbarrier](https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/browse/home/education_routing/find_your_institution/access),\nwhich you can only get past by entering your UNiDAYS account details. But\nbased on prior experience, we can confirm that it indeed is the real deal and\nwill get you the best Apple deals around – provided you’re eligible.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nJust don’t like, OK? You’ll get caught out and this isn’t dodging a forced\nWindows upgrade, after all…\n\nWe’ve asked Apple for UK education pricing figures, and will update this\narticle when we hear back.\n\nWhat we also know is that discounts apply across Apple’s range, but different\nproducts are discounted at different rates.\n\nIn the US, there’s no barrier and the price differences are therefore much\nclearer. If you’re a student or member of staff, you can get the new 2018 iPad\nfor $309 rather than $329. That’s a handy little reduction well worth taking\nadvantage of.\n\nWe’d expect similar discounts on Apple products here in Blighty, though note\nthat said new Apple tablet already enjoys a £20 price cut (compared to the\nprevious 2017 model) when buying in the UK. So you may already be in luck, as\nit were.\n\nThe new tablet is available in silver, space grey and gold colour schemes, and\nwill begin shipping to buyers this week.\n\nIf you’re eligible, be sure to head over to the [Apple Store for\nEducation](https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/browse/home/education_routing/find_your_institution/access)\npage to check out the discounts.\n\n**What are your initial thoughts on the new iPad?
