Let us explain.\n\nAmazon Dash Buttons are simple, single button units that can be stuck or hung\nanywhere around your house. When connected to a Wi-Fi network and pressed,\nthey order a single commonly stocked item from Amazon. Buttons cost £4.99 a\npop, but you get a £4.99 ‘discount’ on your first Dash order, making them\nessentially free.\n\nThe idea is that you place them strategically around the house, so you can\neasily order more toilet paper when you’re on the bog, stock up on coffee pods\nin the kitchen, and so on. Each button is individually branded with a specific\ncompany’s livery, reflecting the device’s singular purpose.\n\nAs we mentioned, there were 40 supported brands for Amazon Dash’s 2016 UK\nlaunch, with the number now having risen to over 65.\n\nAs Amazon has your details on file, you don’t need to do anything else. Just\npress the button, and the linked product will be delivered using your 1-Click\nordering preferences for shipping address and payment method.\n\n**Related:[Best Amazon deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/best-amazon-\ndeals-uk)**\n\n![Dash\nprime](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Setting Up Amazon Dash Buttons\n\nThe Amazon Dash buttons are incredibly easy to set up. After grabbing the most\nrecent version of the Amazon shopping app for iOS (or Android), you can be up\nand running in a matter of minutes.\n\nFirst up, I decided to grab the most important Dash Button – the one for\ndelivering fresh toilet roll. It was just a case of opening the Dash Button\nsection of the app, confirming my home Wi-Fi connection and then holding the\nDash Button down until the blue light flashed.\n\nNext you have to pair the button to the your, which makes a neat sci-fi/dial-\nup-internet-style buzzing sound while completing the task.\n\nNext, you need to select the product you want to associate with the button\nevery time you press to reorder. I selected my item, confirmed payment and\nshipping information, then affixed the button – there’s adhesive or a rung to\nplace on a hook – next to my toilet. (I mean, where else, right?)\n\n![Amazon Dash Buttons Set\nup](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAfter pressing the button for the first time late on a Friday night – yes, I\nspent my Friday night ordering toilet roll from the internet – a green LED\nlight flashed to confirm the order.\n\nI instantly got a notification through the app and an email. Pretty nifty.\nThere are a lot more high-tech items in my house, but this feels pretty cool\nand futuristic even though the tech behind it is relatively simple.\n\nThere are safety measures built in, too, with your Amazon Dash unit programmed\nto only result to the initial press, unless otherwise specified. You’ll also\nget an order alert sent through to your phone whenever one is raised, which\nwill enable you to cancel any erroneous inputs resulting from curious\nchildren.\n\n## Dash Replenishment Service\n\nAmazon’s Dash Replenishment Service takes things one step further, letting\nproducts with IoT capabilities automatically register the need to re-stock, so\nyou can be shipped your essentials without even pressing a button.\n\nSome of the participating manufacturers include Samsung, Bosch, Whirlpool and\nBrother. Has there ever been a more tantalising prospect than finding printer\nink on your doorstep at exactly the right time?\n\nDon’t want bits of plastic cluttering up your humble abode? Not to worry, as\nin January 2017, Amazon introduced Virtual Dash Buttons.\n\nThese live on Amazon’s website and app, surfacing shopping suggestions based\non items you recently or frequently order. Just like with physical Dash\nButtons, tapping a Virtual Dash Button places an order with a single click.\n\nBetter still, they’re completely free to use, so make for an ideal jumping off\npoint if you’re intrigued by the prospect of Dash Buttons, but aren’t ready to\ngo all-in.\n\nNote that Amazon Dash Buttons are available exclusively to Prime members.\nThink they sound pretty neat?

So, the likes of Andrex, Ariel, Finish,\nFairy, Detol, Lenor and Vanish have proved to be popular selections.\n\nToiletries and beauty products from the likes of Gillette, Right Guard,\nWilkinson Sword, Listerine, Olay, Rimmel and Neutrogena will keep you looking\nand smelling good.\n\nSpeaking of smelling, if you have a new baby at home then Huggies and\nJohnson’s Baby products will require constant replenishment. The former has 21\nproducts to chose from, while the latter has just one.\n\nA Huggies Dash Button on the nappy bag seems like a great idea, for example.\nIt’s not like you can just nip to the shops when you realise you’ve run out.\n\nSame goes for the Durex Dash Button. If you’d had one of those, maybe you\nwouldn’t be up to your elbows in baby poop in the first place, amirite?\n\n![Durex](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAmazon is reporting that beyond the listed cleaning brands, Gillette (32\nproducts), Nescafé Dolche Gusto coffee capsules and Whiskas cat foot are the\ncurrently the most popular.\n\nOf the new breed, we’re expecting batteries from Duracell (next to the Xbox\nOne perhaps?) and, of course Heineken being among the most popular.\n\n## Verdict\n\nWhen I told people about the Dash buttons, their first response was “Can you\nprogram them to order anything?” The answer, of course, is no. But wouldn’t\nthat be something? If these were ubiquitous and could be programmed to order\nanything, having a few of these around the house would be damned handy.\n\nFor the guitarist who’s just strung his spare set, or for the home brewer who\nalways likes to have extra yeast on hand. Socks. Most people need more socks\nmost of the time, right?\n\nUnfortunately, a programmable Dash Button isn’t in the immediate future, so\nwho are these things for in their current form? Rushed parents, lazy bachelors\nand bachelorettes, generally forgetful humans and slaves to the leading brands\nwho’re willing to pay whatever the cost for the ultimate convenience.\n\nIf you fit one or more of those categories then the Dash Buttons are amazing.\nFill your house with them immediately.\n\n**Have you been using Amazon’s Dash Buttons?
