I hope I will be able to play a role in helping to navigate\nthat journey.”\n\n**Related:[How to delete Facebook\npermanently](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-delete-facebook-\naccount-2950145)**\n\nPresumably, with a job title like vice-president of global affairs and\ncommunications, he’ll be charged with combating some of those prevalent issues\nfacing Facebook and presenting the public response.
