Here are some of our early favourites\n\nWith two of Apple’s three new 2018 iPhones just days away from launch,\ninterested parties (which may well mean you) might want to start thinking\nabout wrapping these $1000+/£1000+ handsets up in some sort of protection.\n\nLuckily there are already a wealth of [iPhone\nXS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-xs-release-date-specs-price-\nuk-3551351) and iPhone XS Max cases out there to consider and we’ve rounded a\nfew choice entrants up for you here.\n\n**Related:[iPhone XR](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-xr-release-\ndate-specs-price-3579137)**\n\n## **1\\. Apple Silicone Case – $39/£45**\n\n![Apple iPhone XS silicon\ncases](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nApple’s own silicone cases gives your iPhone a soft-touch finish, covering the\nsides and back of the phone’s body, including the hardware buttons. A rounded\ncut-out along the base leaves the speaker and microphone grilles, as well as\nthe Lightning port accessible, while the inside face is lined with a\nmicrofibre material to minimise scratches and scrapes.\n\nApple’s silicone case comes in nine different shades and the company also\nguarantees that it won’t impede wireless charging.\n\n**Related:[iPhone XS vs Samsung Galaxy\nS9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-xs-vs-galaxy-s9-3564946)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n###  Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\n## **2\\. Tech21 Pure – $39.95/£29.95**\n\n![iPhone X XS XS Max Tech21 Pure\ncase](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nTech21’s most basic clear cases, the Pure range, are made from ‘BulletShield’\nimpact-resistant material. They’ve been proven to protect an iPhone from drops\nof up to 10 feet and sport an ultra-thin profile to boot. They come in a range\nof transparent, UV-resistant finishes and colours.\n\n**Related:[iPhone XR vs iPhone XS vs iPhone XS\nMax](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-xr-vs-iphone-xs-max-vs-iphone-\nxs-3565104)**\n\nYou pay the same whether you’re buying for an iPhone XS or XS Max and they’re\nthin enough that they don’t interfere with wireless charging. The coloured\nfinishes work particularly well if you opt for a silver XS or XS Max, as the\nphone’s off-white back acts as a canvas to show off the case’s natural\ncolouring.\n\n## **3\\. Apple Leather Case – $49/£55**\n\n![Apple iPhone XS leather\ncases](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIf you’re after a touch more luxury, Apple’s leather-backed cases might fit\nthe bill. They cost a little more than the silicon options but they bring a\ntextured finish, metal hardware controls and the same microfibre lining as the\nsilicon case to the table.\n\nAvailable in eight different colours for both devices and wireless charging\nshouldn’t be affected.\n\n## **4\\. Mous Limitless 2.0 – From $49.99/£39.99**\n\n![Mous iPhone XS Limiteless 2.0\ncases](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nMaking a tough case attractive was the main M.O. behind Mous’ Limitless 2.0\ncase, which comes in a variety of finishes. These affect both the colour of\nthe impact-resistant body and the inlaid backing; which can be either carbon\nfibre, walnut, leather, bamboo or sea shell (think mother-of-pearl).\n\nThe body is a composite construction of polycarbonate and TPU, whilst the\ninside edge of each case is lined with the company’s proprietary impact-\nresistant AiroShock material for extra shock dissipation on impact. What’s\nmore, Mous’s cases feature an array of magnets on the back which work with the\ncompany’s case add-ons, ranging from various mounts to a cardholder and more.\n\n## **5\\. Tech21 Evo Luxe – $54.95/£39.95**\n\n![Tech21 iPhone XS Evo Luxe\ncases](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nA hardier and arguably more stylish aesthetic than Tech21’s Pure line, the Evo\nLuxe range features a woven mesh back for added grip and style. The case\nitself is rated to protect your iPhone from drops of up to 12 feet using the\ncompany’s own FlexShock material and it should still accommodate wireless\ncharging without issue.\n\nThe only downside seems to be limited colour options.\n\n## **6\\. Nodus Shell Case II – From $64.88/£49.99**\n\n![iPhone X XS XS Max Nodus Shell Case\nII](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nBritish case maker and leatherworkers Nodus have been making iPhone cases for\nyears and a variety of compatible options for both the iPhone XS and XS Max\nare already on the cards. The Shell Case II comes in an array of beautifully\ntextured and coloured finishes, all of which are shrouded in Italian leather.\n\nEach case features a microfibre lining, a shock-absorbing polycarbonate core\nand works with the company’s Micro Dock III technology too. Included in-box,\nyou can stick the adhesive back of the Micro Dock onto practically any flat\nsurface and thanks to the super strong magnets inside, simply snap you Nodus\ncase-laden iPhone XS or XS Max on and off as you please.\n\n**Related:[Apple Watch 4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-watch-\nseries-4-3487177)**\n\n## **7\\. Tech21 Evo Max – $39.95/£39.95**\n\n![Tech21 iPhone XS Evo Max\ncases](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nA Max for your Max? As the name implies, the Evo Max is the hardiest of\nTech21’s current iPhone XS and XS Max case lineup. Available in black or Deep\nBlue, the Evo Max features a sliding camera cover to ensure those lenses stay\nscratch-free, the composite FlexShock design protects from drops up to 14 feet\nand Tech21 even throws in a holster for good measure.\n\nWireless charging shouldn’t be affected when using this case either.\n\n**We’ll be adding to this list once the iPhone XS is available, so bookmark\nthis page for more.**\n\n"}
