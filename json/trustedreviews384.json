The\nsweeping changes made to the map mean that it’s almost unrecognisable, keeping\nthe core concept but remaking it anew for players to charge around in.\n\nRemy has restated that the aim is to provide two new maps and two new reworks\nwith each year moving forwards, claiming that the complexity of the maps has\nbecome one of the biggest barriers for new players looking to get into the\ngame.\n\n“All the maps that we want to rework are maps that are showing potential,”\nsays Remy. “We want a map that, when reworked, is going to be much more\nbalanced for adversarial multiplayer.”\n\n**Watch: Rainbow 6 Siege Grim Sky update**\n\n## A multiplayer-first approach\n\nRemy explains that when the game originally launched, the team designed the 20\nlaunch maps with several factors, including how the game would play in\nadversarial multiplayer, terrorist hunt and the game’s single player\nscenarios. However, two years after release, Remy says the biggest\nconsideration now is the multiplayer angle.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\n“Let’s be honest,” says Remy, “those single player missions, terrorist hunt,\nthey’re less important factors than the multiplayer experience, and the most\nimportant multiplayer mode is the bomb defusal, if we consider how most people\nare playing the game. Our decisions reflect that.”\n\nRemy refers to Hereford as an obvious choice for a rework as, in addition to\nbeing the first ever map developed for the game, it was a map with a single\nhuge flaw. “The only staircase was creating a major bottleneck,” Remy said.\n“We felt that we could bring the map up to date, and if we fixed the problem\nwith the staircase we could update the map to how it plays out now.”\n\n“We ask ourselves ‘how do people play 5v5 Siege? What is the best experience?’\nThat has helped us to refine and focus when it comes to choosing maps. We want\nmaps that we can make well balanced, maps that can be brought to the next\nlevel after a major rework.”\n\n**Related:[Best FPS games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/fps-\ngames-3526310) **\n\nFans of the Plane map however, could be left waiting. “As an example, maps\nlike Plane, they are always going to be difficult to rework. The layout of the\nmap, any way we look at it, is not what we call our typical Siege map. There’s\nnot enough room and space to actually have all of the roaming that we want to\nsee and want to have. So that is a map that is likely not going to see a\nrework, for instance.”\n\nRemy says the team like maps like Plane and that they’ll”100 per cent” be kept\nin, but that it’s not a map that is worth putting through a rework.\n\n**Which of Rainbox Six Seige’s maps do you think is most in need of a re-work?\nLet us know @TrustedReviews.**\n\n"}
