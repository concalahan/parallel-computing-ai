There’s no\nOnePlus 4 this year, but instead the OnePlus 5 takes things up another level\nwith a seriously packed spec sheet – and a higher price.\n\nThe headline feature here is an interesting dual-camera setup on the back, but\nin typical OnePlus fashion there’s a serious amount of power and the option of\na frankly ridiculous 8GB of RAM.\n\n## OnePlus 5 – Design\n\nThe OnePlus 5 is a really good-looking phone, but it’s not the most original.\nThe back reminds me of an slightly curvier matte-black [iPhone 7\nPlus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/iphone-7-plus-review), right down to the\ncamera arrangement, the blended antenna lines and even the flash. The front is\npretty much the same as those of the outgoing OnePlus 3 and 3T, which is no\nbad thing, but in a world of the [Essential\nPhone](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/essential-phone-rubin-release-date-\nprice-specs-features-modular-accessories) and [LG\nG6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/lg-g6-review) it feels a bit old-fashioned.\n\nOld-fashioned is acceptable in this case, though, because OnePlus has managed\nto make this phone so comfortable to hold and a pleasure to use. The curved\nback fits perfectly in your palm, while the 3D Gorilla Glass 5 on the front\nalso curves slightly. This multitude of curves make it super-slim, but also\neasy to fish up from a table.\n\nThe OnePlus 5 with its 5.5-inch display is a larger phone than the 5.8-inch\n[Samsung Galaxy S8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-s8-review),\nbut it’s smaller in all dimensions than the same-screen-size iPhone 7 Plus. It\ndoesn’t feel big, although I have become used to this size of phone now, and I\ncan reach all the elements of the screen with one hand.\n\n**Related:[Best Android phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-android-\nphones-1_round-up)  \n![cats 9](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \n**  \nPrevious OnePlus devices have felt great for their price, which tended to be\nbelow £350, but even though the OnePlus starts at £449 it still feels better\nbuilt than anything else in that price range. Everything is precisely cut, it\nfeels sturdy and there are really neat touches like the alert slider that sits\nabove the volume rocker. I know this has been a OnePlus staple, but I’m\nappreciating being able to quickly flip the phone into silent mode when it’s\nstill in my pocket more and more.\n\nThere’s a headphone jack and Dash Charge-capable\n[USB-C](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/usb-type-c-everything-you-\nneed-to-know) port on the bottom, along with a microphone and mono speaker,\nplus a dual-Nano SIM tray on the side. I’d have preferred a microSD slot, or a\nhybrid slot, but at least there’s a decent amount of base storage here.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Call of Cthulhu](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Call of Cthulhu\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/call-of-cthulhu \"Call of Cthulhu\")\n\n  * [ ![iPad Pro 2018](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: MySmartPrice / @OnLeaks \n\n### New iPad Pro 2018 leak shows Apple is almost certainly dropping the Home\nbutton\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ipad-pro-2018-release-date-specs-\nprice-3482812 \"New iPad Pro 2018 leak shows Apple is almost certainly dropping\nthe Home button\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Pete Lau on stage at the OnePlus 6T launch](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### The OnePlus 6T ditched the headphone jack, CEO Pete Lau tells us why\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ceo-pete-lau-oneplus-6t-headphone-jack-\nwireless-charging-3612475 \"The OnePlus 6T ditched the headphone jack, CEO Pete\nLau tells us why\")\n\n  * \n\nThe OnePlus 5 comes in two colours, though to be honest they look almost\nexactly the same. The 64GB model has 6GB RAM and comes in ‘Slate Grey’ while\nthe 128GB/8GB RAM version takes the ‘Midnight Black’ hue that was briefly\navailable on the OnePlus 3T. Both colours are deep, dark and matte, and it\nfeels odd to have two options so similar.\n\nThe lack of any sort of water-resistance rating is slightly disappointing, but\nnot a deal beaker yet.\n\n![cats 17](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## OnePlus 5 – Screen\n\nOnePlus has stepped up the game in the vast majority of areas this year, but\non paper at least the screen feels very much the same. It’s still a 5.5-inch\nAMOLED panel, which is still 1080p as opposed to the more common quad-HD\nresolution.\n\nThe OnePlus 3 (and 3T) suffered from a few annoying screen issues, including\npoor calibration and laggy scrolling, but the OnePlus 5 sorts these out. So\nthat’s a bonus straight away.\n\nThe display now covers the wide\n[DCI-P3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/monitor-colour-spaces-adobergb-\nsrgb) colour gamut, like the [iPhone\n7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-7-release-date-price-rumours-\nvideo-images-features-uk) and Galaxy S8, and this is my preferred colour\nprofile. It gives colours more of a punch, without oversaturating, and there’s\nmore variety in the shades. There’s an sRGB mode too that removes a bit of the\npunch, and a Default mode that feels to me a bit too colourful.\n\n**Related:[Best budget phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-cheap-\nmobile-phones_round-up)  \n![cats 13](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \n**  \nI would have liked to see a resolution bump, but in all honestly it’s tough to\npick out individual pixels unless you get really close. It’s not as sharp as\nthe [HTC U11](https://www.trustedreviews.com/htc-u11-review), nor is it as\nsharp as a 5-inch 1080p device, but colours are nice and because it’s AMOLED\nthere’s that extra depth to blacks that you don’t get with LCD.\n\nGorilla Glass 5 covers the panel and that should help prevent scratches, but I\nhave still found small hairline scratches appear on the display after a week\nof use.\n\n[ Next  \nPerformance and Software\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/oneplus-5-performance-and-software-\npage-2)\n\n"}
