So,\nfor example, if you order a coffee from the same place every morning, you’ll\nget a notification enabling you to complete the task right within Siri.\n\nLikewise, if Siri knows you’re running late for your next meeting based upon\nyour current location, it’ll suggest you text the organiser to let them know\nyou’re en route.\n\n**Related:[WWDC 2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/wwdc-2018-3399519)**\n\nIt’ll remind you to call your grandma on her birthday and, if it knows you’re\nat the movie theatre, it’ll ask whether you’d like to turn on the Do Not\nDisturb feature until you leave that location. If you have a Tile dongle\nattached to your keys, you can say “Hey Siri, I lost me keys” and it’ll\nactivate the Tile app.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Shortcuts has its own app\n\nHowever, the coolest part of the upgrade is the new customisable Shortcuts\napplication, which will be built into iOS 12. Effectively its an ‘If This Then\nThat’ tool that lets you group multiple commands in one.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nThe dedicated Shortcuts app will allow you to tie actions together under a\nvoice command like “heading home”.\n\nIn the demonstration on stage at WWDC 2018, Apple showed how that command\nenables users to set their HomeKit-enabled thermostat, turn on the fan, notify\nyour roommate of the ETA, load the route in Apple Maps, and play their\nfavourite radio show.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nLikewise, after tapping an ‘Add to Siri’ button from an app like Kayak, users\nwill simply be able to request travel plans from Siri to quickly load the\naddress of their hotel, for example.\n\nApple says there are hundreds of pre-made Shortcuts within the app’s gallery,\nwhich users can easily add to their library.\n\nHowever, it’s simple to to create your own or add features to the templates,\nfrom all of the first- and third-party apps they already have installed upon\nyour phone. Within the Shortcut editor you’ll also be able to drag the order\naround to choose which actions take place first.\n\nThe new Siri Shortcuts functionality will be available on iPhone,\n[iPad](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/ipad-2018),\n[HomePod](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/apple-homepod), [Apple\nTV](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/apple-tv-4k) and [Apple\nWatch](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/apple-watch-3).\n\n**Does this do enough to bring Siri in line with Amazon Alexa and Google\nAssistant?
