Our\ncloud engineers are building a game streaming network to unlock console-\nquality gaming on any device. Not only that, but we are dedicated to\nperfecting your experience everywhere you want to play, [whether] it’s on your\nXbox, your PC or your phone, and of course our hardware team, the same team\nthat delivered unprecedented performance with Xbox One X is deep into\narchitecting the next Xbox consoles where we will once again deliver on our\ncommitment to set the benchmark for console gaming.”\n\nThere’s a lot to unpack in there, so _Trusted Reviews_ has compiled everything\nyou need to know about the mysterious ‘Xbox Two.’\n\n**Related:**[ **Upcoming Xbox One\nGames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/upcoming-xbox-one-games)\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n## Xbox Two News – What’s being said about it?\n\nA new report by [Thurrott](https://www.thurrott.com/xbox/163896/details-\nmicrosofts-xbox-scarlett-game-streaming-service) shines the biggest light yet\non Microsoft’s future hardware plans, revealing the potential existence of two\nnew hardware models to come in 2020.\n\nAccording to Brad Sams, Scarlett encompasses a new family of Xbox devices\ndesigned around traditional hardware and streaming as a way of accessing a\nvast library of potential titles. Both of which are said to be planned for a\n2020 release.\n\nThe first of which will be a traditional console not dissimilar to the Xbox\nOne, sporting state-of-the-art specifications capable of handling all the\nlatest games. The second will be a cheaper box dubbed the ’Scarlett Cloud’ and\nis essentially a streaming box.\n\nThe report states that Scarlett Cloud will be capable of supporting controller\ninput, processing images, and collision detection, while everything else will\nbe handled by a Cloud Platform Microsoft believes will tackle long-dormant\nissues around network latency.\n\nScarlett Cloud is said to be further in development compared to the\ntraditional console, indicating that Microsoft is putting some serious\ninvestment into its cloud streaming technology.\n\nThis two-pronged approach to the next generation makes sense in a lot of ways,\nand Microsoft appears to be taking traditional hardware and future prospects\nvery seriously, as many companies believe streaming is the future for gaming.\n\nHow Microsoft plans to charge for its streaming library remains unknown,\nalthough we imagine it will possess a streaming model akin to Xbox Game Pass.\nThe service may even be converted into an on-demand service of sorts in the\ncoming years.\n\n**Related:[Resident Evil 2\nRemake](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/resident-evil-2-remake-release-\ndate-gameplay-news-3261369)**\n\n## Xbox Two – What is it?\n\nFundamentally, the Xbox Two is the successor to the Xbox One and will be the\nfourth generation of consoles from Microsoft.\n\nMost of what we know about the upcoming hardware comes from Phil Spencer’s\nannouncement at E3 2018, where interestingly he used the plural of the word\n“consoles”, indicating that Microsoft could launch more than one next-gen\nmachine like it has done with the [Xbox One\nX](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/xbox-one-x) and [Xbox One\nS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/xbox-one-s)?\n\nIn other words, it could be similar to what Apple does with its iPhone updates\nyear after year, where it releases a premium ‘Plus’ model alongside a normal\nmainstream model.\n\nThe big question will be how the two consoles will differ. The Xbox One X and\nXbox One S were released at a time when 4K TVs were still in the early stages\nof being adopted, so it made sense to have one model that ran games at 4K, and\nanother that was better suited to 1080p TVs.\n\nHowever, when the Xbox two is released, 4K TVs are likely to be much more\ncommonplace, so it might not make sense to release a console that’s still\nlimited to running games at Full HD.\n\nAt the moment, only Microsoft has answers to these questions.\n\n## Xbox Two release date – When could it be coming out?\n\nA potential release window for Xbox Two remains a mystery at the time of\nwriting. Console’s have historically worked on a six-year release cycle, and\nwith the Xbox One originally having released in 2013, that makes 2019 the\nobvious year for a followup.\n\nThat said, the release of the Xbox One X in 2017 has disrupted the usual\nrelease cycle. We’re in uncharted territory at the moment, meaning a 2020\nrelease or even later could be on the cards.\n\nThe current consensus is a 2020 release for the new console though, and we’d\nbe surprised if we didn’t see more details emerge at E3 2019.\n\n**Related:[Best Xbox One Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-xbox-\none-games-3435271)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Xbox Two games – What can we expect to play?\n\nAt the moment we have two high profile games that we definitely know are\ncoming to next-generation consoles, which means that they’ll presumably be\nmaking their way to the Xbox Two.\n\nBoth were announced by Bethesda on stage at its E3 2018 conference. One is a\nsci-fi game called [Starfield](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/starfield-\nrelease-date-3484396) and the other, [The Elder Scrolls\n6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/elders-scrolls-6-release-date-2993132),\nis the next entry in the long-running RPG series.\n\nBeyond these two games, we’re forced to speculate a little more about what\nmight be on its way. [Halo:\nInfinite](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/halo-infinite-release-\ndate-3484012) has been announced by Microsoft as the next big Halo game, but\nthe lack of any firm details has us thinking this might be a game set to\nlaunch on Microsoft’s next console.\n\nOutside of new games, it sounds like we might be set for another dose of [Xbox\nbackward compatibility](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/xbox-one-\nbackwards-compatibility-2993066). In a recent interview with Eurogamer,\nSpencer said: “I’m very proud of our track record of compatibility and us\nrespecting the purchase of games you’ve made with us and bringing that to the\ncurrent generation.”\n\nAlthough he stops short of confirming backward compatibility will continue\nonto the new console, the fact that he’s so proud of it, as well as saying,\n“It is our core on who we are”, certainly suggests he hopes it will continue\nwith the new console.\n\n**Related:[Cyberpunk\n2077](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/cyberpunk-2077-release-date-\ngameplay-trailer-2948412) **\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Xbox Two specs and features — How will it work?\n\nIn terms of the hardware, it’s possible we’ll see the Xbox Two embrace GDDR6\nmemory for its GPU. This was both\n[reported](https://www.thurrott.com/xbox/157090/xbox-after-the-x) by reliable\nMicrosoft insider Paul Thurrott, with further evidence being provided by a\n[recent](https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en/job/419789/Sr-Electrical-\nEngineer-DRAM-Memory-Lead-XBOX) job listing for the company. This is a\nstandard of memory that’s not even available for gaming PCs just yet.\n\nElsewhere, Spencer has indicated that the console will come packing similar\nvariable refresh rate technology to what we’ve seen roll out on the Xbox One.\nWith [HDMI 2.1](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/hdmi-2-1-spec-\nrevealed-10k-dynamic-hdr-3347921) including the tech as part of its spec, it’s\nlikely to become much more widespread in the future.\n\nStreaming is also likely to play a big part of the new console’s experience.\nIn Spencer’s E3 talk he made specific reference to a “game streaming network”\nwhich will “unlock console quality gaming on any device”. The obvious\napplication here is phones, but we’d surprised if Microsoft didn’t also use a\nlittle bit of this cloud computing power to enhance games that are already\nrunning on a console.\n\nFinally, Spencer’s mention of ‘gaming AI’ has us hopeful that we might see\nimprovements that aren’t just graphical. For years it’s felt like we’ve been\nplaying against NPCs with a very limited set of skills, and we’ll be very\nexcited to see this change.\n\n**Related:[Halo 6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/halo-6-release-\ndate-2993152) **\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Xbox Two wishlist – All the stuff we’d love to see\n\n**A stronger exclusive library**\n\nWhen it comes to big-name exclusives, Microsoft has been lagging behind the\nquality of Sony and Nintendo for some time. Of course, the likes of\n[Forza](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/forza-horizon-4-release-date-news-\ntrailer-gameplay-wishlist-cars-3382198),\n[Halo](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/halo-6-release-date-news-trailer-\ngameplay-preorder-xbox-one-x-2993152), and [Gears of\nWar](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/gears-of-war-5-news-release-date-\ntrailer-characters-beta-2949338) continue to impress, but they’re relatively\npredictable when it comes to the competition. Here’s hoping [Crackdown\n3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/crackdown-3) and [State of Decay\n2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/state-of-decay-2-release-date-gameplay-\nmultiplayer-coop-trailer-xbox-one-pc-2949448) rock the boat ahead of Xbox\nTwo’s arrival.\n\nBut even then, Sony has a list as long as your arm on PS4, with [God of\nWar](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/god-of-war-ps4), [The Last of Us\nPart 2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/last-of-us-2-release-date-\ngameplay-trailer-pre-order-news-wishlist-2944236), [Days\nGone](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/days-gone-release-date-gameplay-\ntrailer-pre-order-ps4-pro-2993135), [Spider-\nMan](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/spiderman-ps4-2993195), [Death\nStranding](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/death-stranding-release-\ndate-2947317) and so many more. Xbox has an awful lot of catching up to do\nthat could take them many years to even be in the conversation.\n\nMicrosoft announced the acquisition of a number of exciting studios at E3 2018\nincluding Hellblade developer Ninja Theory and Playground Games, so hopefully,\nthese new studios will be capable of developing the kinds of exclusives the\ncompany desperately needs.\n\n**Improved user interface**\n\nDespite going through multiple iterations since its 2013 launch, the Xbox One\ninterface can still feel finicky to use. The abandonment of Kinect meant that\nmenus originally designed with voice navigation in mind had to be redesigned\nfrom scratch, and this clearly wasn’t an easy task.\n\nSwitching from games to download to your friends’ list and back has never been\nthe most intuitive, and we’d love to see Xbox Two address deliver a fully\nfledged overhaul. The option for shortcuts to specific menus or an easier way\nto navigate each section would be great.\n\n**Related:**[ **Best Xbox One\nDeals**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-xbox-one-deals-2993078)\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**The return of voice control**\n\nThis one might prove to be a little controversial but we really liked the idea\nof Cortana voice control in theory. It was just a shame that in practice its\nKinect implementation ended up feeling a little clunky and inconvenient.\n\nWith recent rumours suggesting we might soon see the likes of [Alexa and\nGoogle Assistant on Xbox One](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/xbox-one-\nalexa-google-assistant-3480778) we’d be interested to see similar support on\nthe Xbox Two if only for the convenience of being able to launch games with\nour voice.\n\n**Take Play Anywhere to the next level**\n\nAs gamers that regularly play on both PC and console, we’ve been really\nenjoying Microsoft’s current Xbox Play Anywhere initiative. We’d love to see\nthem taken further for the next console, and embraced by more third-party\ngames and platforms.\n\nAt the moment, Xbox Play Anywhere is mainly concentrated on Microsoft’s own\ntitles, and you have to download and manage them through Microsoft’s own\ndigital store on PC. We’d love to see more publishers come on board to make\ntheir games compatible and to be able to manage the PC half of our library\nthrough the industry standard Steam marketplace.\n\n**What would you like to see from Microsoft’s next console?
