As part of the company’s ongoing\nefforts to make conversations more natural, users in bilingual homes will be\nable to speak two languages interchangeably.**\n\nGoogle says this is a ‘first of its kind’ feature that’ll be available on\nsmart speakers and phones with the Assistant on board. Currently, it supports\nany pair of English, German, French, Spanish, Italian and Japanese, with more\nlanguages in the coming months.\n\nIn a blog post on Thursday, Google writes: “If you’re looking for an answer in\nEnglish, ask, “Hey Google, what’s the weather like today?” If you’re craving\ntunes from your favorite German hip hop band, just ask “Hey Google, spiele die\nFantastischen Vier.”\n\n**Related:[Google Home review](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-\nhome)**\n\nUsers of the Google Assistant have always had the opportunity to change the\nnative language, but until now could only use one at a time. You can see the\nfeature in action in the video below:\n\nGoogle says the feature is underpinned by a new LangID language identification\nmodel, which it hopes to upgrade with trilingual capabilities in the future.\nIn an accompanying blog post the company explains how it works.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThe [firm writes](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/08/Multilingual-Google-\nAssistant.html): “To understand more than one language at once, multiple\nprocesses need to be run in parallel, each producing incremental results,\nallowing the Assistant not only to identify the language in which the query is\nspoken but also to parse the query to create an actionable command. For\nexample, even for a monolingual environment, if a user asks to “ _set an alarm\nfor 6pm_ ”, the Google Assistant must understand that “ _set an alarm_ ”\nimplies opening the clock app, fulfilling the explicit parameter of “ _6pm_ ”\nand additionally make the inference that the alarm should be set for today.\n\n“To make this work for _any given pair_ of supported languages is a challenge,\nas the Assistant executes the same work it does for the monolingual case, but\nnow must additionally enable LangID, and not just one but two monolingual\n[speech recognition systems](https://ai.googleblog.com/2015/08/the-neural-\nnetworks-behind-google-voice.html) simultaneously.”\n\nThe announcement comes in the same week, the Google launched the Home Max in\nthe UK market in the hope of challenging the Apple HomePod.\n\n**Will you be snapping up a Google Home Max?
