Doom running on\nan[Oscilloscope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZaKlLyikKg), Doom running on\na[ Macbook Pro’s Touch Bar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD0L46y3IqI), even\nDoom played on a [piano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJu997jwBcA). At\n_Trusted Reviews_ , we were sure we’d seen it all.**\n\nWe were wrong.\n\nThe video, the sole upload to channel ThatsAController, shows a modder wiring\na toy trumpet to play Doom, pushing through the first level with his\ninstrument of destruction.\n\nThis year-old video, spotted by Motherboard, is a fun nod to the ridiculous\nDoot meme that sees a Revenant from 2016’s Doom holding a trumpet. Better yet,\nwe get to watch a man dressed partially as Darth Vader completing the first\nlevel of Doom II by playing a toy trumpet.\n\nYou can move or interact with the environment using the four valves atop the\ntrumpet while blowing into the trumpet fires your weapon. It seems this method\nof controlling the game isn’t for the short of breath.\n\n**Did this put a smile on your face? Has it encouraged you to try and wire up\na Doom controller using a banana, or something similarly wild? Let us know on\nTwitter at @Trustedreviews**\n\n"}
