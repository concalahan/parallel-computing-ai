This\nmight seem an unnecessarily beefy spec, but the demands of on-the-go streaming\nand handset gaming aren‚Äôt going to lessen any time soon (quite the opposite)\nso we‚Äôre excited to see how this translates into real world performance.\n\n**Related:[Best Android phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nandroid-phones-3438996)**\n\n## Xiaomi Mi Mix 3: UK release date and price\n\n![Mi Mix\n3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nSecondly, and perhaps more importantly for the average user, is that a 5G Mi\nMix 3 is now confirmed for a 2019 European release. The UK might just about\nstill constitute part of Europe then, at least in the eyes of global marketing\nteams, so we‚Äôre pegging a UK Mi Mix 3 launch as more likely than not ‚Äì MWC\n2019 would be the obvious regional launchpad for the phone.\n\nFor sure we know that Xiaomi is launching its phones in the UK from November\n8. The firm has also confirmed it is opening its first UK store on November\n10, at the Westfield shopping centre in White City. It has promised a flagship\ndevice and maybe we‚Äôll see the smart home products and electric scooter?\n\n**Related:[When is Black Friday?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/when-\nis-black-friday-3582854)**\n\nPricing for the Mi Mix 3 starts at 3299 Chinese yuan, which directly converts\nto about ¬£365 at time of writing, for the base model with 6GB of RAM and 128GB\nof on-board storage. Additional cost details should be available soon, with\nIndia in particular understood to be one of the countries getting the Mi Mix 3\nfirst.\n\n**What are your early thoughts on the Xiaomi Mi Mix 3?
