It’s the best-looking phone\nI’ve ever seen, leaving every other handset trailing in its wake.\n\nThe curved rear, as seen on the Galaxy S7, nestles perfectly in your palm,\nwhile the glass shimmers as the light hits it. The device is available in\nthree colours – a dark black, bright silver and a grey with a blueish tinge –\nwith no ugly white front plate in sight.\n\nMy review unit is the black option, and it’s properly black all over, with\nshiny sides that blend into the display. It feels like one complete piece,\nwith the glass, screen and metal combining all together.\n\n**Related:[Best Android phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-android-\nphones-1_round-up)**  \n![galaxys8\n17](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe volume rocker and standby switch are joined by a new button on the side.\nThis is a dedicated Bixby button – which I’ll cover in more detail in the\nSoftware section – and while it shows Samsung is taking its new virtual\nassistant seriously, it feels too much for Bixby to have its own button.\n\nThe S8 is thin and incredibly light at 155g, but it feels sturdy and precisely\nmade. The last time Samsung opted for a huge change of direction with its\nflagship, many of the basic features were lost in the transition. Thankfully,\nthis isn’t the case here. A microSD slot continues to sit tucked away with the\nnano-SIM, the criminally underrated Qi wireless charging is also present, and\nthe device is IP68 water- and dust-resistant too, so it will survive a dunk in\nwater for 30 minutes to depths of 1.5 metres.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\n  * \n\nSamsung has also retained the headphone jack; I’d be very surprised to hear\nthat anyone thinks that’s a bad idea. Apple’s decision to remove a physical\nheadphone connection looked like it might signal the demise of the 3.5mm jack,\nbut Samsung has gone in the other direction, by including a pair of very good\nAKG wired buds in the box.\n\nLike the recently launched [LG\nG6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/lg-g6-review), the front of the Samsung\nGalaxy S8 is almost all screen – and it’s this that really makes the S8 stand\nout. Unlike with the G6, though, the display here melts into the sturdy metal\nrim.\n\n**Related:[Samsung Galaxy Tab S3\nreview](https://www.trustedreviews.com/galaxy-tab-s3-review)**  \n![galaxys8\n31](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIt’s a much subtler curve than on the Galaxy S7 Edge; far more like the ill-\nfated Galaxy Note 7 in fact, which makes it a lot easier to use. Accidental\ntouches were common on older Edge phones, with your hand hitting the screen\nwhen you were just holding the device, but I haven’t experienced this with the\nS8. There’s still a bit of extra reflection on this portion of the screen, but\nit’s a small trade-off for such an eye-catching look.\n\nAs with any phone, though, not everything is perfect. Having such a big\ndisplay and tiny bezel means there’s no room for the fingerprint-sensing Home\nbutton to sit on the front.\n\nInstead, it’s on the back, next to the camera, and I hate it more every time I\nuse it. First, it’s tiny, meaning those times I actually hit it, it doesn’t\nrecognise my finger. But its real issue is the positioning; it’s so\nunintuitive. You have to wiggle your finger around the camera – which,\nincidentally, throws up a message on opening the app to remind you to clean\ndirty smudges of the lens – and guess where the scanner is?\n\nI don’t understand why it isn’t at the centre, as it is every other phone that\nhas a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner. I suspect Samsung wanted to build it\ninto the display, but just ran out of time.\n\nI’m also not convinced about how well this phone will hold up after months and\nyears of use. The addition of Gorilla Glass 5 on both the front and back\nshould offer a little more protection, but I’ve ended up with both a cracked\nGalaxy S6 and Galaxy S7 after drops onto carpet from barely 2ft high.\nHopefully, things will be different with the Galaxy S8 – but it feels like a\ndelicate phone.\n\n![galaxys8\n5](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)_  \nThe strange position of the fingerprint scanner_\n\nThe phone is also prone to showing fingerprints, but that’s par for the course\nwith this amount of glass and shiny metal. I’d go with the Midnight Grey\ncolour option if you’re really averse to smudges.\n\n## Samsung Galaxy S8 – Screen\n\nNot only has Samsung crafted what is, in my opinion, the best-looking phone\nout there, but it’s slapped on the finest display too. Although, when you\nconsider that Samsung has demonstrated the best screen tech for a number of\nyears, this isn’t really a surprise.\n\nThere’s more to the display than just the curves. First, it has a new aspect\nratio of 18.5:9, rather than 16:9. This means it’s taller, essentially giving\nyou more space in a body that isn’t that much bigger than that of the S7.\nWhile the Galaxy S7 had a 5.1-inch display, the S8 bumps that to 5.8.\n\nIt sounds huge, but the phone itself is compact and Samsung is keen to point\nout that it can still be used comfortably in one hand. I wouldn’t say that you\ncan do quite ‘everything’ with one hand – especially reaching to pull down the\nnotification tray – but this is far from a phablet.\n\nThe 5.8-inch display size is in some ways deceiving, however. Don’t pick up\nthis phone thinking it will have the same size of screen as the Nexus 6P or\nHTC U Ultra in a much smaller body. This is a tall screen and it’s bigger than\nthe S7, but it’s much narrower than proper phablets. Width-wise, it’s barely\nwider than an iPhone 7 and noticeably narrower than the Pixel XL.\n\n**Related:[What is HDR?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/hdr-tv-high-\ndynamic-television-explained)**  \n![galaxys8\n25](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nLike the majority of Samsung phones, the panel is AMOLED and has a slightly\nodd quad-HD+ 2960 x 1440 resolution. It’s also ‘Mobile HDR Premium’ certified,\nso you’ll be able to stream HDR (high dynamic range) shows from Amazon Prime\nand Netflix when those apps are updated. Arguably, [HDR is the most important\nevolution in TV tech](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/hdr-tv-high-\ndynamic-television-explained) is recent years, offering better contrast and a\nbrighter picture.\n\nColours are gloriously vivid, but it manages to avoid oversaturating brighter\nshades while still displaying the deepest black. Like the iPhone 7, it covers\nthe DCI-P3 cinema-grade colour gamut for a much wider spectrum of colours, and\nin certain situations, the brightness can break the 1000-nit barrier.\nConsidering most phones, including the LG G6, only go up to about 650 nits,\nthis is seriously impressive stuff. In fact, this screen is so bright that I\ncan keep it on 25% brightness and it’s perfectly visible indoors.\n\n### Best Samsung Galaxy S8 deals – 10-30GB of data\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=6224&clickref=TR-S8Deals&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fonehouse.co.uk%2Fshoppingcart.aspx%3Fhtrid%3D167090%26gid%3D0%26colid%3D904%26isnew%3D0%26IsPreOrder%3Dbuy%2520now)\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=6224&clickref=TR-S8Deals&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fonehouse.co.uk%2Fshoppingcart.aspx%3Fhtrid%3D167090%26gid%3D0%26colid%3D904%26isnew%3D0%26IsPreOrder%3Dbuy%2520now)\n\n###\n\n[Samsung Galaxy S8 64GB Black – 30GB, £30/month (after cashback) with no\nupfront on EE\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=6224&clickref=TR-S8Deals&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fonehouse.co.uk%2Fshoppingcart.aspx%3Fhtrid%3D167090%26gid%3D0%26colid%3D904%26isnew%3D0%26IsPreOrder%3Dbuy%2520now)\n\nGetting a whopping 30GB of data with no upfront cost is one thing, but signing\nup with EE also gets you three free months of BT Sport plus six months free of\nApple Music.

Most people probably won’t notice the difference – and\nthat’s fine. But I’d suggest hopping into Settings and switching things up.\nDownscaling can leave some apps with oddly big fonts and a softer look on\ntexts and icons; considering you’re spending £600/$700+ on a phone, you’ll\nprobably want it to look its best.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S8 is the best phone out there for media binging, and I’ve\nstarted picking it up instead of my iPad when I want to watch something on the\ngo. There’s a clever mode called ‘Video Enhancer’, which boosts the contrast\nand brightness in certain apps – Netflix, Prime Video, YouTube and so on – to\ngive a pseudo-HDR effect. I wouldn’t recommend keeping it on all the time, due\nto the increased battery drain, but it does make a fantastic display even\nbetter.\n\n**Related:[Best Amazon Prime Day Deals\n2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-amazon-prime-\nday-2018-deals-3482743)**\n\n[ Next  \nPerformance and Software ](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-\ngalaxy-s8-performance-and-software-page-2)\n\n"}
