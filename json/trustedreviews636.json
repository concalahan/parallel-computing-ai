If\nyou’re looking at a Panasonic TV and you don’t know what all the numbers mean,\nwe’ve got you covered. Here’s all you need to know before you buy one.**\n\nWhat follows is a comprehensive breakdown of the entire 2018 Panasonic TV\nlineup. I was lucky enough to get a sneak peek in January at [CES\n2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ces-2018-best-highlights-\nnews-3350586), where the Panasonic FZ950 and FZ800 series 4K OLED models were\nunveiled. Here is everything else, but first here are some things you ought to\nknow.\n\n## Five things you should know about Panasonic TVs in 2018\n\n  1. Hollywood uses Panasonic’s OLED TVs. The Panasonic EZ1000 OLED was not only tuned by professional studio colourists, it is used at many Hollywood post-production facilities to colour-grade films. That means you can buy the very model of TV that was used to work on some of the biggest recent releases, such as Wonder Woman.\n  2. Every model released in 2018 will be compatible with high dynamic range – even the lower-end HD ones. Last year, Sony was the only company to do this, and I’m glad to see Panasonic is doing it too. It makes sense: HDR is a more impactful upgrade than 4K resolution in many ways, and we’re now seeing more non-4K HDR content. Star Trek Discovery is a recent example.\n  3. The 4K models not only support HDR, they support HDR10+, which uses dynamic metadata to optimise the HDR performance scene by scene. Amazon Prime Video is a supporter of HDR10+, along with 20th Century Fox.\n  4. All of the LED LCD models are edge-lit designs, and most of those (in 43, 49 and 55 inches) use IPS panels.\n  5. The company is 100 years old in 2018. Happy birthday, Panasonic.\n\n**Related:[Best 4K TVs](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-4k-tvs)  \n**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nNow let’s look at some 2018 TVs. I’ll leave my 2017 coverage at the bottom of\nthis article, as many of those models are still in shops.\n\nA quick way to decipher these numbers is as follows: Panasonic is using ‘FZ’\nto label this year’s top TVs, the 4K OLED models. ‘FX’ is for the 2018 4K LED\nLCD models, a step down in the range. ‘FS’ is for the lower tier models going\nup to 1080p. All of the 2018 models can be identified by the ‘F’ in the model\nnumber, so it follows that ‘E’ is for 2017 and anything labelled ‘D’ is from\n2016.\n\n**John Lewis Deal:[Enjoy the World Cup with this stunning range of Panasonic\nTVs](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1203&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-\nTVWorldcup&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnlewis.com%2Fbrand%2Fview-all-\ntvs-800005013%2Fpanasonic%2Ffx750%2F_%2FN-474pZ1z140zjZ1yzvg4r%3F)**\n\n## Panasonic 2018: 4K Ultra HD OLED TVs\n\n![Panasonic OLED\n2018](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Panasonic EZ1000 series – 77 inches**\n\n  * Panasonic TX-77EZ1002\n\nThe EZ1000 series was Panasonic’s top model of 2017, and it’s still so good it\nwill continue to be sold into 2018 – albeit only at the largest size of 77\ninches. The EZ1000 isn’t only tuned by Hollywood, it is used by Hollywood\nprofessionals. So if colour accuracy is your thing, this model is hard to\nbeat. It’s also armed with a Technics-tuned soundbar, so it’s not just the\npicture that’s worth shouting about. Read our review of the 65-inch version\nbelow.\n\n**Review:[Panasonic\nTX-65EZ1002](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/panasonic-ez1002)**\n\n**![Panasonic\nFZ950](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)**\n\n**Panasonic FZ950 series – 55 and 65 inches**\n\n  * Panasonic TX-55FZ952\n  * Panasonic TX-65FZ952\n\nThe Panasonic FZ950 series is the successor to the EZ1000. Aesthetically it’s\na very similar offering: you get a Technics-tuned soundbar and the Absolute\nBlack filter for minimising reflections and unwanted ambient light.\n\nUnder the hood, the improvements are more subtle. The new panel is similar,\nbut processing is better optimised, resulting in a brighter picture. Dark\nperformance has been improved too, with more precise control over shadow\ndetail than before, even at extremely low black levels. The soundbar isn’t\nmore powerful than on the EZ1000, but it sounds richer.\n\n**Read the review:[Panasonic\nFZ950/FZ952](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/panasonic-\nfz950-fz952-oled)**\n\n**![Panasonic OLED TV\nFZ800](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)**\n\n**Panasonic FZ800 series – 55 and 65 inches**\n\n  * Panasonic TX-55FZ802\n  * Panasonic TX-65FZ802\n\nThis is literally what happens when you take the FZ950 series and replace the\nsoundbar stand with a regular plinth stand. Other than that, the specs and\nperformance are identical. A good way to save some cash if you have an\nexisting sound system and don’t need audio reinforcement.\n\n****\n\n## Panasonic 2018: 4K Ultra HD LED LCD TVs\n\n![Panasonic LED TV FX750\nFX780](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Panasonic FX750 series (FX780 in Europe) – 49, 55, 65 and 75 inches**\n\n  * Panasonic TX-49FX750\n  * Panasonic TX-55FX750\n  * Panasonic TX-65FX750\n  * Panasonic TX-75FX750\n\nThis is the premium LED LCD model in the range. Why is it premium? Firstly\nthere is the fancy ‘Art & Interior’ design, which translates to a one-sheet\nglass body and a minimalist central plinth. (The 75-inch one doesn’t get that–\nit’s too big for glass and uses a lot of metal instead.)\n\nThen there’s the fact that it shares the same HCX processor found in the\nflagship OLED models – that means some gorgeous colours and good contrast\nmanagement.\n\n### John Lewis World Cup TV Deal\n\n[](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1203&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-\nTVWorldcup&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnlewis.com%2Fpanasonic-tx-65fx750b-led-\nhdr-4k-ultra-hd-smart-tv-65-inch-with-freeview-play-freesat-hd-art-glass-\ndesign-black%2Fp3540281%3FsearchTerm%3D65FX750)\n\n[](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1203&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-\nTVWorldcup&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnlewis.com%2Fpanasonic-tx-65fx750b-led-\nhdr-4k-ultra-hd-smart-tv-65-inch-with-freeview-play-freesat-hd-art-glass-\ndesign-black%2Fp3540281%3FsearchTerm%3D65FX750)\n\n###\n\n[Panasonic TX-65FX750B 65\" LED HDR 4K Ultra HD | Now £1,999.99\n\n](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1203&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-\nTVWorldcup&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnlewis.com%2Fpanasonic-tx-65fx750b-led-\nhdr-4k-ultra-hd-smart-tv-65-inch-with-freeview-play-freesat-hd-art-glass-\ndesign-black%2Fp3540281%3FsearchTerm%3D65FX750)\n\nThis gorgeous 4K HDR TV with Art Glass Design is Ultra HD certified for the\nultimate in picture quality.

These are all\nedge-lit models, which use a combination of physical zonal dimming and\nsoftware-based digital dimming. The FX750 gets better digital dimming than the\nmodels below it. Oh, and this is the only LED LCD model with a native 100Hz\npanel.  \n![Panasonic LED\nFX740](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \n\n**Panasonic FX740 series – 49, 55 and 65 inches**\n\n  * Panasonic TX-49FX740\n  * Panasonic TX-55FX740\n  * Panasonic TX-65FX740\n\nThe FX740 series looks nearly identical to the FX750, but it loses out on the\nadvanced digital dimming and the HCX processor. That means its contrast and\ncolours won’t be quite as good, although it supports the same wide colour\nspectrum as all the models above it. This model and those below it use a\nnative 50Hz panel.\n\nIn the UK, the Panasonic FX740 series is exclusive to Currys.\n\n**Related:[Best TVs](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-tv)**\n\n**![Panasonic LED TV\nFX700](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)**\n\n**Panasonic FX700 series – 49, 55, and 65 inches**\n\n  * Panasonic TX-49FX700\n  * Panasonic TX-55FX700\n  * Panasonic TX-65FX700\n\nWe’re now far enough down the range that the ‘Art & Interior’ fancy design\nquirks no longer apply. The glass body has been swapped for a more\nconventional one that uses metal. The central pedestal is no more, and instead\nyou get separate feet. Thankfully those feet can be repositioned: set them far\napart if you have a wide bench, or put them at the centre if you don’t.\n\n![Panasonic FX600\nseries](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Panasonic FX650 series – 43, 49, 55 and 65 inches**\n\n  * Panasonic TX-43FX600\n  * Panasonic TX-49FX650\n  * Panasonic TX-55FX650\n  * Panasonic TX-65FX650\n\nNow we enter ‘entry-level’ territory for the 4K Ultra HD models. You still get\nthe switchable feet, but you lose the local dimming. Instead, this set will\nuse an ‘adaptive backlight dimming’, which essentially adjusts the brightness\nand contrast depending on the content.\n\n****\n\n## Panasonic 2018: Full HD and HD-ready LED LCD TVs\n\n**![Panasonic HD TV\n2018](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)**\n\n**Panasonic FS500 series – 24, 32, 40 and 49 inches**\n\n  * Panasonic TX-24FS500\n  * Panasonic TX-32FS503\n  * Panasonic TX-40FS503\n  * Panasonic TX-49FS503\n\nAs much as I love talking about massive 4K TVs, the smaller HD TV market is\nstill going strong. This is a good option if you’re not fussed about chasing\nthe latest specs or if you want a second TV in the home. This model is pretty\nbasic, but it does at least offer smart TV, with Netflix supposed to boot up\nin 10 seconds.\n\nOnly the 40- and 49-inch versions are Full HD (1080p). The 24- and 32-inch\nones are HD-ready (720p).\n\n**Related:[Best cheap TVs](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-cheap-\ntvs)**\n\n**Panasonic FS400 series – 32 and 40 inches**\n\n  * Panasonic TX-32FS400\n  * Panasonic TX-40FS400\n\nHere we have the bottom of the entire range.

It’s the\ncompany’s second OLED, the follow-up to the hugely successful CZ952 from 2015.\nIt has double the peak brightness, going up to 1000 nits. It uses Panasonic’s\ntop-tier Studio Colour HCX2 processor, which is accurate enough to be used in\na Hollywood colour grading environment. Its Absolute Black filter absorbs\nstray ambient light and minimises reflections, and it also has a speaker bar\ntuned by Panasonic’s Technics division._  \n_**  \nRead our verdict:[Panasonic TX-65EZ1002\nreview](https://www.trustedreviews.com/panasonic-tx-65ez1002-review)**_\n\n_![Panasonic\nEZ952](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)Panasonic EZ952_\n\n**_Panasonic TX-65EZ952 / TX-55EZ952_**\n\n_In a surprise move, Panasonic announced it has a second OLED up its sleeve.\nThe EZ952 is very similar to the EZ1002: it uses the same panel and the same\nStudio Colour HCX2 processor. It doesn’t have the Absolute Black filter and\nsoundbar base, though. Perhaps most importantly, this range sees Panasonic\noffer OLED in a more accessible 55-inch variant._\n\n_**Read our verdict:[Panasonic TX-65EZ952\nreview](https://www.trustedreviews.com/panasonic-ez952-review)**_\n\n**_Panasonic TX-65DX902 / TX58DX902 / TX-58DX802 / TX-50DX802_**\n\n_The DX902 and DX802 series were the top two performers in Panasonic’s 2016\nlineup.

The EX750 is the top model of\nthis middle tier. It has a peak brightness of around 550 nits, but it also\nuses the same Studio Colour HCX2 processor found in the premium OLED models._\n\n_It is an edge-lit LCD – none of Panasonic’s 2017 4K TVs are direct lit. It\nuses a new local dimming approach: local dimming tends to involve splitting\nthe lighting into zones to separate the light and dark areas, but Panasonic\nsays it has found a way to manipulate the LCD panel itself and limit light\nbleeds. The idea is to maximise the level of contrast you’d typically get from\nan LCD TV._\n\n_The EX750 has a curious ‘Swivel and Lift’ design, which does exactly as it\nsuggests. You’ll be able to adjust the TV’s height and the direction it faces.\nWell, the 58-inch and 50-inch versions, anyway. The 65-inch version only has\nthe swivel element and the 75-inch version doesn’t move at all._\n\n_Last and least: the EX750 is the only model in the entire range to support\n3D. It uses the active shutter system. Demand for 3D has dwindled to the point\nwhere most manufacturers just don’t bother any more, but you may want to look\nat this model if you’ve invested heavily in 3D Blu-rays._\n\n_**Check out our verdict:[Panasonic EX750\nreview](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/panasonic-ex750b)**_\n\n_![Panasonic\nEX700](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)Panasonic EX700_\n\n**_Panasonic TX-65EX700 / TX-58EX700 / TX-50EX700 / TX-40EX700_**\n\n_The EX700 is a step down from the EX750 and doesn’t get quite as bright –\naround 350 nits, I’m told. It loses out on its big brothers’ Studio Colour\nHCX2 processor but keeps the same local dimming tech as the EX750. It’s still\ncapable of a wide colour spectrum, however, and promises 90% of the DCI colour\nspectrum._\n\n_It doesn’t have the fancy lift and swivel stand, instead settling on flexibly\npositioned metal feet. You have them face forwards or backwards, depending on\nyour brand of interior design. More importantly, you can position them near\nthe centre or near the corners of the TVs, which is good for people without\nmassive bench-style AV racks._\n\n_![Panasonic\nEX600](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)Panasonic EX600_\n\n**_Panasonic TX-65EX600 / TX-55EX600 / TX-49EX600 / TX-40EX600_**\n\n_This is the entry level for 4K. The EX600 has the same brightness as the\nEX700 – about 350 nits – but loses out on on the advanced local dimming tech.\nYou also lose out on the wide colour spectrum._\n\n_So why would you consider this series? Well this is the first time Panasonic\nhas brought the larger screen sizes lower down in the range, and that means\nyou can have more pixels for less._\n\n_As with the EX700, the EX600 offers flexible stand positioning._\n\n_![Panasonic\nES500](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)Panasonic ES500_\n\n**_Panasonic TX-49ES500 / TX-40ES500 / TX-32ES500 / TX-24ES500_**\n\n_That’s it for 4K and HDR. These models offer standard dynamic range and only\ngo up to 1080p. But this end of the market is still healthy and these models\nmake for great second TVs, especially if you want a more affordable one for\nthe bedroom._\n\n_These are LED LCD panels, and they are all Full HD 1080p – except for the\n32-inch models and smaller which are HD-ready at 768p._\n\n_![Panasonic\nES400](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)Panasonic ES400_\n\n**_Panasonic TX-49ES400 / TX-40ES400 / TX-32ES400_**\n\n_The ES400 is very similar to the ES500, but the key difference is panel\nspeed. Panasonic says the ES500 has a backlight motion rate of 600Hz – but\n400Hz for the ES400._\n\n_Both of them offer internet connectivity and smart TV, which is nice because\nthe bottom models often get passed over for this sort of thing._\n\n**  \nWhich new Panasonic telly tickles your fancy?
