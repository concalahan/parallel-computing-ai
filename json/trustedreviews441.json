New skins! Much like Drift\nand Ragnarok before them, this season’s battle pass introduces two new skins\nwhich can be upgraded with XP.\n\nThe first you’ll unlock at Tier 1, **Calamity** , is a cowgirl who gains extra\nclothing options and a sweet aura when maxed. At the other end of the scale,\nthis season’s Tier 100 offering, **Dire** , is a human who evolves into a\nwerewolf, complete with different colour options.\n\nUnfortunately, there isn’t a quick way to gain XP. Your best bet is complete\nevery week’s challenges while making sure to always complete your dailies.\nDaily challenges may not seem like a lot of XP, but added up over the 69-day\nperiod, it amounts to a decent chunk. So even if they make you want to cry,\nstick with them. It’ll be worth it in a few months.\n\nAnd don’t forget, once you’ve unlocked the base skin for each character,\nyou’ll be able to level them up even after the season ends. So if you don’t\nmax them out, don’t worry. You won’t be time-gated from unlocking their final\nforms.\n\n_Trusted Reviews_ has compiled all of the information you need on Fortnite\nSeason 6 skins including weekly challenges, required experience and more.\n\n**Related:[Best Gaming Keyboard](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\ngaming-keyboard-3500376)**\n\n## How to Complete the Calamity Skin\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n  * Gain 20,000XP – Cowgirl Outfit + Mask\n  * Gain 50,000XP – Leather Jacket\n  * Gain 90,000XP – Poncho\n  * Gain 140,000XP – Long Coat\n  * Gain 200,000XP – Smoke and neon effect\n\nYou can also unlock different coloured headbands for Calamity’s hat.\n\n  * Complete 10 Weekly Challenges 0/10 Green Band\n  * Complete 25 Weekly Challenges 0/25 Purple Band\n  * Complete 50 Weekly Challenges 0/50 Black Band\n\nCompleting any five of the above challenges unlocks the Reckoning pickaxe.\n\n**Related:[Best Gaming Headset](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\ngaming-headsets-3431813)**\n\n## How to Complete the Dire Skin\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n  * Tier 100 – Human Dire Skin\n  * Gain 30,000 XP – Teenwolf-style skin\n  * Gain 70,000 XP – Brown werewolf skin\n  * Gain 120,000 XP – White wolf with blue headband skin\n  * Gain 180,000 XP – White wolf with orange headband skin\n  * Gain 250,000 XP – Black wolf skin\n\nIf you’re looking to unlock these awesome skins as quick as possible, you may\nwant to [check out our Season 6 week 1 guide to grab those much-needed battle\nstars](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/fortnite-guide-how-to-complete-the-\nseason-6-week-1-challenges-3594101).
