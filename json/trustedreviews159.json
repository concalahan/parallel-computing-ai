Both [LG](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-\ntipped-to-battle-snapdragon-with-high-end-mobile-chip) and\n[Samsung](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-s6-review) are\nproducing handsets with custom-built chipsets.\n\nIt’s worth noting that Google has never worked with Huawei on a Nexus device\nbefore, so it will be interesting to see what the Chinese OEM can muster up.\n\nThe last round of Nexus devices – the [Nexus\n6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/nexus-6-review) and [Nexus\n9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/nexus-9-review) – were both met with chilly\nreception, described as underwhelming by many critics.\n\nGoogle will almost certainly make a much greater effort to wow consumers with\nthe next batch of Nexus wares.\n\n"}
