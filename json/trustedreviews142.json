With a resin refill for one of RBR’s 3D printers costing as\nmuch as £60,000, it is currently a cheaper but far from wallet friendly option\nthan jumping straight to carbon fibre.\n\nUntil 3D printers are developed enough to be able to utilise more robust\nmaterials, the use of 3D printing within F1 will remain locked firmly in the\ndevelopment processor. According to Red Bull, however, this future is being\nseriously looked at and could be a reality sooner rather than later.\n\nIf Red Bull is looking to 3D printing as the future of the sport though, who\nare we to argue?\n\nNext, read about the [Red Bull Racing themed Ultimate Ears Boom\nspeaker](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ultimate-ears-boom-given-red-\nbull-racing-f1-makeover).\n\n"}
