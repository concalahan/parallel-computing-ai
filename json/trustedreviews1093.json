It’s out with black, coral and teal, and in with onyx\n(black), ruby (red), and sapphire (blue). You can also choose between Midnight\n(dark) and Twilight (light) lens shades.\n\nSnapchat’s second-gen specs are slightly slimmer too, which helps the frame-\nmounted electronics stand out less. The blinking lights that indicate you’re\nrecording give the game away though.\n\nThe charging case they’re sold alongside hold enough power for four full\ncharges. It’s also got the splash-proof treatment and lost a bit of bulk,\nwhich should make it easier for users to squeeze them into a bag and carry\nthem around.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nOnce again, Snaps are captured in a circular format, but this time Snapchat\nhas upped image quality, to 1216 x 1216 for videos and 1642 x 1642 for\npictures.

However, they’re only\navailable in black, and the frame shapes are very different.\n\nThe Veronica model features a butterfly frame, while the Nico model is much\nmore angular, and in truth looks a little like those 3D glasses they hand out\nat the cinema.\n\nFurthermore, the Nico and Veronica models both feature polarised lenses, which\nmeans they should provide more protection from glare, and they come with a\nnew, “semi-soft” protective case the the firm says is “optimised for\nportability”.\n\n“Lenses for Spectacles 2 (Nico, Veronica) are tinted and polarized to provide\n100% UVA/UVB protection. They also come in a standard Category 3, meaning that\nthey provide a high level of sun glare reduction, as well,” Snapchat\n[says](https://support.spectacles.com/hc/en-\nus/articles/360001298103-Spectacles-Lenses).\n\n**Read more:[Best iPhone](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\niphone-3501342)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Snapchat Spectacles 2: Price and release date\n\nSnapchat Spectacles 2 cost £149.99, a £20 increase on the originals, and\nthey’re available to purchase [here](https://www.spectacles.com/uk/features).\n\nNico and Veronica, meanwhile, are available for £199.99.
