While the Amazon Echo took an early lead by virtue of being released\nfirst, Google has upped its game for its Home range of speakers. Now, with the\nEcho on its second generation, which one is best for you?\n\n_Google has just revealed the latest addition to its range of smart home\ngadgets, the[Google Home Hub](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-home-\nhub-uk-release-date-price-3583109). Stay tuned for more on the new arrival, or\nread on to see how the original Google Home compares to the Amazon Echo._\n\n## Google Home vs Amazon Echo – Versions and price\n\nWhile we’re looking at the main Echo and Google Home speakers in this article,\nit’s worth thinking about how you may want to kit your home out for future\nuse. Amazon has the biggest range of smart speakers. The [Echo\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/amazon-echo)is the all-rounder, which\ncosts £90, down from the original’s £150. If you want a smaller speaker, the\ntiny [Echo Dot](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-\ngen) costs £50, making it cheap enough to fill your home with. Its sound isn’t\ngreat if you want something for music, but you can use Bluetooth or the 3.5mm\naudio jack to hook it up to a better set of speakers.\n\nFor smart home enthusiasts, there’s the new [Echo\nPlus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/amazon-echo-plus) (£140), which\nhas a built-in Zigbee hub for controlling devices, such as Philips Hue bulbs.\nIt’s a great idea in theory, but it’s not quite ready for the primetime.\n\nThen, there’s the [Echo Show](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/amazon-\necho-show), (£200) which adds a touchscreen to the Echo, so you interact with\nthe assistant in a completely different way, and view visual content, such as\na security camera’s feed.\n\n**Buy Now:[Google Home at Tesco from\n£129](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7090&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-\ntescocampaign&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tesco.com%2Fdirect%2Fgoogle-home-smart-home-\nvoice-assistant-speaker-white%2F255-8980.prd%3FskuId%3D255-8980)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nGoogle has a growing number of products. The original [Home\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-home)is the main product,\nwhich competes against the Echo in terms features and price (£89). Then,\nthere’s the [Google Home Mini](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-\nhome-mini) (£50), which competes with the Echo Dot and is cheap enough to\nspread throughout your home. This product doesn’t have any audio outputs, so\nyou can’t connect it easily to an external hi-fi system (well, not without\nthis handy [Google Home 3.5mm audio jack\nhack](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/diy-mod-gives-google-home-mini-\nfeature-along-3354102), that is). There’s also the [Google Home\nMax](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-home-max), a music-focussed\nspeaker. Google has launched the Google Home Hub a smart display that competes\nwith the Echo Show, plus there are third party models coming, too (reviews\ncoming soon).\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAmazon still slitghtly wins on total range, but Google has closed the gap\nconsiderably since launch.\n\nBoth companies are also working with external partners, launching a series of\nsmart speakers powered by the voice assistant. We’ve already seen the\nexcellent Alexa-powered [Sonos\nOne](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sonos-one), but there’s a range of\nother products on the way, such as the Harmon Kardon Allure. Google is\nfollowing suit, with the Sony LF-S50G and [Panasonic SC-\nGA10](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/panasonic-sc-ga10) among others.\n\n[](https://www.johnlewis.com/amazon-echo-smart-speaker-with-alexa-voice-\nrecognition-control-2nd-generation/p3348223)\n\n[](https://www.johnlewis.com/amazon-echo-smart-speaker-with-alexa-voice-\nrecognition-control-2nd-generation/p3348223)\n\n###\n\n[Amazon Echo Smart Speaker with Alexa Voice Recognition & Control, 2nd\nGeneration\n\n](https://www.johnlewis.com/amazon-echo-smart-speaker-with-alexa-voice-\nrecognition-control-2nd-generation/p3348223)\n\nGet the Amazon Echo now for £89.99\n\n[John Lewis\n\n](https://www.johnlewis.com/amazon-echo-smart-speaker-with-alexa-voice-\nrecognition-control-2nd-generation/p3348223)\n\n[View Deal](https://www.johnlewis.com/amazon-echo-smart-speaker-with-alexa-\nvoice-recognition-control-2nd-generation/p3348223)\n\n[John Lewis\n\n](https://www.johnlewis.com/amazon-echo-smart-speaker-with-alexa-voice-\nrecognition-control-2nd-generation/p3348223)\n\n[](http://www.argos.co.uk/product/6838331)\n\n[](http://www.argos.co.uk/product/6838331)\n\n###\n\n[Google Home\n\n](http://www.argos.co.uk/product/6838331)\n\nGet the Google Home now for £129.00\n\n[Argos\n\n](http://www.argos.co.uk/product/6838331)\n\n[View Deal](http://www.argos.co.uk/product/6838331)\n\n[Argos\n\n](http://www.argos.co.uk/product/6838331)\n\n**Related:[Google Assistant\nGuide](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/google-asssistant-guide-\nfeatures-entertainment-smart-home-and-more-3462823)**\n\n## Google Home vs Amazon Echo – Design\n\nBoth the Amazon Echo and Google Home are voice-controlled speakers, which you\ncan shout at without using your hands. While Google used to win the design\nbattle, the second-generation Amazon Echo ups the stakes.\n\nWhereas the first Echo was a little basic and industrial looking, Amazon as\nmade the new smart speaker far more attractive, and there’s now a choice of\nsix finishes: three material, two wood and a metallic choice. This makes it\nfar easier to find the product that suits your home decor.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe Google Home remains a good looker. It has a curvier shape, which Google\nsays was inspired by wine glasses and candles. Its bottom casing can be\nswapped out for different shells to match your furnishings – there are six\nshells, available in fabric or metal. It has a sloped top, with four LEDs to\nprovide visual feedback.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAmazon’s approach is entirely mechanical, with physical buttons for mute,\nactivation and volume. Arguably, the volume controls have been downgraded from\nthe original’s rotating dial. Google has gone for a capacitive touch panel, so\nyou’ll be swiping to control your music, but there is a physical mute button\nat the back.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nBoth units have microphones with far-field technology, which promises to pick\nup your voice from across the room or down the hallway.\n\n## Google Home vs Amazon Echo – Voice assistant\n\nThe Amazon Echo features the Alexa digital assistant, while the Google Home is\nloaded with the imaginatively named Google Assistant.\n\nAlexa is capable of understanding simple commands, or even a series of simple\ncommands, but they’re fairly basic. And the default search engine is Bing.\nAlexa also requires you to phrase things in a particular way for her to\nunderstand you, and the language you have to use is not always natural.\n\nAmazon’s other problem is that it’s one wake-up word (Alexa, by default, but\nyou can choose to have Echo, Amazon or Computer) means that the voice\nassistant often wakes up by mishearing what you’ve said.\n\nBy contrast, Google Assistant has the distinct advantage of, well, Google. As\nsuch, Assistant doesn’t just have a wealth of information – it’s built right\ninto Google’s overall architecture. Tell Google Home your shopping list and\nAssistant will be able to reproduce that in your Pixel phone later. And, by\nusing a two-word wake-up phrase, Google Home goes off less often by accident.\n\nGoogle Assistant also boasts two-way conversation based on Google’s own\nnatural language processing algorithm. Assistant is context-aware, so\nconversation should be more natural and less like a stilted list of commands.\n\nFor example, you can say, “What’s the weather like tomorrow?” to get a\nforecast. Follow up with, “And tomorrow”, and Google knows that you’re after a\nfollow-up weather report.\n\nThe power of Google means that you can ask for directions or traffic reports\nto anywhere, with the results being pulled from Google Maps. In comparison,\nthe Echo can only give you traffic information to one address that you enter\ninto the Alexa app.\n\nThat’s not to say that Google wins everything hands-down, as Alexa can do some\nthings that Google can’t. For example, Alexa can pull information from a G\nSuite Google Calendar (that’s a paid-for account), whereas the Google\nAssistant still can’t.\n\nAnd, when Alexa can’t do something, there’s an app store full of Skills that\nlet you expand capabilities far beyond what Google Home can do. There’s\neverything from tube status updates to bedtime stories in the mix.\n\nBoth devices now support multiple users, using voice recognition so that you\ncan get tailored calendar and route information.\n\n**Related:[Echo 2 vs Echo – what’s the\ndifference?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/amazon-echo-2-vs-echo-price-\nrelease-date-design-specs-3298537)**\n\n## Google Home vs Amazon Echo – Smart home\n\nSmart home control is one of the main reasons to buy one of these voice\nassistants, letting you turn on lights or control your thermostat’s\ntemperature using your voice only.\n\nBoth products support the biggest names in the smart home world, including the\nNest thermostat, Samsung SmartThings and Philips Hue lights. While Google is\nexpanding support for smart home devices, Amazon is the de facto standard and\nis more widely supported. Yet, the gap is closing massively, and it’s getting\nrarer to find a device that Amazon supports and Google doesn’t. For example,\nthe [Dyson 360 Eye](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/dyson-360-eye)\nrobot vacuum cleaner currently doesn’t have a Google Assistant option, but it\ndoes work with Amazon Alexa.\n\nAmazon has had an app revamp. Rather than just listing which smart home\ndevices you have, some can now be controlled from the app, such as turning on\nyour Hue lights and setting their brightness level. Now, you can change bulb\ncolour, too. Thanks to the app update, you can now view devices by room (if\nyou’ve grouped them) and by device type (lights, thermostats, etc). In fact,\nyou can pretty much do everything from the app.\n\n![Amazon Alexa App colour\nchange](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nBut, there are some limitations. For example, you can change the temperature\nof a [Nest Thermostat](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nest-smart-\nthermostat), but you can’t do the same thing for [Honeywell\nEvohome](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/honeywell-evohome) at the\nmoment.\n\nAmazon also has Routines, which lets you control multiple devices with one\nphrase. For example, “Alexa, goodbye” could turn off your lights, stop Sonos\nand switch your heating system to Away mode. A recent update lets you control\nthe temperature of a thermostat, too. Google has Routines, too, launching them\nin the UK more recently. In terms of options, to two systems are just about\nequal now.\n\n**Related:[How to create Amazon Alexa\nroutines](https://www.trustedreviews.com/how-to/how-to-make-alexa-routines-\nsmart-home-automation-made-easy-3426061) and [How to create Google Home\nroutines](https://www.trustedreviews.com/how-to/create-google-home-\nroutines-3607768)**\n\nGoogle is playing catch-up, with the new Home View feature. This gives a\nsimilar level of smart device control as with the Alexa app, letting you\ntoggle lights or control a smart thermostat. Home View is available in both\nthe Google Home app and also via the new Home Hub’s touchscreen display.\n\nMore recently, Amazon has added the option to add Echo devices to smart home\ngroups. For example, you could create a group of products that sit in your\nlounge, including lights and a smart radiator valve. Once done, control\nbecomes much simpler, and you no longer have to name the device that you want\nto turn on, as the Echo understands where it sits. You can just say, for\nexample, “Alexa, turn on lights”, and she understands which lights you want to\nturn on.\n\nGoogle has finally implemented this feature. While you could always place the\nHome in a room, only recently does the smart speaker understand this.\nThankfully, you can now just ask Google to turn on the lights, for example,\nand it understands which ones you’re talking about.\n\nWith both the Google Home and Echo devices. You can still control devices in\nother rooms using the full name of the device (“Alexa, turn on dining room\nlight”), but for general use this update greatly simplifies smart home\ncontrol.\n\nIn terms of overall control, the Amazon Echo is best for most smart homes,\nwith more supported devices and a wider range of control options.\n\n**Buy Now:[Amazon Echo at Tesco.com from\n£89](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7090&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-\ntescocampaign&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tesco.com%2Fdirect%2Famazon-echo-charcoal-\nfabric%2F629-5596.prd%3FskuId%3D629-5596)**\n\n## Google Home vs Amazon Echo – Music and video\n\nThe Google Home and Amazon Echo are small speakers, so they’ll play music. The\nEcho unsurprisingly can stream from Amazon Prime Music, while Google will play\ncontent from Play Music and Google Cast. Both feature Spotify and TuneIn\nradio, but Google also offers Pandora (US only).\n\nBoth devices let you create groups for streaming to multiple devices, which\ngives you multi-room audio, too. The control isn’t quite as simple as with a\ndedicated system, such as Sonos, which lets you add and drop speakers to a\ngroup more easily.\n\nGoogle Home’s advantage is it’s Cast support. With this you can send video to\na [Google Chromecast](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/chromecast)\n(Netflix and YouTube), and control playback for your voice; no more scrabbling\nfor your phone to pause the action when your front door rings. Cast support\nextends to speakers, too, so you can voice control your music to any supported\ndevice, too.\n\n![Chromecast](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAmazon lets you link an Echo to a [Fire\nTV](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/amazon-fire-tv-stick) device,\ngiving you similar video playback options, but it doesn’t have the same\nability to broadcast music.\n\n## Google Home vs Amazon Echo – Calls\n\nGoogle and Amazon both have features built in, so that you can use the devices\nfor communication. With Echo, you can call other devices in your home or even\nto friends over the internet, and with the Echo Show that turns into video\ncalling. There’s also a Drop In feature, where you can listen-in to another\nEcho, which is a handy way of having a chat or calling the kids down for\ndinner. For security, you can block Drop In and calling features on each Echo.\n\nGoogle has a Broadcast feature, which sends a recorded message out to all of\nthe speakers in your home. It’s not quite as convenient or as useful as\nAmazon’s feature.\n\nGoogle now has its hands-free voice calling feature available in the UK. With\nthis, you can make high-quality calls for free to local mobile phones and\nlandlines. This could be a great thing for anyone with a mobile plan that\ndoesn’t come with many voice minutes. And, if you set your caller ID in the\nHome app, calls go out as though you made them on your own mobile phone.\n\nVoice quality is excellent on both the Google Home and Google Home Mini,\neasily beating the best hands-free option on any smartphone. Calls can be made\nto any contact in your address book, or to phone numbers found in local search\nresults, such as a takeaway restaurant. Smartly, Google Home can pull in\ndifferent contacts based on the user it recognises, so each person in your\nhouse can make their own calls to people they know.\n\nAmazon has launched a similar service in the US, although there’s no UK\nrelease date for this feature yet.\n\n## Google Home vs Amazon Echo – Conclusion\n\nBoth are great products, and the choice between them is likely to come down to\nwhat you want to do. Google Home is more natural to converse with and a little\nsmarter out of the box. If you’re largely looking for a personal assistant,\nit’s the best choice. Google’s Cast integration makes it brilliant for anyone\nwith a Chromecast or Cast-enabled speakers, too. And, it now has parity with\nAmazon in terms of smart home support (bar the odd product), app control and\nroutines.\n\nThat said, Echo has a wider range of speakers, including the fancy screen-\nenabled Echo Show. While Alexa is a little trickier to talk to, its huge range\nof Skills means that the Echo can do more than Google Home can. Smart home\ncontrol is still brilliant, but Amazon doesn’t have quite the lead it once did\nand now Google matches Amazon feature-for-feature. If you want the range of\nexpandable skills or like a wider choice of device, Amazon Echo is the system\nto buy; for a smarter personal assistant go with Google.\n\n**Which of these assistants do you want to, er, assist you?
