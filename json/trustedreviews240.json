The first ring is based upon Move Minutes and the other on the award of\nHeart Points. The new metrics are based upon recommendations from the American\nHeart Association (AHA) and the World Health Organisation (WHO), with Google\nsaying it will “abstract away the complication” of tracking your activity.\n\nGoogle says Move Minutes is designed to keep you active throughout the day. In\na [blog post](https://www.blog.google/products/android/introducing-new-google-\nfit/) Google Fit head of product Margaret Hollendoner says credit will be\ngiven “for all of your activity.”\n\n**Related:**[ **Android Pie phones: Will your device get the\nupdate?**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/android-pie-9-phones-3535543)\n\nShe says it’ll motivate users “to make small, healthy changes throughout your\nday, like taking the stairs instead of the elevator, or catching up with a\nfriend over a walk instead of a coffee.”\n\nAs for Heart Points, Hollendoner explains: “Activities that get your heart\npumping harder result in even greater health benefits. Heart Points give you\ncredit for these activities. You’ll score one point for each minute of\nmoderate activity, like picking up the pace while walking your dog, and double\npoints for more intense activities like running or kickboxing.”\n\nGoogle says it is following the AHA and WHO’s recommendation of 30 minutes of\nbrisk walking 5 days a week to reach to reduce the risk of heart disease,\nimprove sleep, and increase overall mental well-being.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nGoogle says Fit will automatically detect walking, running or biking via the\nphone or watch sensors. For other types of exercise, Google will calculate the\nHeart Points and Move Minutes achieved during that workout. It also integrates\nwith other apps like Strava, Runkeeper, Endomondo and MyFitnessPal.\n\n**Naturally the idea is to complete those activity rings before the end of\neach day.
