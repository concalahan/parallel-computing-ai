Rockstar has said it will be\nsharing new details in the coming weeks.\n\n## Red Dead Redemption 2 trailers\n\nRockstar Games released the second trailer for Red Dead Redemption 2, shining\na more detailed light on its utterly gorgeous western adventure.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nThe main character is a man called Arthur Morgan, a troubled cowboy who has\nangered groups across the Wild West intent on pursuing him. It seems this will\nbe the driving force of the plot with Arthur befriending unlikely allies on\nhis quest to escape.\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2 looks utterly fantastic, and during the footage, we\ncatch a glimpse of moving trains, intense gunfights and a cheeky bit of cattle\nrustling, all of which will certainly play a part in the full game.\n\n**You can check out the previous trailer below:**\n\nWhile the trailer doesn’t reveal as much as we might have hoped, it does give\na brief and utterly gorgeous glimpse at the world that awaits us in Red Dead\n2.\n\nThe sequel once again takes place in the Old West, brimming with cowboys,\ncattle and shanty towns filled with chaotic bars and bustling general stores.\nIn terms of narrative the trailer is light beyond a single conclusive quote:\n\n_**“Listen to me. When the time comes, you gotta run and don’t look back. This\nis over.”**_\n\nThe voice of these words is unknown, but in the trailer it is followed by the\nvisual of seven men on horseback, the same gang found in the game’s reveal\nartwork. _  \n_\n\n**Related:[GTA 6 latest\nnews](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/gta-6-release-date-news-gameplay-\nstory-trailers-and-wishlist-2993074)** _  \n_\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Red Dead Redemption 2 gameplay – How does it look?\n\nThe very first trailer for Red Dead 2 was a gorgeous showcase of the open\nworld that failed to provide us with a decent idea of how the game will play.\nRockstar is probably just teasing us, with plenty more of the western\nadventure to be shown over the coming 12 months. Judging by the trailer, the\nacts of horseriding, bandit shooting and desert exploring are back and better\nthan ever, albeit in a familar form.\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2 may offer up a total of seven playable heroes, and John\nMarston could well be one of them. The reveal artwork and debut trailer show\nseven men, who are clearly involved with the core narrative or online\ncomponents. Either way, it’d be fantastic to have so many characters with\ntheir own unique traits and skills at our disposal. We’ll be sure to share\nmore gameplay details here as they come to light.  \n**  \nRelated:[PS4 Pro vs Xbox One X](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/xbox-\nscorpio-vs-ps4-pro)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## **Red Dead Redemption 2 map – This could be the new Old West  \n**\n\nA leak seemed to provide the map for the forthcoming Red Dead 2. The image was\nposted to NeoGAF before very quickly being taken down, but not before being\nscreengrabbed and shared all over the place.\n\nA closer look at the map reveals Great Plains and multiple Caravan camps as\npotential locations we’ll be visiting. There are also several islands located\namong the rivers and large expanses of water; let’s hope the missions centered\non these aren’t as tiresome as when John Marsden had to cross ravines to new\nareas on the map in Redemption.\n\n**Related:[Upcoming Xbox One\nGames](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/upcoming-xbox-one-games)**\n\n![red dead\nmap](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**_What do you hope to see from Red Dead 2?
