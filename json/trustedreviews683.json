They’re both two of the biggest trends in\nconsumer technology of the last couple of years, and now Netgear is bringing\nthem together with the Netgear Orbi Voice.**\n\n[Netgear’s Orbi](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/orbi-wifi) is one of\nthe more accomplished mesh Wi-Fi systems around right now, and works my having\nyou scatter multiple Wi-Fi access points around your home to give you more\ncoverage than a single router and generally deal better with the dozens of\ninternet connect devices that now fill most homes.\n\nThen Amazon’s Alexa is…well I’m sure you know what Alexa is by now. After\ndebuting on the [Amazon Echo](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/amazon-\necho) smart speaker, the voice assistant is slowly but surely making its way\ninto any internet connected device big enough to house a microphone and\nspeaker.\n\n**Related:[Best router 2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nrouter-3444249)**\n\n## A smart speaker with a difference\n\nSo yes, the Orbi Voice might not be too different from the Alexa-equipped\nsmart light switches and smoke alarms we’ve seen in the past but there are a\ncouple of things that set it apart.\n\nThe first is its Harman Kardon-designed speaker system, which should mean its\nsound quality is at least on a par with dedicated smart speakers. You can also\ntweak bass and treble levels using Netgear’s own app.\n\nThe second is the similarities between how you should approach Wi-Fi and\nAlexa. Both benefit from multiple access points, and with both you’ll want to\ntry and flood your house so that either your phone or your voice can access\nthem from anywhere.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nCombine this with Netgear’s proven mesh Wi-Fi tech (with the latest version\noffering speeds of “up to 3Gigabits per second”) and you’ve got a promising\nlittle product.\n\nThere are two options for getting the Netgear Orbi Voice. The first is to add\nthe speaker as a satellite to an existing Orbi system (£279), while\nalternatively Netgear is also selling an AC3000 kit featuring a main router\nand the smart speaker as a satellite (£399).\n\nBoth kits will be launching at some point later this year, and we’ll have a\nfull review as soon as we can try them out for ourselves.\n\n**Are you still using a single router or have you switched to mesh Wi-Fi?
