We pit\nSamsung’s latest against Google’s finest.**\n\nSamsung’s recently launched Galaxy Note 7 is an undeniable beast when it comes\nto specs. The high-end phablet is packed with the latest tech, making it\nalmost worth that eye-watering starting price of around £750.\n\nBut last year we were similarly impressed by Google’s [Nexus\n6P](https://www.trustedreviews.com/nexus-6p-review) phablet, awarding the\ndevice a perfect five stars.\n\nAnd although many months have passed since its release, the Nexus handset\nstill stands up as one of the best Android devices you can buy.\n\nWith that in mind, we thought we’d take a look at how it stacks up against the\nformidable Galaxy Note 7 in this Android phablet face-off.\n\n**WATCH: Galaxy Note 7 Hands-on  \n** (video id =5067727543001)\n\n## Galaxy Note 7 vs Nexus 6P – Design\n\nIf you’ve ever used one of Samsung’s Edge models, the Note 7 will be familiar\nto you. With a dual-curved-edge screen, metal rim and glass back, the device\nlooks like a large version of this year’s equally stellar [Galaxy S7\nEdge](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-s7-edge-review). Though\nit’s worth pointing out that the curves on the Note 7 are less pronounced than\non the Edge. All told, it’s really only the more substantial 5.7-inch screen\nwhich sets the Note apart from the other Galaxy offerings.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThe Note 7 is a masterfully designed handset that manages to remain sleek\ndespite the bulkier dimensions. You might want to be careful with that glass\nback, however, as our Galaxy S7 Edge easily cracked in the top corner after we\nwere silly enough to drop it.\n\n**Related:[Galaxy Note 7 vs iPhone\n7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/samsung-galaxy-note-7-vs-\niphone-7-iphone-7-plus)**\n\n![Note 7](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nConsidering Google’s device came out almost a year ago, it should seem a touch\noutdated, but an all-metal design, heavily chamfered edges and a Gorilla Glass\n4-coated display keep it from looking old-hat. The ‘P’ in the name apparently\nstands for ‘premium’ – a label its Chinese designer and manufacturer, Huawei,\nmanaged to live up to.\n\nWhile the Note 7 comes with the new Gorilla Glass 5, offering a higher level\nof protection, both these handsets are beautifully crafted.\n\nHuawei, for its part, also managed to cleverly hide the 6P’s antenna bands,\nand added a curve to the rear of the phablet, making it a pleasure to hold.\nAlso on the back is a fingerprint scanner, which works very well. Samsung, on\nthe other hand, has stuck its fingerprint reader below the home button.\n\n**Related:[Best smartphone](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-\nsmartphone_round-up)**\n\n![Nexus\n6p](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nStaying with backs of these phones, the Nexus 6P’s glass-covered hump, which\nruns the length of the top of the device, houses the camera, flash and a load\nof sensors. Opinion is split on whether this glass strip adds to, or detracts\nfrom, the design, but we quite like it. The Note 7, on the other hand, keeps\nthings simple, with the camera lens, flash and a Samsung logo adorning its\nrear.\n\nBut what about colours? Well, the Note 7 is available in either Blue Coral or\nBlack Onyx (which roughly translates as light blue or black), while the 6P can\nbe picked up in the more reasonably named Aluminium, Graphite, Frost or Matte\nGold.\n\nSo, which one looks best? We’re going to have to give this one to Samsung. The\nNote 7 continues the sumptuous design choices seen on the [Galaxy\nS7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-s7-review) and S7 Edge, and\ncan’t be faulted when it comes to aesthetics. Huawei by no means dropped the\nball with the 6P, but there’s a clear winner in this department.\n\n## Galaxy Note 7 vs Nexus 6P – Display\n\nBoth Samsung and Google/Huawei opted for a 5.7-inch screen on their respective\ndevices, and the similarities don’t stop there. The 6P and Note 7 both feature\na quad-HD 1,440 x 2,560 resolution, making for a 518ppi density.\n\n**Related:[Galaxy Note 7 vs Galaxy\nS7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-7-vs-galaxy-s7)**\n\n![Note 7](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nYou’re going to get super-sharp images on both handsets, and you won’t be\nnoticing individual pixels. In fact, quad-HD resolutions are somewhat\nunnecessary on screens of this size, but as the Nexus and the Note are both\nhigh-end devices, you’d expect the very best.\n\nSo what are the differences between these two phones’ displays? Well, at first\nglance there doesn’t seem to be any. Both use OLED technology, whereby\nindividual pixels emit their own light, eliminating the need for a backlight\n(used in LED LCD panels), and making for darker blacks and more vibrant\ncolours. OLED tech is also more energy efficient.\n\nBoth phones have a Gorilla Glass coating on their screens, although the Note 7\ncomes with the more robust Gorilla Glass 5, and both are capable of\nreproducing 16 million colours. Viewing angles on the Note 7 and 6P are\nfantastic, and overall these are two of the best phone screens you’re likely\nto see. That’s impressive as far as Google is concerned, as its handset is,\nagain, almost a year older than the Note 7.\n\n**Related:[ iPhone 7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-7-release-\ndate-price-rumours-video-images-features-uk)**\n\n![Nexus\n6P](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe real difference here isn’t immediately apparent, but may be significant.\nSamsung has loaded its device with Mobile HDR tech – a riff on the high-\ndynamic-range feature being introduced into high-end televisions. In short, it\nshould make for increased contrast and brightness, more natural colours, and\nmore detail preservation.\n\nIt appears to be essentially an alternative display setting, rather than\nrelying on specially produced HDR video content like the full-fat HDR tech in\nTVs does, so we’re still on the fence about the impact this feature will have.\nOur full review will have all the details when it arrives.\n\nAs it stands, the two phones are fairly evenly matched when it comes to the\ndisplays, but the Note 7 just has the edge.\n\n**Related:[What is HDR?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/hdr-tv-high-\ndynamic-television-explained)**\n\n## Galaxy Note 7 vs Nexus 6P – Hardware\n\nTwo high-end handsets are obviously going to come with some of the best\nhardware available, and the Note 7 and 6P are certainly no slouches when it\ncomes to the spec sheets.\n\nBut the Note 7 might just clinch this one. Of course, Samsung’s device has the\nbenefit of an extra year’s worth of progress in the smartphone industry, so it\nwill naturally have better hardware, or at least more recent hardware. While\nthe Nexus packs in a Snapdragon 810 chip and 3GB of RAM then, the Note comes\nwith a more recent Snapdragon 820 or Exynos 8890, depending on which region\nyou’re in. There’s also 4GB of RAM in the Note.\n\n**Related:[iPhone 8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-8-release-\ndate-specs-rumours-price-uk)**\n\n![Note 7](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nWhen it comes to storage, the Note 7 has 64GB, with the option to use a\nmicroSD card to expand the memory, while the Nexus 6P comes with either 32, 64\nor 128GB of internal storage. There’s no microSD slot on the latter, so once\nagain the Note comes out on top.\n\nSamsung’s handset packs in a few more features that the Nexus doesn’t have,\ntoo. First is the iris scanner, which lets you unlock the phone just by\nstaring at it. The array of sensors on the front of the device allow for this\nfunctionality, which isn’t anything close to a deal breaker when it comes to\nthe Nexus comparison. In fact, we see it as somewhat of a gimmick that won’t\nbe replacing the fingerprint scanner any time soon.\n\nThe second Note-only feature is slightly more substantial. The Note series is\nknown for being the Samsung range with stylus functionality, and the latest\noffering is no different. Samsung’s S Pen still sits in the bottom of the\nphone, popping out when needed, but it’s been improved this time around. It’s\nnow water resistant, and has 4,096 levels of pressure sensitivity, making it a\nfantastically precise stylus offering.\n\n![samsung galaxy note\n7](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nUnfortunately, the Nexus simply can’t compete in this respect, as it has no\ncomparable stylus capabilities, outside of being able to support generic phone\nstyluses that can be used with any handset.\n\nOnce again, the Nexus is a year older, so it’s at a serious disadvantage here.\nBut it’s worth mentioning that Google’s device matches the Note in terms of\nits USB Type-C port. Unfortunately, it can’t quite do the same in terms of\nwaterproofing, as the Note comes with an IP68 rating, whereas you’d do well to\nkeep the 6P away from water.\n\nTaking into account the superior hardware then, the Note 7 certainly outdoes\nthe Nexus 6P in this department – especially when you consider the extra\nstylus functionality and iris scanner, gimmicky as it may be. In reality,\nthese things are both going to offer top-end performance, and you can expect a\nspeedy experience when using either the Note 7 or Nexus 6P.  \n **  \n[](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-8-release-date-specs-rumours-\nprice-uk)**\n\n## Galaxy Note 7 vs Nexus 6P – Software\n\nSamsung’s device runs on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow, but it should be receiving\nan update to Android 7.0 Nougat within two or three months, if a recent report\nfrom the [Korea\nTimes](http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/tech/2016/08/133_211688.html) is\nto be believed. The Nexus 6P is also running on Android 6.0.1, but should also\nreceive an update this month.\n\n![gold nexus\n6p](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSo, ostensibly, these two phones run the same software. But the big difference\nto be aware of is that, what with the 6P being a Google device, you’ll be\ngetting a clean, untouched version of the Android OS. That means no irritating\nbloatware and no attempts to redesign the interface with a proprietary skin.\nJust smooth Android goodness.\n\nUnfortunately, the same can’t be said of the Note 7. While it runs Android, it\nalso comes with Samsung’s TouchWiz UI. The company has done quite a lot to try\nand make the skin less intrusive, but it’s still unnecessary and means you\nwon’t get the same pure Android experience that you will with the 6P. That\nsaid, Samsung has toned the bright colours down, and the icons are less\nchildlike, so it’s a step up from previous Galaxy devices.\n\nThe Note also comes with Samsung’s Knox security software, which backs up a\nneat new feature called Secure Folder. This acts almost as a separate OS,\nallowing you to place apps in it and get a clean install so you can set up\ncompletely new accounts on whichever programs you need.\n\n![Nexus\n6P](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAll told, then, there’s not much in it when it comes to software, but the\nNexus’s untouched Android offering clinches it for us.\n\n## Galaxy Note 7 vs Nexus 6P – Camera\n\nIf you’ve used the camera on the S7 or S7 Edge, you won’t find anything new on\nthe Note 7. It comes with the same 12-megapixel setup, with an f/1.7 aperture\nfor the rear-facing camera, and a 5MP selfie camera. This is the best\nsmartphone camera available, so you can expect top performance from the Note 7\n– especially in low-light environments, thanks to the enlarged pixels and\nwider aperture.\n\nSuper-fast to open, simple to operate, and with optical image stabilisation,\nthe Note 7’s camera will give you the best experience available.\n\n![note 7 pics\n7](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)_The S7 camera in action – colours are bright and accurate_\n\nAll of which seems like a lot to compete with for the Nexus, especially since\nthe range has historically suffered from poor camera performance. Thankfully,\nthe 6P manages to drastically improve things in this department. It’s not\ngoing to give you Note 7-style performance as, again, this phone is almost a\nyear old now, but it actually manages to get pretty close.\n\nThe rear camera has a 12.3-megapixel sensor and laser autofocus. It doesn’t\ncome with optical image stabilisation, however, which the Note does. But the\n1.55µm pixels are larger than the 1.4µm pixels on Samsung’s device, which\nmeans the Nexus should let in more light than its rival, ostensibly allowing\nfor better low-light shots. However, the f/2.0 aperture isn’t quite as wide as\nthe f/1.7 offering on the Note, so it’s certainly a close call when it comes\nto how well these things perform in low light.\n\n![nexus6p\n45](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)_Similarly stellar performance from the Nexus 6P_\n\nWhat we can say for sure is the Note 7 has the better camera – the best\naround, in fact. But the Nexus isn’t as far behind as you may think, and\nactually takes some pretty stunning shots.\n\n## Galaxy Note 7 vs Nexus 6P – Battery\n\nSo how long will these phablet beasts last you on a typical day? First off,\nthe Note 7 comes with a non-removable Li-Po 3,500mAh battery, while the 6P\npacks a similarly non-removable Li-Po 3,450mAh cell. Not much in it there.\n\nWhat does this mean in practice? Well, when it comes to the 6P, the phone is\neasily going to last you all day and well into the next with general use.\nMarshmallow’s Doze feature helps, of course, but the handset is generally\nquite good when it comes to battery life. In our tests, the phone lost 40% of\nits charge between 7am and 6pm with general use.\n\n![6P](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIt also handles video well, too. The 6P lost 7% of its charge during an hour\nspent streaming _Fargo_ on Netflix, which is very respectable, while half an\nhour’s 3D gaming took the battery from 34% to 27%. It’s pretty much what you’d\nexpect from a thin device with a high-res display.\n\nThe Note 7 didn’t quite manage to match the 6P when it came time for\nstreaming, losing 9% of its charge during an hour. However, we did have the\nVideo Enhancer mode on, and once we turned it off, that figure fell to 8%.\nHalf an hour of 3D gaming caused the phone to lose 10%. We’ll have to wait\nuntil our full review is in to fully measure how the battery performs, but on\nthe whole, these two phones are fairly evenly matched when it comes to\nretaining their charge.\n\nBoth the Note and 6P use USB Type-C for charging, which adds an element of\nfuture-proofing to the two devices. Plus they both support fast charging if\nyou use the included charger and plug. That means you can juice the 6P up in\njust under an hour, or get to 60% charge in about 30 minutes. The Note 7\nsupports Quick Charge 2.0 so, as long as you use the Fast Charging mains\nadapter provided, you’ll also be able to fill the battery up in 75 minutes – a\nbig improvement over the 123 minutes it takes to fully charge using a regular\ncharging method.\n\n![Note 7](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nOne difference worth noting, however, is that the Note 7 supports fast\nwireless charging, so you can drop it on a charging pad and expect a fairly\nspeedy charge time – 98 minutes for a full charge. Regular wireless charging,\nin contrast, takes 300 minutes. You’ll need a specific charger from Samsung or\none of a handful of other companies, though. The Nexus doesn’t have any\nwireless charging capabilities.\n\n## Galaxy Note 7 vs Nexus 6P – Summary\n\nLet’s put this as plainly as possible: the Note 7 is the better phone. But\nit’s also really expensive. The thing will cost you £749 outright, which just\nseems insane when you consider how many phones pack in decent hardware at a\nfraction of the price these days. Unless you absolutely have to get your hands\non the S Pen, we’d recommend at least considering the Nexus 6P.\n\nGoogle’s device costs around £440, and will provide speedy performance, a\ngreat screen, and an untouched version of Android. It’s also got a great\ncamera that manages to give the Note 7, with its top-end camera specs, a run\nfor its money.\n\nWith all that in mind it’s a tough one to call. If you don’t want to break the\nbank, the Nexus is the clear winner. If you have the cash, give the Note 7 a\ngo.\n\n**WATCH: What’s the no.1 smartphone in the world?  \n**\n\n****\n\nLet us know in the comments which device you think clinches it.  \n ****\n\n"}
