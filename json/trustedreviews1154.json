Plus, we’ve picked out a few paid-for alternatives to consider.**\n\nBefore we explore each option in more detail, let’s take a quick look at the\nbest Photoshop alternatives available in 2017: **  \n**\n\n  * GIMP\n  * Pixlr\n  * Paint.NET\n  * Sumo Paint\n  * Adobe Photoshop Express\n  * Photo Pos Pros\n  * Affinity Photo (paid)\n  * Sketch (paid)\n  * Pixelmator (paid) **  \n**\n\n****\n\n## Why consider a free Photoshop alternative?\n\nPhotoshop is excellent, but it also costs money – and in these post-Brexit\ntimes of austerity, we don’t really have either the means or the desire to be\ndoing the whole “exchanging money for services” thing.\n\nSo when you can save a bit of cash, you probably should, and one area where\nthis is certainly possible is image-editing software.\n\nI use tools like Photoshop every day, and based on my experience and and a bit\nof general know-how, these are the best free alternatives to Photoshop, so you\ncan download a fully featured graphics editor without spending a penny.\nMarvelous!\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nAnd for those of you who do have the cash to burn and might want a little bit\nmore functionality, we’ve added a few paid-for options to consider – note that\nwe haven’t reviewed them in full, so while we think they’re worth a look, we\ncan’t whole-heartedly recommend them.\n\n**Related:[MWC 2017](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/mwc-2017-barcelona-\ndate-live-news-highlights-phones-sony-samsung-huawei-nokia-htc-lg-microsoft)**\n\n## 1) GIMP\n\n![Gimp](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \n****\n\nAvailable on: Linux, Windows, Mac **  \n**  \nIt’s open-source, it’s comprehensive and, best of all, it’s entirely free.\nGIMP is the go-to tool for those who shun Photoshop’s monthly Creative Cloud\nmembership, and there are numerous reasons for its popularity.\n\nThe software comes with a full toolset that rivals much of what Photoshop has\nto offer, and while the interface is a little different to that of Adobe’s\nsoftware, there’s a modded version of the program that comes with a Photoshop-\nlike interface to make it easier for those transitioning.\n\nGIMP also offers great compatibility, working with a range of file formats,\nplus there are a load of user-created plugins that provide numerous tools you\notherwise wouldn’t get.\n\n  * [**Download GIMP**](https://www.gimp.org/)\n\n## 2) Pixlr\n\n**![pixlr](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)**\n\nAvailable on: Web; desktop and mobile versions also available ****\n\nLooking for something browser-based? **** Look no further than Pixlr. There\nare more than 600 effects, overlays and borders here, along with all the tools\nyou need for photo editing.\n\nWith a similar interface to Photoshop, plus desktop and mobile versions\navailable, Pixlr is a powerful tool for designers on a budget. **** And the\nfact that it can be accessed directly from your web browser makes it a great\noption for those looking to save hard drive space.  \n **  \n**\n\n  * **[Try Pixlr](https://pixlr.com/editor/)**\n\n**  \nRelated:[Best monitors](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-monitors_round-\nup)**\n\n## 3) Paint.NET\n\n![paintnet](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**  \nAvailable on:** Windows\n\nYou might be tempted to skip over this one if you’re a Windows user looking\nfor a free Photoshop replacement – after all, back at school, MS Paint was\nbetter known for being a distraction in IT lessons than a serious image-\nediting program.\n\nBut don’t be so quick to dismiss Paint.NET. Although the main focus here is\nmaking the software easy to use, there’s a surprisingly comprehensive list of\ntools and features that make this open-source offering a decent alternative to\nPhotoshop.\n\nMost notably, you’ll find layer support here, as well as the ability to add\nadjustments, which should make any Photoshop apostate feel at home.\n\n  * [**Download Paint.net**](http://www.getpaint.net/index.html)\n\n## 4) Sumo Paint\n\n![SumoPaint](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**  \nAvailable on:** Web or iPad app\n\nAnother browser-based option (although there’s also an iPad app), Sumo Paint\nisn’t as powerful a tool as Photoshop, but it does offer some great features.\n\nAll the usual editing tools are present and correct, including support for\nlayers and a layout that will be familiar to those accustomed with the\nPhotoshop UI.\n\nWhile Sumo Paint doesn’t pack all the features you’d get with Adobe’s\nalternative, it’s pretty impressive for a free, browser-based editing package.\n\n  * [**Try SumoPaint**](http://www.sumopaint.com/home/)\n\n## 5) Adobe Photoshop Express\n\n![Photoshop\nExpress](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**  \nAvailable on:** Web; also available as Windows, iOS, and Android app\n\nIt might not be a complete replacement for Photoshop, but the most basic\niteration of Photo Express is a useful alternative when out and about.\n\nExpress can be used via the web, or you can download the app for your handset,\nwhich will allow you to edit photos on the go. You’ll be able to make\nadjustments to all the usual parameters such as brightness and contrast, and\nthere are plenty of one-click adjustments for adding some filters to your\nshots.\n\nDon’t expect to find layer support or any other more complicated features\nhere, though.\n\n  * [**Try Adobe Photoshop Express**](http://www.photoshop.com/tools?wf=editor)\n\n**Related:[Best cameras](https://www.trustedreviews.com/top-ten-cameras_round-\nup)**\n\n## 6) Photo Pos Pro\n\n![Photo Pos\nPro](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**  \nAvailable on:** Windows\n\nPhoto Pos Pro’s main draw is that it has two modes: one for beginners and one\nfor more experienced users.\n\nThe former is more akin to Photoshop Express, offering easy-to-add filters and\nadjustments. The advanced mode adds enough tools to bring the program into\nfull Photoshop territory.\n\nYou’ll get all the filters, layers, masks, curves, scripts, effects and\nbrushes you need – and it’s designed with ease of use in mind.\n\nConsidering it’s free, then, Photo Pos Pro is an impressive offering. Note\nthat a paid-for version is available too, which removes the limit on picture\nsize (currently 1,024 x 2,014 pixels). Unfortunately, there’s no Mac version\nat present.\n\n  * [**Download Photo Pos Pro**](http://www.photopos.com/PPP3_BS/Photo-Pos-Pro-Free-Photo-Editor.aspx)\n\n## Paid Photoshop alternatives\n\nWhile there’s no shortage of free Photoshop substitutes out there, there are a\nnumber of paid-for programs available too. Here are a few of the most popular\nones.\n\n## 7) Affinity Photo\n\n![Affinity](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**  \nAvailable on:** Mac, Windows  \n **Price:** £48.99\n\nThere’s no subscription lark here – you pay your money and you get your\nsoftware, just like you used to in the ’90s.\n\nAffinity is a seriously powerful program that provides professional photo-\nediting capabilities – in fact, some users are convinced it tops Adobe’s\nsoftware.\n\nWith comprehensive RAW editing, wide-ranging file compatibility (including\nwith Photoshop files), and hundreds of the tools you need to get the job done,\nAffinity packs in plenty of features to justify its price tag.\n\nIt also includes high-end filters, advanced adjustment layers and, although\nit’s “optimised for Mac,” you can now also get Affinity on Windows.\n\n  * [**Buy Affinity**](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/photo/?source=UKwebgains&siteid=54264&IsoCode=GB&culture=en&MC=WBGSER01)\n\n## 8) Sketch\n\n![Sketch](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**  \nAvailable on:** Mac  \n **Price:** £98.58\n\nSketch combines elements of Photoshop and Illustrator in an intuitive and\nclean UI, offering a boat load of powerful tools for professionals.\n\nThe Vector shape capabilities mean you can create graphics from scratch with\ninfinite zoom, and you’ll find support for layers and gradients here too. The\nInspector on the right of the screen will provide all the information you need\nwhile you’re working, including dimensions, positioning, opacity, blending\nmodes, and more.\n\nThere’s no doubting this is a powerful program, one that’s convinced numerous\ncreative types to become Sketch adherents. It’s a tad pricey at nearly £100,\nbut the features more than back up the price tag.\n\n  * [**Buy Sketch**](https://www.sketchapp.com/#2)\n\n## 9) Pixelmator  \n\n![Pixelmator](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**  \nAvailable on:** Mac  \n **Price:** £28.99\n\nBuilt to play nice with Apple services such as iPhoto and iCloud, Pixelmator\noffers another comprehensive alternative to Photoshop – at a cheaper price\nthan some of its competitors, too.\n\nUse Pixelmator to retouch images, or take advantage of the full-featured\npainting tools to “paint as you would on a traditional canvas.” There’s even\nTouch Bar support for those who have upgraded to Apple’s latest\n[](https://www.trustedreviews.com/macbook-pro-13-inch-2016-touch-bar-\nreview)[MacBook Pro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/macbook-\npro-13-inch-2016-touch-bar-review) with Touch Bar.\n\nIf the thought of getting to grips with a new software package is causing you\nconcern, then you’ll be pleased to discover that there’s an impressive range\nof [tutorials](http://www.pixelmator.com/tutorials/) available to help make\nthe switch with ease.\n\n  * [**Buy Pixelmator**](http://www.pixelmator.com/mac/)\n\n**Related:[Wacom MobileStudio Pro\nreview](https://www.trustedreviews.com/wacom-mobilestudio-pro-review)**\n\n**WATCH: MWC 2017**\n\n**Do you know of any other awesome Photoshop alternatives?
