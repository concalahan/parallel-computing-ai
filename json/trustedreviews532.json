Back at CES 2018 the company\nannounced that it has already started shipping 10nm chips, but these are far\nfrom the desktop-grade processors that enthusiasts have been eagerly\nanticipating. Instead [according\nto](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/05/intel-makes-its-first-10nm-cannon-\nlake-chips-official/) Ars Technica, the first recipient of the next generation\nof chip is the Lenovo IdeaPad 330 (pictured above), a machine that only\nappears to be available via Chinese retailers at present.\n\n[Intel’s own site](https://ark.intel.com/products/136863/Intel-\nCore-i3-8121U-Processor-4M-Cache-up-to-3_20-GHz?q=8121U) details the chip as\nhaving 2-core/4-thread CPU clocked at 2.2GHz base, with 4MB of level 3 cache.\n\nIn the meantime, the delay to 10nm means that 14nm chip production will need\nto be stretched that little bit further. Intel announced that it might have\ntrouble keeping up with demand in the second half of this year, after it\nalready struggled to meet demand when the chips were first released last year.\n\nThe quantity of bad news had an impact on Intel’s share price, which fell 6%\nin after-hours trading despite the company reporting 15% of year-on-year\ngrowth.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\n**Related:[Best CPUs 2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-cpu-for-\ngaming)**\n\n## Moore’s law creaks to a halt\n\nIntel originally had much more ambitious plans for the first generation of\n10nm CPUs, and had at one point intended to release them way back in 2015.\nHowever, over time the difficulties of shrinking its chips became more and\nmore apparent, eventually forcing Intel to abandon its famous ‘tick-tock’\nmodel to make way for a much more sedate tick-tock-tock approach.\n\nThis means that although it took just two years to jump from 22nm to 14nm,\nwe’ve already been on 14nm for over three years now. Intel promised that we’d\nsee Cannon Lake before the end of the year back at [CES\n2017](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ces-las-vegas-2017-news-highlights-\nrumours-dates-schedule-preview \"CES news\"), but there’s still no widespread\nrelease on the table despite Intel proudly proclaiming that [Moore’s law\nwasn’t dead back in October last\nyear](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/intel-shows-off-10nm-cannon-lake-\ncpu-3294613).\n\nWith chip progress slowing, there’s some speculation that network speeds and\ncloud computing will pick up more of the slack. With 4G internet now being\nwidespread, and [5G](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/intel-shows-off-10nm-\ncannon-lake-cpu-3294613) on the horizon, devices are able to offload more and\nmore intensive computing operations to the cloud rather than processing them\non-device.\n\n**Are you in the market for a CPU upgrade?
