Now, the company has the next iteration, the Dash\nReplenishment Service, which will come integrated into a host of appliances\nfrom the likes of Beko, Candy, Haier, Hoover and illy.**\n\nUsing the Dash Replenishment Service, smart devices sense when they’re running\nlow on supplies and then reorder them from Amazon automatically for you.\n\n**Related:[Amazon Alexa guide](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/amazon-\nalexa-guide-3462356)**\n\n“With Dash Replenishment we’re working to make the process of shopping for\neveryday consumables completely disappear because we’ve all felt the\nfrustration of running out of something we frequently use,” said Eric Saarnio,\nhead of Amazon Devices EU.\n\n“Dash Replenishment allows manufacturers to add even more convenience to\nconnected products, enabling a device to automatically reorder so a customer\nnever has to worry about running out of what they need.”\n\nAccording to Amazon, the system works by using a variety of sensors, including\nvoltage, pressure, volume, capacity and other arrays, using the measurements\nto trigger an order just before supplies run out. For example, a washing\nmachine can order detergent, and a printer can get new ink sent.\n\nThe system requires the product’s owner to link their Amazon account, and\nenable automatic re-ordering. According to the Dash Replenishment Service\ndeveloper pages, manufacturers choose which products can be ordered\nautomatically.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nFor example, a printer manufacturer could select two options for replacement\nblack toner, giving users a choice about which one they want to use. It seems\nhighly unlikely, however, that a manufacturer would choose to offer a third-\nparty compatible cartridge in this instance.\n\nLikewise, dishwasher and washing machine manufacturers may choose preferred\nsuppliers, reducing the choice available. And manufacturers can only list\nproducts that are shipped and sold by Amazon, cutting third-party sellers out\nof the mix.\n\nWe’ve asked Amazon if users can override the default selection choice and pick\ntheir own products, and will update this article when the company responds.\n\nThe list of companies getting behind the new service is impressive. Bosch\nSeries 6 and Series 8, and Siemens iQ500 and iQ700 dishwashers will be some of\nthe first products to have the Dash Replacement service, automatically\nreordering detergent when supplies run low. Kyocera has smart printers\navailable that can order ink and toner when supplies start to run low.\n\n**Related:[Best dishwasher](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\ndishwashers-3434055)**\n\nThe scope of Dash Replenishment is huge, with Toshiba announcing that it will\nproduce TV remotes that can reorder batteries; illy will have coffee machines\nthat can order; Beko, Candy, Hoover and Sharp are developing washing machines\nwith the Dash Replenishment Service in; and Beko, Candy and Hoover are\ndeveloping dishwashers that can re-order tablets and rinse aid.\n\nFor Amazon, automatic orders have to be a good thing, generating more sales\nautomatically. Only time will tell if it proves to be such a hit with\nconsumers.\n\n**Do you want your devices to automatically order from Amazon? Let us know\n@TrustedReviews.**\n\n"}
