Given that device offered a 12-megapixel primary camera spec similar(but not identical) to Samsung’s 2017 flagships, it wouldn’t be a surprise tosee the W2019 come with two 12-megapixel rear sensors, as dual camera setupsare now very much in vogue.An upgraded 8-megapixel front ‘selfie cam’ has also been mooted, but as ever,these specs are purely conjuncture at this stage – we hope to learn more soon.One final thing to note is that last year’s Samsung flip phone wasn’t overlyaffordable. Its price cleared the £1000 mark when converted from yuan, meaningyou could likely bag a [GalaxyS9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9) or [iPhoneXS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xs) for a similar outlay.Plus, the W20118 only appears to have been released in China, so you might notbe able to buy one, even if you wanted to.Still, Samsung’s next premium flip phone could well offer some clues as towhat to expect from its next mainstream releases, so we’re intrigued.Watch this space.**Should Samsung release a premium flip phone in the UK?
