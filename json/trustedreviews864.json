However, no further details could be\nrevealed due to a non-disclosure agreement with the notoriously secretive\nfirm.\n\nApple’s interest in the car sector is common knowledge now, but this may be\nthe clearest indication yet that the company has taken its plans beyond the\nconcept stage.\n\nIt’s known to have taken on many of the auto industry’s most prominent\nfigures, including an R&D chief from Mercedes-Benz and a host of Tesla\nexecutives.\n\nBack in May, Apple executive Jeff Williams called the car “the ultimate mobile\ndevice”. Could Apple’s interpretation of that device be in the public realm\nsooner than anyone thought?\n\n"}
