The CPU is\ntargeted at professionals and academics that regularly do high-end\ncomputational work like AAA cinema rendering, data science and machine\nlearning rendering.\n\nAt the bottom end, the Threadripper 2920X features 12 cores and 24 threads and\nshould be good enough for most regular creative workloads.\n\nAll the new Threadripper CPUs use the same upgraded Zen+ architecture seen on\nAMD’s regular Ryzen 2 CPUs, like the [Ryzen 7\n2700X.](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/amd-ryzen-7-2700x-2)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nZen+ is an upgraded 12nm nanometre (nm) FinFET manufacturing process that’s a\nstep up on the previous gen’s 14nm process. It offers a variety of\nimprovements on last year’s chips. These includes improved power\ninfrastructure for higher clock speeds across the board.\n\nSadly, despite the improvements the i9 still wins out on is clock speed. The\nIntel i9-8950HK’s 2.90 GHz base and 4.80 GHz Max Turbo Frequency clock speeds\nremain higher than the top end Threadripper 2920X, which offers 3.0 GHz and\n4.2 GHz base/boost speeds.\n\n### AMD Threadripper 2 Pre-order\n\n[](https://amzn.to/2AQwFUs)\n\n[](https://amzn.to/2AQwFUs)\n\n###\n\n[AMD Ryzen Threadripper 2990WX 32-Core Processor YD299XAZAFWOF 250W 80 MB\n\n](https://amzn.to/2AQwFUs)\n\nPre-order the 2990WX through Amazon and you'll be given a purchase guarantee\nto ensure that you only pay the lowest possible price available.\n\n[Amazon\n\n](https://amzn.to/2AQwFUs)\n\n|\n\nNow £1,665.99\n\n[View Deal](https://amzn.to/2AQwFUs)\n\nNow £1,665.99\n\n|\n\n[Amazon\n\n](https://amzn.to/2AQwFUs)\n\nHowever, the improved architecture and core count mean the new Threadripper\nCPUs should still be significantly faster running creative workloads, like\nrendering graphics in Blender, than Intel’s top Core i9 CPU.\n\nYou can see a full specs break down of the new Threadripper CPUs in the table\nbelow.\n\n**Related:[Intel Canon Lake](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/intel-cannon-\nlake-specs-performance-release-date-2948967)**\n\n**MODEL** | **CORES / THREADS** | **BOOST / BASE FREQUENCY (GHZ)** | **L3$\n(MB)** | **TDP (WATTS)** | **PCIe® Gen 3.0 LANES**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nAMD Ryzen™ Threadripper™ 2990WX | 32/64 | 4.2/3.0 | 64 | 250W | 64  \nAMD Ryzen™ Threadripper™ 2970WX | 24/48 | 4.2/3.0 | 64 | 250W | 64  \nAMD Ryzen™ Threadripper™ 2950X | 16/32 | 4.4/3.5 | 32 | 180W | 64  \nAMD Ryzen™ Threadripper™ 2920X | 12/24 | 4.3/3.5 | 32 | 180W | 64  \n  \n## Threadripper 2 price\n\nThe new Threadripper CPUs are competitively priced. The top specced 2990WX’s\n$1799 (roughly £1400) RRP puts it well below Intel’s Core i9-7980XE which only\nhas 18 cores and costs $1999 (roughly £1480).\n\nBelow it the Threadripper 2970WX will retail for $1299 (roughly £1000). The\nprosumer/enthusiast-focused Threadripper 2950X will set you back $899 (roughly\n£700) and the lowest end 2920X, $649 (roughly £500).\n\n## Threadripper 2 Motherboards\n\nExisting motherboards are being updated to take advantage of the new WX series\nof Threadripper 2 CPUs.\n\nAsus has come out of the gates saying that you’ll be able to download BIOS\ndrivers for motherboards from the X399 Series today. Asus Motherboards that\nare confirmed to be getting Threadripper 2 updates are:\n\n  * ROG Zenith Extreme\n  * ROG Strix X399-E Gaming\n  * ASUS Prime X399-A\n\nAdditionally, Asus says that cooling kits designed to handle the increased\nthermal output you’ll generate when overclocking Threadripper 2s will be\navailable from September, but we’ve no further details on these yet.\n\nIf you’re going to overclock, you’re going to want to consider other cooling\noptions and maybe a new PSU too, so check out our [guide to\noverclocking](https://www.trustedreviews.com/how-to/overclocking-cpu-guide-\nsoftware-intel-amd-2951169) here and download Ryzen Master from AMD’s site, if\nyou’ve not already done so.\n\n## Threadripper 2 release date\n\nAMD expects the 2990WX to start shipping on August 13, with the cheaper 2950X\nfollowing on 31 August. The 2970WX and 2920X are slated to arrive at an\nunspecified point in October.\n\n_**Excited about AMD’s new powerhouse Threadripper 2 CPUs, or are you going to\nwait and see what Intel has in store for us this year?
