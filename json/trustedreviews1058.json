It should also sport a high-resolution 24-megapixel\nselfie shooter.\n\nThat’s only scratching the surface, though. The handset is tipped to feature\nan AI-powered imaging engine, capable of capturing “100% more light” in\npoorly-lit environments and processing images on a per-scene basis.\n\nHere’s the photo as\n[shared](https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/938234050917134336) on Twitter by\ntop mobile tipster Evan Blass, aka @evleaks.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nOther notable purported internals include a 5.8-inch IPS ultra-tall screen\n(1,440 x 2,960 pixels) a 3GHz Kirin 970 octa-core processor, 6GB of RAM, 64GB\nof expandable internal storage and a 3,200mAh battery.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nBruce Lee, Huawei’s VP of Smartphones, recently said that the firm will\n“probably” launch all future flagships at Mobile World Congress, so there’s a\nchance the P11 will be announced at the event, which will take place in late-\nFebruary.\n\nThat seems even more likely when you consider that Huawei’s already\ncommissioning promotional posters for the handset. If it was planning on\nlaunching it later in the year, it would likely hold back to prevent leaks\n(like this one).\n\n**Related:[Huawei P10](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/huawei-p10)**\n\n**Are you excited about the upcoming Huawei P11?
