Why have so many pixels when you’re notgoing to be using them to their full effect? When in FHD+ mode, 2.3 milliondots are being dealt with by 4.2 million physical pixels, which seems like awaste. Indeed, only serving up FHD+ saves processing power, but doesn’t saveany power from the screen itself.Complexity aside, even when in its standard mode, the screen is stonkinglygood. When it needs to, it can rise to an eye-searingly bright 1200 nits. Forfor the uninitiated, a good laptop screen will get to about 300 nits and atop-end HDR TV will generally get to around 1000 nits. That’s unbelievablybright, although it’s hard to verify because even with automatic brightnessswitched off the screen refuses to go beyond 340 nits under normal conditions.I suspect you’ll only ever get to 1200 nits when watching HDR compatiblecontent from YouTube and Netflix, both of which look fantastic.### Best Galaxy Note 8 Deals[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=6224&clickref=tr-newmobiledeals-note8&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fonehouse.co.uk%2Fshoppingcart.aspx%3Fhaffid%3D880557%26gid%3D0%26colid%3D999)[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=6224&clickref=tr-newmobiledeals-note8&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fonehouse.co.uk%2Fshoppingcart.aspx%3Fhaffid%3D880557%26gid%3D0%26colid%3D999)###[Samsung Galaxy Note 8 – 35GB, £43pm, no upfront on EE](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=6224&clickref=tr-newmobiledeals-note8&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fonehouse.co.uk%2Fshoppingcart.aspx%3Fhaffid%3D880557%26gid%3D0%26colid%3D999)A great deal with a generous 35GB of data and zero upfront cost.

There’s a slight blue tinge if youview the phone off-centre, and the two sloping edges lose some brightness andclarity, which is a bit disappointing, if not surprising.With the screen turned up to its full WQHD+ resolution, text is super sharpand crisp, as are high-resolution photos. But, I’ll be honest, you’d be hard-pressed to spot the difference in everyday use. I suppose this conclusion sortof justifies Samsung’s decision to disable the full resolution by default, butthat doesn’t change the fact that this super-expensive screen is being wastedmost of the time.Because of the odd aspect ratio, you have to explicitly set each app you opento be stretched to the full length of the screen. So far I’ve had no problemswith this. The only other downside is that most online videos are in a 16:9aspect ratio, which means your video will have black bars either side of it,or you can stretch and crop the video so it fills the screen. Some widescreenmovies actually benefit from the latter, but you’ll need to decide on a video-by-video basis.One final function of note is the always-on screen. Because AMOLED pixels areself-lighting (they only consume power when they’re not black, unlikeconventional LCDs that are always on), you have the option of keeping thedisplay on with a black and white clock, battery information and mediabuttons.This is great, until you check out Samsung’s power options and realise thathaving it on can decrease battery life by over an hour a day. What’s more, itdoesn’t seem to turn off even when the phone is in your pocket, wasting evenmore precious energy. It’s a great feature on Samsung’s other phones, but whenbattery capacity is so tight, it’s the first thing you should turn off.[ Next  Software and S Pen ](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-8-software-s-pen)"}
