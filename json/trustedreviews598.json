The companies\nhave come together to create the ReRun app, which records your driving footage\nand then overlays it with real-time performance data.\n\nFirst, you’ll need to dock a GoPro onto the hood of your car using a special\nmount. You’ll then connect your smartphone wirelessly to the GoPro, as well as\nto the new F-Type’s infotainment system.\n\n![jaguar\nrerun](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nOnce that’s done, the ReRun will be able to receive performance data directly\nfrom the car, including your speed, throttle position, gear selection, braking\nforce, g-force, and steering wheel angle.\n\nThis data will be overlaid onto your video recording in real-time, making it\nlook a bit like something out of Gran Turismo.\n\nCheck it out:\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nBut what’s really cool is that the ReRun app can also tell when your driving\nis most interesting. Based on that information, the ReRun app will develop a\nhighlight reel that shows off your best moments from the track. These shorter\nclips are ideal for sharing to social media, which can be done directly\nthrough the app.\n\nSpeaking about the GoPro integration, Adam Silver, Senior Director of\nAccessories at GoPro, said: “The ReRun app combines several unique features\nfrom our Developer Toolkits to help F-Type drivers to create premium quality,\neasy-to-share videos of their driving experiences.”\n\nSilver continued: “Thanks to the close collaboration between Jaguar Land\nRover’s InControl Apps team and our Developer Program team, ReRun offers\noutstanding functionality and is intuitive to use. We’re looking forward to\nthe launch and seeing the first customer videos online.”\n\n![jaguar\nrerun](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nWe tried out the ReRun app during an F-Type track day, and were impressed by\nthe simplicity of the system. Once the GoPro is synced up to the ReRun app,\nyou can start recording directly through the infotainment system in the car.\n\nJaguar’s ReRun app is compatible with all new F-Type models, and works with\niOS devices only for now. However, Jaguar assured us that an Android version\nis in the works. As far as GoPro support goes, you’ll need one of the\nfollowing cameras: GoPro Hero5 Black, Hero 5 Session, Hero4 Black, or Hero4\nSilver.\n\n![jaguar\nrerun](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe new Jaguar F-Type range goes on sale from the first quarter of 2017, and\nfeatures a new “super-fast” Touch Pro infotainment system. There are 28\ndifferent models, including the rear-wheel drive 340PS F-Type and the all-\nwheel drive F-Type SVR, which boasts a top speed of 200mph. Prices for\nJaguar’s F-Type series range from around £50,000 to £110,000 and beyond.\n\n**Related:[Jaguar I-PACE](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/jaguar-s-first-\nelectric-car-hits-london-s-roads-meet-the-i-pace)**\n\n**What do you think of Jaguar’s ReRun technology?
