Now the company is looking to push things to the “next level”**\n\nAt [CES 2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ces-2018-live-news-\nhighlights-3350586), the firm announced the HTC Vive Pro, a premium headset\nwith a greatly improved display resolution and pixel density.\n\n**Find out more: Read our[HTC Vive Pro\nReview](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/htc-vive).**\n\nThe Vive Pro has a 2880 x 1600 dual OLED display, falling short of the\n[rumoured 4K resolution](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/3367142-3367142)\nbut still 78% greater than the 2160 x 1200 original.\n\nThe boost to 615ppi, which is better than the Oculus Rift, represents a 74%\nincrease in overall pixel density. This should help with crisper text and\ngraphics within VR experiences.\n\nAnother improvement over the OG Vive is the integration of a dual front facing\ncamera, dual microphones and headphones with a built-in amplifier. On the\ncurrent model, the headphones were only available as an add on.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nBeyond the fetching blue colour scheme and a slightly tighter design, the Vive\nPro also features a redesigned head strap, making it easier for users to\nresize to suit their unique noggins.\n\nThankfully, HTC says it’ll continue to offer the original HTC Vive headset, at\nleast through 2018. Although the company didn’t make any comments on pricing\nand release date (only to say it would be available soon) the appearance of a\nnew model might open the door to a price cut on the original.\n\n**Related:[Oculus Rift vs HTC\nVive](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/oculus-rift-vs-htc-\nvive-2934282)**\n\nWhile the rival Oculus Rift and PlayStation VR headsets have both been trimmed\nsignificantly at various points over the last six months, the Vive has largely\nremained at its significantly higher RRP.\n\n## Going wireless\n\nElsewhere, HTC also announced a wireless adapter, which will work with both\nthe Vive and Vive Pro.\n\n![HTC Vive Wireless\nAdapter](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe adapter, which will give wearers freedom from their PCs and follows the\nrelease of some third-party solutions, will be available this summer at a\nprice to be confirmed.\n\nIn a [blog post](https://blog.vive.com/us/2018/01/08/htc-vive-raises-bar-\npremium-vr-new-vive-pro-upgrade-wireless-vive-adaptor/) the company wrote:\n“The Vive Wireless Adaptor features Intel’s WiGig technology and offers a\npremium VR wireless experience that operates in the interference-free 60Ghz\nband, which means lower latency and better performance. The Vive Wireless\nAdaptor will ship in Q3 to customers worldwide.”\n\n**Are you hoping the arrival of the Pro will signal a much-needed Vive price\ncut?
