It’s weekly\nchallenge time! The Season 6 Week 2 challenges have player visiting corrupted\nareas, using shadow stones, and dealing damage with different weapons.\nInterestingly, a lot of this week’s challenges can be stacked together for\nthose low on play time. How nice.\n\n## Fortnite Season 6 – Free Battle Pass Challenges\n\n**Visit all the corrupted areas**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIs anyone else loving this season’s easier challenges? So for this one, all\nyou need to do is visit each of the corrupted areas. For those who don’t know,\nthese areas are the purple sections of the map, and each often contains\nbetween one and three chest spawns. They also contain the recently-introduced\nshadow stones, which grants the player a ghostly figure that increases\nmovement speed. Keep that in mind for the next challenge…\n\n**Use a shadow stone in different matches**\n\nThis should be simple enough. Just land in a corrupted zone and use one of the\nshadow stones. If you’re hunting out the corrupted zones for the first\nchallenge this should mean you’ll be able to chase two challenges at once.\n\n**Stage 1: Deal damage with standard Assault Rifles to opponents (HARD)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Google Home Hub YouTube](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n###  Will Google Home Hub ever get Netflix?

Assault\nrifles are fairly common drops, so if you’re looking to get this done as\nquickly as possible, 50v50 is the way to go, as you’ll be able to use your\nteam for backup and spray into large groups of enemies on the opposite team.\n\n**Stage 2: Deal damage with Burst Assault Rifles to opponents (HARD)**\n\nAgain, 50v50 is going to be the best mode for this. You could easily get this\nis any mode, but for the same reasons outlined above, 50v50 is the optimal\ngame mode.\n\nWhen it comes to burst damage, it’s best to keep to mid-to-long range. Sure,\nyou can kill people up close with an auto assault rifle, but if you’re using\nthe burst, chances are you won’t be able to hit the DPS target should you go\nup against someone with a shotgun or SMG.\n\nAnother note: If you can, aim to pick up the FAMAS over the generic burst AR.\nTrust us, the FAMAS is vastly superior.\n\n**Stage 3: Deal damage with silenced Assault Rifles to opponents (HARD)**\n\nAnd this is the part where this challenge gets tough. Silenced ARs aren’t a\ncommon drop, unfortunately. Meaning it’s going to take a few matches to find\none. For the highest chance of finding one, head to everyone’s favourite blue\nhouse in Salty, or to any of the corrupted zones, as these areas all contain a\nstellar amount of chests.\n\nThe upside, however, is when you do find one the silenced AR packs a lot of\nstopping power. So expect to have this one finished in one or two matches\ntops.\n\n**Related:[Best Nintendo Switch\nGames](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/nintendo-switch-games-3435122)**\n\n![fortnite](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Fornite Season 6 – Paid Battle Pass Challenges\n\n**Eliminate an opponent from at least 50m away**\n\nWhile you can do this with an assault rifle, snipers are much more reliable\nwhen it comes to insta-killing someone at range. If you’re not the greatest\nsniper on the planet, just grab a hunting rifle. It may not have the stopping\npower of sniper rifles, but it’s much easier to use, and you don’t lose sight\nof your surroundings when you aim down the sights.\n\n**Deal damage with pistols to opponents**\n\nGo to Salty Springs, grab a pistol (or silenced pistol), head to the blue\nhouse, then let rip on anyone you see. If you hate pistols, play a group game\nmode and down someone, then switch to your pistol to finish them off. It\nshould still count the damage and you won’t need to worry about missing your\nshots as much.\n\n**SMG Eliminations**\n\nThe SMGs are still fairly over-powered, which is great if you’re looking to\nblast through this challenge. If you can grab a P90, anyone within range will\ndrop like a sack of spuds. Failing that, the standard SMG still boasts enough\npower to drop most players at mid-to-close range. Just grab one then spray and\npray.\n\n**Stage 1: Deal damage with hunting rifles to opponents**\n\nIf you’re working on the 50m away challenge, it might be worth stacking the\ntwo together. Don’t worry too much about finding the right vantage point, and\ninstead focus on camping the top of the building or player-built structure.\nWhen you see someone, line up your shot carefully then fire. Just keep in mind\nthe trajectory of hunting rifles works more like an arrow than a bullet. So\naim slightly higher than where you’re aiming for if you’re firing from a\ndistance.\n\nOr, like with the pistol damage challenge, down, switch, profit. Hey, if it\nworks, it works.\n\n**Stage 2: Deal damage with bolt-action rifles to opponents**\n\nOkay. So. If you know how to use a sniper you’ll be fine with this one. Find a\nsniper perch, aim for the head, get the kill. If not, it’s recommended to\nstick to the cheesy tactic: Down a player, switch to the bolt-action, shoot\nthem in the face.\n\n**Stage 3: Deal damage with heavy sniper rifles to opponents**\n\nMuch like the suppressed AR challenge, the hardest part here will be finding\nit. The heavy sniper drops in both purple and gold variants, so don’t expect\nto find one the moment you load in. Land Salty or the corrupted zones for the\nhighest chest chances, and don’t forget you have the option to down an\nopponent then switch to the heavy to fire off some damage.  \nIf you manage to find one, one headshot should drop most players. You can\nexpect this to take somewhere between one or two matches to complete.\n\n**Related:[Assassin’s Creed Odyssey\nReview](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/assassins-creed-odyssey)**\n\nAs always, if you’ve got any burning questions about season 6, be sure to\ncheck out our [Fortnite Season 6\nhub](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/fortnite-season-6-news-update-skins-\nweapons-battle-pass-challenges-3505854).
