Graphics also require 40 per cent less power.\n\nThe A72 is also designed to play nice with ARM’s big.LITTLE technology which\nallows one set of processors to do the heavy lifting while the others handle\nthe device’s more mundane, low-powered tasks.\n\nARM also says the designs will enable even thinner and lighter smartphones\nthan ever before\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\n.\n\nIn terms of who’ll be making these designs a reality, Huawei, MediaTek and\nRockchip have already agreed to build the Cortex-A72 processors, while the\ncompany expects them to sit within hardware sometime next year.\n\nWe can certainly imagine these processors sitting within handsets like the\nSamsung Galaxy S7 or the HTC One M10 (or whatever they end up being called).  \n **  \nRead more:**[ **Samsung Galaxy S6 vs iPhone 6: How will Samsung take on\nApple?**  \n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/samsung-galaxy-s6-vs-iphone-6)  \n“Our new premium mobile experience IP suite with the Cortex-A72 processor\ndelivers a decisive step forward from the compelling user experiences provided\nby this year’s Cortex-A57 based devices,” said ARM’s Pete Hutton, executive\nvice president and president, products groups, in a press release.\n\n“For multiple generations, together with our partners, we have delivered the\nleading-edge of the premium mobile experience. Building on this, in 2016 the\nARM ecosystem will deliver even slimmer, lighter, more immersive mobile\ndevices that serve as your primary and only compute platform.”\n\n"}
