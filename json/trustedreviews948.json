Samsung has kept the\noverall design similar – and that isn’t entirely a bad thing. Even though it’s\nbeen around for a year, the curved front and sandwiched metal rim continues to\nfeel distinctly modern. Many phones have adopted a similar look, but none feel\nas highly engineered and finished to perfection.\n\nThe glass remains a smudge magnet, and I live with the constant fear of\ndropping such a large device – but I’m inclined to forgive these shortcomings\nfor such a well-crafted phone.\n\n**Related:[iPhone 9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-9-release-\ndate-3297160) | [iPhone\n11](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-11-release-date-3461925)**\n\nThe biggest design difference is that the fingerprint sensor now sits below\nthe camera, not next to it. This small change makes a big difference: I no\nlonger end up smearing the camera sensor every time I unlock the phone.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nSticking with a glass back enables wireless charging – a Galaxy staple – while\nother much-loved features such as a [IP68 water-resistance\nrating](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/what-is-ip68-ip-ratings-\nexplained-2947135), headphone jack and expandable storage also remain.\nThankfully, the Note 9 foregoes a notch – that annoying cut-out that features\nin the display of so many 2018 smartphones.\n\n**Related:[Best Android phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nandroid-phones-3438996)**\n\n![Samsung Galaxy Note 9\nback](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIf you’re even considering then the Note 9 then you’ll know it’s a hefty\ndevice. Even with a super-slim bezel running around the 6.4-inch screen this\nis still amongst the biggest phones I have used in a long time – and that does\ncome with some issues in itself. This is a tough, often uncomfortable phone to\nhold mostly due to the rather sharp chamfered rim. The whole phone just needs\nto be a bit smoother and softer.\n\nMy big issue with the design is the Bixby button. Sitting just below the\nvolume key, the dedicated button for the Bixby assistant has been a constant\non the past few Samsung flagships – and it remains a source of frustration\nright up to the point you disable Bixby completely.\n\nI’ve lost track of the number of times I’ve pulled the Note 9 out of a pocket,\nclearly hitting the button by mistake and therefore being taken straight to\nBixby. You can turn it off, but I’d much rather have the button accessible but\nwith a better-thought-out action. In fact, why isn’t Bixby summoned with a\nlong-press of the power key? That would make so much more sense.\n\nSamsung is rarely bold with its colour choices, but with the Note 9 things are\ndifferent. The headline-grabbing colour combo here is a blue handset with a\nsharp-yellow S Pen. I love it – and feel it’s a real step forward for a device\nthat in the past has been known for being businesslike.\n\nOther colours include a lavender purple, a fairly standard black, and a copper\nhue that won’t be available in the US/UK yet.\n\n## **Samsung Galaxy Note 9 – Display**\n\nYou won’t find a better display on any current phone than the one on the\nSamsung Galaxy Note 9. It’s a 2960 x 1440 panel, with sloping ‘Infinity’ edges\nand support for HDR content.\n\nThe displays Samsung produces for its own handsets (alongside those of other\nphones, such as the [iPhone\nX](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-x)) are the best for a number\nof reasons. The Note 9 uses an OLED panel. Compared to LCD, OLEDs use less\npower and only power on the required pixels, therefore displaying perfect\nblacks. This means that when you’re watching content with plenty of dark\nscenes, they’ll actually look black rather than slightly washed out.\n\n**Related:[Best phablets](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nphablet-3500572)**\n\n![Samsung Galaxy Note 9 in\nhand](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSamsung’s panels also have much better colours than competing OLEDs from LG –\nin my opinion, anyway – and that’s certainly the case here. In the default\nmode everything looks vibrant and punchy, without sacrificing too much colour\naccuracy. There might be slightly more punch to reds than you’d see in real\nlife, but I think that’s more pleasing to the eye here.\n\nIn their infancy OLEDs on phones suffered with poor brightness and as a result\nhad difficulty with poor outdoor visibility. That’s not the case here: the\npanel is ridiculously bright and I tended to not even feel the need to push it\npast 45-50%. The brightness will also boost in super-bright environments\nmaking it easy to read.\n\n**Related:[Samsung S9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-\ngalaxy-s9)**\n\nOne minor issue, especially in sunnier situations, is reflections on that\ncurved display. This has been an issue for all Samsung phones with this design\ntrait and it remains here. It doesn’t affect usability too much though, and I\ngot used to it after a few days.\n\n[ Next  \nS Pen, Performance and Software\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-9-s-pen-\nperformance-and-software)\n\n"}
