The Nexus 8, which no doubt would prove popular\nwith consumers as the Nexus line always has, would be a great support for HTC\ntoo.\n\nThe Taiwanese company has really streamlined its product range in recent\nyears, relying on flagships like the [HTC One\nM8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/htc-one-m8_Mobile-Phone_review) and mid-\nrange handsets like the [HTC One mini 2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/htc-\none-mini-2_Mobile-Phone_review).\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThere have been a few rumours teasing the potential specs sheet of the Nexus\n8, which is apparently going under the code name Flounder.\n\nThe latest suggests that the Nexus 8 display will be a 8.9-inch panel with a\n2560 x 1600p QHD resolution, putting it on par with the Nexus 10, but with a\nbetter pixel density.\n\nAs for the processing power, the Nexus 8 is expected to pack a 64-bit Tegra\nCPU. This would line it up with the 64-bit Apple A7 processor found in the\n[iPad Mini 2 Retina](https://www.trustedreviews.com/ipad-\nmini-2-retina_Tablet_review).\n\nGoogle did make a particular point in saying that its new Android L operating\nsystem is compatible with 64-bit processors, so watch this space.\n\n**Read more:[Best tablets 2014](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-\ntablets_round-up)**\n\n"}
