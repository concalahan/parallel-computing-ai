Is it a Battle Royale? Is it like Rust? Is it a co-op campaign?\nCan we all take turns with Fisto this time around? All pertinent questions\nthat over development it seems Bethesda has gone back and forth on themselves.\nApart from on Fisto.\n\nAt its most base level Fallout 76 is a PvE shooter with RPG elements focused\non exploration and base building, this time towing along friends, strangers\nand enemies along for the ride. Many of the fundamental mechanics of Fallout 4\nreturn here, working surprisingly well in an online setting. There’s looting\nand scavenging, seeing players collecting items from containers, corpses and\nother things you might expect to have loot stuffed inside. You use these items\nto break down as material for weapon and armour building or modding, or\nimportantly for settlement construction.\n\nThough the combat is all real-time, V.A.T.S also isn’t neglected, though it is\nsomewhat different as it works in real time as a sort of auto-targeting\nsystem.\n\nIf you want to beef it up, you can use the new Perk card system that Fallout\n76 brings to its level progression. This involves each time you level up\ndropping a point into one of the S.P.E.C.I.A.L attributes, then adding a card\nto your hand to a stat. Though, you are free to level up one stat and add a\ncard from another.\n\nThese cards can be rudimentary like boosting run speed with a pistol by 10%,\nto making it so V.A.T.S can blow off limbs, with lots of fun combinations\npossible.\n\n**Related:[Trusted Reviews – Patch Notes Gaming\nPodcast](https://soundcloud.com/patchnotespodcast)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n![Fallout\n76](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nEach card comes with a cost that relates just how many points you’ve put into\na stat. Level 5 Charisma could have two 2 Cost Charisma cards and one 1 Cost\nCharisma card slotted into it, or five 1 Cost Charisma cards slotted in. The\ngood thing about this new system is that you’re never locked into just one\nbuild. When I felt like mixing it up from a melee build into more of a sneaky\nshooting build, it was as simple as opening the Pip-boy up and slotting in the\nmore rifle orientated and sneak critical cards I had in my possession over the\nones that made me good at whacking people with friends.\n\nStarting at level 4 and every 2 levels after that you are gifted a 5 card\nbooster pack of random cards, some of them rare, on top of the ones you get\nfrom leveling and the cards you can loot from the world. Though in theory, it\nis possible to slot in as many cards as you have levels, the game really\nencourages you to make the most of the crafting system of combining two cards\nof the same type to create a much better but higher cost version of it. It\nfelt fun to scavenge new cards and tweak a build on the fly, the pack of five\nevery two levels felt generous and random enough to make me want to not just\nstick to one style of play as new things were constantly opened up for me.\n\nHow effective specialising down each S.P.E.C.I.A.L path feels a little\ntrickier to manage. Opting for a jack of all trades build, I felt happy with\nhow I was making my way through the world till I saw my teammate in action. At\nlevel 9 after three hours of play, he had stacked all of his stat points into\nStrength, boosting his damage to an incredible degree. Mobs of Ghouls and\nScorched that would take the rest of the party 3-4 hits to take down were\nbeing cleaved down in one by our friend in a party hat and pink dress. He\ncouldn’t open safes or hack terminals that well, but he didn’t particularly\nseem to mind.\n\nThis is where teaming up with up to three other players really comes to the\nfore, as it opens up new options of allowing everyone to min-max complimentary\nstats and builds. In a world with only robotic NPCs and terminals, Charisma\nrather than a dialogue tree perk becomes a way to boost teammates; higher\nlevels of it even allowing you to share perk cards with your allies. Another\nplayer can focus on being the designated lockpicker and terminal hacker, or\njust the one who crafts the best stuff for everyone to use when you use the\nworkshops in your captured settlements.\n\n**Related:[Best PS4\nGames](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/ps4-games-3431751)**\n\n![Fallout\n76](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCapturing a settlement in Fallout 76 opens up the building menu many will be\nfamiliar with from Fallout 4. Whilst in the game you can freely set up a camp\nto freely quick travel to in most places outdoors, with some workshops\nattached to it, the settlements in their fixed positions are where a lot of\naction around the map is going to take place and allow building proper, acting\nas major resource hubs.\n\nOnce a Settlement is captured and a little bit of building time leeway goes by\nto set up defensive turrets and fortifications, an AI mob will likely come to\ntake it back straight away. Once this initial wave is repelled, other mobs may\nsometimes attack or other players may come across an event allowing them to\nattempt to raid and steal it away from you.\n\nIt’s possible to save blueprints of constructions you build in settlement\nzones, so if there’s a nice elaborate fortification you’ve spent a while\nbuilding as a motif you can repeat it elsewhere. Once captured anything you\nbuild in a settlement is tied to you as a player; when you leave a game your\nbase comes with you but will appear there once again whatever server you join\nnext. If two players who have built in the same location are on the same\nserver, then whoever joined first takes precedent in loading in their\nstructures.\n\nHow long structures stay in the world after a player logs off Bethesda were\nunclear about. Or as the game servers rely on seamlessly instancing players in\nand out, depending on their level and a multitude of other factors, what\ncounts as leaving a server was also hazy. Whilst this might sound strange to\npeople expecting to mainly be focused on killing other players, this isn’t a\nharsh kill-and-be-killed survival world like Rust.\n\n**Related:[Upcoming Xbox One\nGames](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/upcoming-xbox-one-\ngames-2018-3531040)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThere’s survivalist elements, as there’s a constantly depleting water and food\nmeter you have to manage (where allowing either to deplete fully means your\nAP, used for running and fighting, take a severe hit), but the approach to PvP\nin Fallout 76 belies the mindset behind this all.\n\nWhen in a team, it isn’t possible to hurt your allies at all. The ability to\nengage other players isn’t unlocked until level 5, something the team has\ndebated about themselves as they didn’t want new players to feel overwhelmed\nby all the new systems they’d be learning. Even when PvP is unlocked, to fight\nanother player relies on you both shooting/hitting one another to consent to\nit. Until then you do minimal damage to one another but once consented to full\ndamage can be done but the initiator will be marked as a murderer for all\nplayers on the map, including their teammates, to hunt down.\n\nFurther disincentivizing just mindlessly wailing on one another, there is no\nreward for fighting another player. Death is barely punished as the loser\ndrops some of their junk, which can’t be picked up by the victor, while the\nvictor is an open bounty for all players to collect on; the caps for which\ncome from their own cap stash. The most telling aspect that Bethesda find\npeople pointlessly shooting each other to be the least interesting action folk\ncan have is the fact it’s possible to either block a player entirely so you\nwon’t appear in each other’s worlds, or to turn on pacifist mode where you\ncan’t even be damaged by other players at all.\n\nThe places Fallout 76 incentivises you to fight other players is in the\nsettlement raiding events, or their future plans for events that involve as\nmany as 12 on 12 team fights. In my 3 hour time in the game, an hour was lost\nto trying to get other players to engage in duels that though fun for the\nbrief time they lasted ultimately felt very empty.\n\nThat’s because this is mostly a game about exploration, preferably with\nfriends. Having no NPCs is a strange thing to adjust to, but some of the most\nmemorable moments for me in recent Fallout games haven’t been those\ninteracting with NPCs. It was through environmental storytelling, sifting\nthrough an area, going by visual storytelling and reading terminals to piece\ntogether what happened.\n\n**Related:[Best Gaming Keyboard](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\ngaming-keyboard-3500376)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIt felt easy to always be stumbling upon some new area or quest in the West\nVirginia wasteland like this, with the main quest line of following the path\nof Vault 76’s Overseer being a nice way to discover the game’s mechanic but\nalso bread trail and peel off into places that looked interesting.\n\nClimbing a watchtower, surveying the area, then barrelling into a town of the\nnew mysterious Scorched enemies to find out a little more about them and their\nstrange hivemind tendencies felt very satisfyingly Fallout, only this time\ngood to bring friends along with me. The downtime between these moments felt a\nlittle too long at times though, feeling like as a group we were just\naimlessly exploring and shooting at times for the sake of exploring and\nshooting rather than it being something we were invested in, trying to find\nthe next new area or quest to hook us after the nice first few hours lead in\nto the game.\n\nIt’ll be interesting to see how Bethesda develop the mid and end-game content\nin Fallout 76. We were shown a little the once a week game event of nuke\nfiring, which seems to require a string of quests and looting to gather five\nkeycards.\n\nOnce prepped for launch, a nuke appears as a giant red circle on the map for\nall players, giving time to evacuate the area. It then destroys and heavily\nirradiates an area for several hours. It’s not really designed to be used\nagainst players, as there’s nothing stopping them running out of the zone, but\nmore to create high-end zones of rare crafting items and more difficult\nenemies.\n\n## First Impressions\n\nFallout 76 surprisingly works, it just feels a little too much like Bethesda\nhave managed to create a multiplayer sandbox and are waiting for the players\nto roleplay and fill in the blanks for one another.\n\nIf they can keep people incentivised in playing in the world with more than\njust getting better at simply killing and surviving in it, then this could be\nthe game that takes many people by surprise as the go-to co-op game.\n\nIt currently stands as a fun role-playing survival experience without the\nharshness of worlds like ARC or Rust, mixed with that lovely Fallout feel.\n\n"}
