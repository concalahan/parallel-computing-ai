Is it finally time to upgrade from the [Note\n4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-note-4-review) and [Note\n5](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-note-5-review)? And what ever\nhappened to the Note 6?\n\nIf you’re thinking about buying a new Galaxy Note handset, you could do far\nworse than picking up the new Galaxy Note 7. But if you’re still rocking a\nGalaxy Note 5 or Note 4 – or maybe you’re just considering them thanks to\ntheir reduced pricing – then it’s worth finding out what exactly is the\ndifference between these three formidable smartphones.\n\nAnd if you’re wondering what happened to the Galaxy Note 6, the truth is that\nSamsung decided to completely skip that handset. It’s rumoured that the\ndecision was made to bring the Note series in line with the Galaxy series\nnumerically, but no one outside Samsung really knows for sure.\n\nThe matter is also complicated slightly by the fact that the Galaxy Note 5\nwasn’t available in the UK at launch. But no matter – they can all be bought\nonline in the UK today. Here’s what you really need to know before making your\nnext Galaxy Note purchase.\n\n**Related:[Galaxy Note 7 hands-on](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-\ngalaxy-note-7-review)**\n\n![samsung galaxy note 4 vs note 5 vs note\n7](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg) (Left to right: Galaxy Note 4, Note 5, Note 7)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n## Samsung Galaxy Note 7 vs 5 vs 4 – Price\n\nThis is probably the most important piece of the puzzle. Samsung’s Galaxy Note\nseries is notoriously expensive, even more so than the flagship Galaxy\nS-series devices. But like all Samsung phones, they drop by a fair margin\nafter launch.\n\nSince its 2014 release, the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 price has fallen\nsignificantly. It’s currently available from Amazon.co.uk in Charcoal Black\nfor just £427.49:\n\n[**Buy Now: Samsung Galaxy Note 4 at Amazon.com from\n$439.99**](http://amzn.to/2cDZrrI)\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Note 5, meanwhile, was launched in 2015, and carries a more\npremium price tag of £499.40 for the Gold version:\n\n[**Buy Now: Samsung Galaxy Note 5 at Amazon.com from\n$505**](http://amzn.to/2bdJtFm)\n\nWe’re still waiting for Galaxy Note 7 pricing details, but pre-launch leaks\nsuggested the price could rise well above £700. With a potential £200-300+\ndifference between the Note 7 and its most recent predecessors, we’d advise\nserious caution when picking up this phone. It could be worth considering the\nsimilarly specced [Samsung Galaxy S7\nEdge](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-s7-edge-review), which is\navailable from Amazon.co.uk for just £539.\n\n[  \n**Buy Now: Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Edge at Amazon.com $899**  \n](http://amzn.to/2biJbfg)\n\n## Samsung Galaxy Note 7 vs 5 vs 4 – Specs\n\n**Screen type:**\n\n  * Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – _5.7-inch Super AMOLED display_\n  * Samsung Galaxy Note 5 – _5.7-inch Super AMOLED display_\n  * Samsung Galaxy Note 7 – **_5.7-inch Super AMOLED display_**\n\nNotice a trend here? Samsung has clearly settled on 5.7 inches as the optimum\nsize for its Note screens, and that’s fine by us. The Note is typically\nmarketed as a power-user handset, so having a large screen makes sense. But,\nfortunately, Samsung has decided not to stray past 6 inches into super-phablet\nterritory.\n\nBut the Note 7 screen has one key change this time around: this is the first\nSamsung phone to be marketed with a Mobile\n[HDR](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/hdr-tv-high-dynamic-television-\nexplained) display, which means the phone should offer vivid contrast, as well\nas supporting HDR content from the likes of Amazon and Netflix.\n\nHDR stands for High Dynamic Range, and refers to the range of brightness and\ndarkness that a screen can display. If a product touts itself as ‘HDR’, it\nmeans the screen meets a specific set of requirements that dictate the\nwhiteness of the whites and the blackness of the blacks, which basically means\nyou can expect better contrast overall and greater detail in the lightest and\ndarkest areas of the screen.\n\n**Related:[Galaxy Note 7 vs iPhone 6S\nPlus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-7-vs-\niphone-6s-plus)**\n\n![samsung galaxy note\n7](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\n**Display resolution:**\n\n  * Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – _1,440 x 2,560 pixels (Quad HD) display resolution (518ppi)_\n  * Samsung Galaxy Note 5 – _1,440 x 2,560 pixels (Quad HD) display resolution (518ppi)_\n  * Samsung Galaxy Note 7 – **_1,440 x 2,560 pixels (Quad HD) display resolution (518ppi)_**\n\nIt was speculated that the Note 7 would finally usher 4K smartphone screens\ninto the mainstream, but Samsung has opted to retain the tried-and-tested QHD\nSuper AMOLED display.\n\n**Chip:**\n\n  * Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – _Exynos 5433 chip (20nm, octa-core, 1.9GHz, Cat.6)_\n  * Samsung Galaxy Note 5 – _Exynos 7420 chip (14nm, octa-core, 2.1GHz, Cat.9)_\n  * Samsung Galaxy Note 7 – **_Exynos 8890 chip (14nm, octa-core, 2.6GHz, Cat.12)_**\n\nThe Galaxy Note 7 used a chip that’s more advanced than both the Note 5’s and\nNote 4’s, and is the same chip used in the [Galaxy\nS7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-s7-review). The big movement\nwas between the Note 4 and Note 5, when Samsung upgraded to a 14nm\nmanufacturing process, which resulted in far greater efficiency and power\noutput.\n\nSince the Note 5, Samsung has made a number of improvements, despite retaining\nthe 14nm architecture. (Expect 10nm in next year’s phones, folks.) For a\nstart, two of the processor cores can hit lofty clock rates of 2.6GHz, and\nthere’s a much more powerful Mali-T880 MP12 GPU on board. It also features a\nCat.12 modem, which means the phone can theoretically handle up to 600Mbps\ndownload speeds and 150Mbps upload speeds – depending on what your network can\noffer, mind.\n\nAll this means that the Galaxy Note 7 packs some serious – and, by some\nmeasures, market-leading – computing heft.\n\n**RAM:**\n\n  * Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – _3GB LPDDR3 RAM_\n  * Samsung Galaxy Note 5 – _4GB LPDDR4 RAM_\n  * Samsung Galaxy Note 7 – **_4GB LPDDR4 RAM_**\n\nDespite rumours of 6GB of LPDDR5 RAM, we haven’t seen a step up in memory this\nyear. We may see that jump taken with next year’s [Samsung Galaxy\nS8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s8-release-date-specs-\nrumours-price-uk), but we’d argue that 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM is plenty sufficient\nfor 2016 smartphonery.\n\n**Storage:**\n\n  * Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – _32GB storage (+ microSD card slot)_\n  * Samsung Galaxy Note 5 – _32GB storage_\n  * Samsung Galaxy Note 7 – **_64GB storage (+ microSD card slot)_**\n\nSamsung has lifted the base storage on the Note 7 to a mega 64GB – that’s\nhuge. Better still, the Galaxy Note 7 brought back the microSD card slot,\nmeaning you can boost the storage even further.\n\nBut perhaps the most exciting improvement is that the Galaxy Note 7 uses\nUniversal Flash Storage 2.0 (UFS 2.0), an ultra-fast next-generation storage\nstandard that’s 2.7x faster at reading files than the eMMC 5.0 you find in\nmost smartphones, and consumes about 50% less energy. Samsung also recently\nannounced a 256GB UFS 2.0 card that would work wonders when paired with the\nGalaxy Note 7.\n\n**Related:[Samsung Galaxy Note 7 UK release date – how to pre-\norder](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-7-release-date-\nprice-revealed-uk-pre-order-buy-best-deals-free-gear-vr)**\n\n![samsung galaxy note\n7](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\n**Primary camera:**\n\n  * Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – _16-megapixel primary camera (OIS, f/1.9)_\n  * Samsung Galaxy Note 5 – _16-megapixel primary camera (OIS, f/1.9)_\n  * Samsung Galaxy Note 7 – _**12-megapixel Dual Pixel primary camera (OIS, f/1.7)**_\n\nWe know what you’re thinking: the megapixels have gone down! Sure, but the\ntype of camera has changed, and definitely for the better. The Galaxy Note 7\nhas repurposed the Galaxy S7’s camera, which has widely been lauded as the\nbest phone camera available right now.\n\nSo what is Dual Pixel? Every single pixel on the image sensor has two\nphotodiodes instead of one. The biggest advantage of this increased pixel\ncount is faster focusing. That’s because when you’re taking a photo with an\niPhone, 5-10% of the pixels are used for focusing, but with the Galaxy Note 7\nevery single pixel is able to contribute.\n\nThe other Galaxy Note 7 upgrade is the aperture, which is now marginally\nlarger than the ones featured on the Note 4 and Note 5, meaning it should be\nbetter at shooting in low light. Huzzah!\n\n**Secondary camera:**\n\n  * Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – _3.7-megapixel secondary camera_\n  * Samsung Galaxy Note 5 – _5-megapixel secondary camera_\n  * Samsung Galaxy Note 7 – _**5-megapixel secondary camera**_\n\nThere’s not much improvement on the selfie camera front, unless you’re\nupgrading from the Note 4 to the Note 7. If this is a deal-breaker for you,\nwe’re sorry. Very sorry.\n\n**Battery:**\n\n  * Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – _3,220mAh battery (Fast-charging)_\n  * Samsung Galaxy Note 5 – _3,000mAh battery (Fast-charging)_\n  * Samsung Galaxy Note 7 – _**3,500mAh battery (Fast-charging)**_\n\nThe Note 7 features a 3,500mAh battery, which is bigger than the one built\ninto both the Note 4 and Note 5. That’s good news, as the phone is basically\nusing the same display, so battery life should see an improvement. Of course,\nthat depends on other factors such as OS optimisation and processor\nefficiency. Fortunately, the chip is better and the OS is newer, so battery\nlife should be stellar.\n\n**Related:[Best Android Smartphones 2016](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-\nandroid-phones-1_round-up)**\n\n![samsung galaxy note\n7](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\n**Charging port:**\n\n  * Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – _Micro USB_\n  * Samsung Galaxy Note 5 – _Micro USB_\n  * Samsung Galaxy Note 7 – **_USB Type C_**\n\nThe Galaxy Note 7 is the first of any Note phone – or any Samsung phone, for\nthat matter – to feature a [USB\nType-C](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/usb-type-c-everything-you-\nneed-to-know) connection. The USB-C port is intended to replace the Micro USB\nport, and features a reversible tip – just like Apple’s Lightning cables.\n\n**Dimensions:**\n\n  * Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – _153.5 x 78.6 x 8.5mm_\n  * Samsung Galaxy Note 5 – _153.2 x 76.1 7.6mm_\n  * Samsung Galaxy Note 7 – **_153.5 x 7.9 x 7.9mm_**\n\nThe Note 7 is far slimmer than the Galaxy Note 7, but it’s still slightly\nthicker than the Note 5. That’s probably down to the battery – it’s 500mAh\nbigger on the Note 7. For anyone who’s ever suffered battery life woes (read:\neveryone), you’ll probably learn to live with the marginally increased chassis\nsize.\n\n**Weight:**\n\n  * Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – _Weight: 176g_\n  * Samsung Galaxy Note 5 – _Weight: 171g  \n_\n\n  * Samsung Galaxy Note 7 – **_Weight: 169g_**\n\nThe Galaxy Note 7 is 7g lighter than the Note 4, and 2g lighter than the Note\n5. That’s hardly noticeable in the hand, but every little helps.\n\n**Water resistant:**\n\n  * Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – _No_\n  * Samsung Galaxy Note 5 – _No_\n  * Samsung Galaxy Note 7 – **_Yes (IP68 certified)_**\n\nThe Galaxy Note 7 is the first of the three phones to be waterproof,\nofficially anyway. There was a suggestion that both the Note 4 and Note 5 were\nwaterproof in all but certification, but the Note 7 is the only one officially\ncertified and marketed as waterproof.\n\n**Related:[What’s new with the Galaxy Gear\nVR?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-unveils-new-gear-vr-2-for-\nnote-7-headset-what-s-new-features-all-you-need-to-know)**\n\n![samsung galaxy note\n7](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\n**Stylus:**\n\n  * Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – _S Pen (2,048 pressure levels)_\n  * Samsung Galaxy Note 5 – _S Pen (2,048 pressure levels)_\n  * Samsung Galaxy Note 7 – **_S Pen (4,096 pressure levels)_**\n\nThe Note 4 stylus made a step up from the 1,024-pressure-level S Pen used in\nthe [Note 3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-note-3-review), and\nthe Note 7 makes yet another leap by doubling pressure sensitivity. The S Pen\nfeatured on the Note 7 is the most sensitive yet, and it’s also completely\nwaterproof.\n\n## Samsung Galaxy Note 7 vs 5 vs 4 – Design\n\nAs we all know, good looks are about as important as impressive specs when it\ncomes to buying a smartphone in 2016. Fortunately, although Samsung has\noffered some questionable designs in the past, its most recent handsets have\neasily kept up with the iPhone on the aesthetics front.\n\n**Galaxy Note 4:** The Note 4 felt huge in 2014 with its 5.7-inch screen. But\nthat was before the days of a 5.5-inch iPhone, and we’re much more used to big\nphones now. The Note 4 was (curiously) thicker, taller, and heavier than the\nNote 3, but not so wide. It featured leather-effect plastic on the rear and an\naluminium trim – certainly not as chic as the newer Notes. This was still\nbefore Samsung decided to make its most meaningful aesthetic changes, so we’re\nnot too sold on the Note 4’s design.\n\n**Galaxy Note 5:** Samsung opted for a significant design overhaul with the\nGalaxy Note 5, borrowing plenty from the similarly revamped Galaxy S6. It\nfeatures glass on the front and back, a cool silver anodised aluminium metal\ntrim, and a rear camera sensor that protrudes even more than it does on the\nNote 4. It also features a curved-edge rear that’s been nicked for future\nSamsung flagships too. Probably the most noticeable difference in the hand is\nthat the Note 5 is not as wide as the Note 4, and that improves its ergonomics\nsignificantly.\n\n**Galaxy Note 7:** Just like the Galaxy S7, the Galaxy Note 7 ships with a\nglass back. That means it looks really nice, but glass is notoriously fragile\n– don’t drop this thing. We’ve had a Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge in the\noffice, both of which have been cracked since launch. Nevertheless, the Note 7\nlooks fantastic, and is arguably the most attractive Note to date.\n\nThis is also the first Galaxy smartphone to only be available with a dual-\ncurved-edge display. That will please fans of the Galaxy S6/S7 Edge, but it\nmight turn off those who think it’s a bit of a pointless gimmick. We’re\nconvinced that, while it might not serve any great function, it certainly\nlooks good.\n\nIf style is your goal, the Note 7 has you covered.\n\n![samsung galaxy note\n7](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\n## TrustedReviews Verdicts\n\nThe **Samsung Galaxy Note 4** scored **9/10** in our review, praised for its\nexceptionally sharp and vibrant screen, brilliant battery life, solid all-\nround camera, and processing performance. Our verdict reads:\n\n_“Even if you don’t care for the stylus, the Note 4 is Samsung’s best big\nphone yet, and continues to stay on top of the phablet category it created.”_\n\nThe **Samsung Galaxy Note 5** scored a slightly lower **8/10** in our review,\nbut was lauded for its sleek glass design, speedy overall performance, great\ncamera, and slim body. Our verdict reads:\n\n_“The Note 5 is one of the best phablets on the market, but it’s lost some of\nits uniqueness.”_\n\nIt’s still early days, so we haven’t given the **Samsung Galaxy Note 7** a\nfull review. In its stead, here’s the early verdict from our Mobiles  &\nTablets Editor Max Parker:\n\n_“In many ways, the Galaxy Note 7 isn’t a huge step beyond what Samsung\nalready offers. There’s been no great leap forward in display resolution,\nprocessor power, RAM, or battery capacity. Even so, this feels like it could\nbe the must-have phone of 2016._\n\n“It’s a gorgeous phablet that instantly catches your eye with its sloping\nsides and minimal bezel. Hold it and it feels fantastic. It might be big, but\nI never felt like I was going to drop it. The screen is stunning too, and it’s\ngoing to be as fast as anything on the market.”\n\n“I said this in my Samsung Galaxy S7 review, but Apple needs to do something\nexceptional with the iPhone 7 if it hopes to compete with Samsung in 2016.”\n\n![samsung galaxy note\n7](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\n## Should you upgrade?\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Note 7 has all the makings of a truly exceptional phone,\nand here’s why. It’s basically a clone of the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, with a\nfew additional features. We gave the Galaxy S7 a 10/10 score, and the Galaxy\nS7 Edge a 9/10 score, and they’re both fantastic, easy-to-recommend handsets.\n\nThe main roadblock when it comes to buying the Galaxy Note 7 is almost certain\nto be price – Note handsets are very expensive. But if you’re already a Note\nuser then you know that, and you’re probably willing to shell out for what\npotentially is the best (but not necessarily best-value) phone of the year.\n\nIf you’re considering buying an alternative to the Note 7, the Note 4 is\npossibly a little old. The Note 5 is a strong contender, and will save you\n£200-300. The Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge are also both cheaper, and not\nsignificantly different in terms of specs.\n\nIf you want what is probably the most powerful phone available right now, and\nmoney is no object, buy the Galaxy Note 7. But if you’re a little more\ndiscerning, there are arguably better deals to be had with other Samsung\nhandsets.\n\n(uswitch type=table brand=Samsung model=Galaxy_Note_7 limit=1)\n\n**Related:[Samsung Galaxy S8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-\ngalaxy-s8-release-date-specs-rumours-price-uk)**\n\n**What do you think of the Galaxy Note 7?
