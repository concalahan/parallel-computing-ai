Qualcomm will be helping to power\nthe advanced telematics, infotainment and digital cluster with integrated\nconnectivity, and rear seat entertainment for future cars that have become\nincreasingly tech-filled.\n\n![Qualcomm\nCES](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThis means, in the case of Jaguar Land Rover vehicles, a combination of 4G,\nBluetooth and Wi-Fi tech for connectivity throughout the vehicle delivered by\na Snapdragon 820Am automotive platform. Inside will also be Qualcomm’s global\nnavigational satellite system (GNSS) so vehicles will be more aware of their\nsurroundings, which could mean big things for future autonomous vehicles.\n\nWhile the fruits of Qualcomm and Jaguar Land Rover’s partnerships might be a\nlittle further out, anyone interested in a 2018 Honda Accord will already see\nthe Snapdragon automotive platform in action. Qualcomm will again be powering\nthe telematics, infotainment and navigation but there’s also a Qualcomm 4G LTE\nmodem working in conjunction with Hondalink for vehicle connectivity.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n![Qualcomm\nCES](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nQualcomm says this is all to support the demand for more personalised driving\nexperiences from both drivers and passengers. The Premium-tier Snapdragon\nautomotive platforms will also support machine learning and Snapdragon Neural\nProcessing Engine.\n\nFurther afield, Qualcomm also announced that BYD, China’s largest electronic\nvehicle manufacturer will also be using the Snapdragon 820Am beginning in\n2019.\n\n![Qualcomm\nCES](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAs with recent years, expect car connectivity to be a big trend at this year’s\nCES so check back for more CES car coverage over the next week.\n\n### Ford C-V2X collaboration\n\nDriving autonomous cars forward is a difficult prospect but Qualcomm’s\npartnership with Ford might well help move things along.\n\nCalled C-V2X, or Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything, the technology is about\nadvanced wireless connectivity technology. The ‘everything’ part is important,\nas this is talking about how the vehicles of tomorrow can communicate from\neverything from other vehicles to infrastructure like traffic lights and\npedestrian crossings.\n\nNakul Duggal, vice president of product management, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc\ndescribed the relationship with Ford as “part of a leading effort in the\nautomotive industry in accelerating the adoption of Cellular-V2X into\nproduction vehicles and providing for enhanced safety, driver assistance and\nsupport for autonomous driving.”\n\nImagine cars being able to tell other vehicles important data like their\nposition, speed and intention, or a car being able to communicate with a\ntraffic light up ahead to know that a red light is imminent so it’s not worth\naccelerating.\n\nIt’s these sorts of implementations that make C-V2X an important prospect for\nautonomous vehicles not only for safety but also traffic efficiency.\n\nAll of this is done without the need for a cellular network or cellular\nnetwork subscription. Qualcomm says its C-V2X tech will be compatible with\nfuture devices, services and infrastructure that connect through 5G.\n\nThe first commercial solution of C-V2X is the Qualcomm 9150 C-V2X chipset,\nwhich should be available in the second half of 2018, which could mean we see\nthem in Ford production vehicles in 2019.\n\nField trials should be happening in Ford vehicles in the first half of 2018,\nwith Ford and Qualcomm collaborating on the first trials in San Diego with\nadditional trials in Detroit.\n\n**Are you looking forward to more connected cars?
