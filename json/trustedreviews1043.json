But it’s not about being in hardware, it’s about building better games.\nIt’s about taking bigger leaps forward with the kinds of games that we can\ndo.”\n\nGabe Newell believes that developers should strive to create something truly\nunique in VR, as opposed to simply re-creating what we already have.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nVirtual reality is yet to deliver a killer app, something made even more\ndifficult by the expensive entry point.\n\n**See also:[Oculus Rift Review](https://www.trustedreviews.com/oculus-rift-\nreview)**\n\nWhen asked about the price of VR, Newell said Valve must first work on a\n“compelling reason for people to spend 20 hours a day in VR.”\n\nIn a nutshell, innovating upon the technology and the experiences within it is\nare a far higher priority than immediately appealing to a mass audience.\n\n**Watch:** **PlayStation VR Review**\n\nWhat kind of games would you like to see in virtual reality?
