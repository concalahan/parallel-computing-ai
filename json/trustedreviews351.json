However, now that it’s here it seems\nmany lower-powered Android handsets are struggling to run the resource-\nintensive game. **\n\nFortnite is distinctly different to many games found in the Android family\nsince it circumvents the Google Play Store and is available exclusively\nthrough the Epic Games website.\n\nIt’s a strange move, which some are speculating is Epic’s way of avoiding\npaying a portion of its revenue to Google (a side-effect of Play Store\npurchases).\n\n**Related:[Fortnite Battle Royale\ntips](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/fortnite-battle-royale-\ntips-3383586)**\n\n## Fortnite for Android Release Date and Beta\n\nEpic Games confirmed on August 9 that Fortnite for Android would initially be\navailable on the Samsung Galaxy family of devices. Samsung Galaxy Note 9 and\nGalaxy Tab 4 owners will also be granted access to an exclusive in-game skin.\n\nAs mentioned above, the game will not be available on the Google Play store,\nwhich is how you get access to 99% of the apps available on Android. Instead\nyou’ll have to register on Epic Games’\n[site](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/mobile/android/sign-up) and\nmanually install the APK that’s emailed to you.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nIf you try and search for the game on the Google Play store, you’ll see a\nmessage telling you that it’s not available.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Fortnite for Android: Supported phones\n\nEpic Games confirmed during its recent Samsung Unpacked Presentation that the\nFortnite Android beta will be available across the family of Samsung Galaxy\ndevices including the [Samsung Galaxy Note\n9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-9-release-\ndate-3304594) and the recently released [Samsung Galaxy Tab\n4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-tab-s4). Owners of\nthe latter two devices will gain access to the ‘Galaxy’ outfit in Battle\nRoyale.\n\nSamsung got a weekend of exclusivity, but that came to a close on the evening\nof Monday 13 August. Now the beta is available to download on a number of\ncompatible, non-Samsung devices.\n\n> Hey Android owners!

This is due to multiple\nbackground applications running–leaving the device without enough memory for\nFortnite. We are investigating and working on a fix!\n\n>\n\n> — Fortnite (@FortniteGame) [August 14,\n2018](https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1029225957377368065?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n**Read more:[Best free mobile\ngames](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-free-mobile-games)**\n\nSure, if you’ve got a gaming-focused device like the Razer Phone − which comes\nwith 8GB of RAM − then you might not have any issues, but devices like this\nare in the minority within the Android market.\n\nThat said, even Samsung’s high-end devices are\n[reportedly](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/08/fortnite-on-android-gets-\noff-to-a-bumpy-samsung-only-start-lags-behind-pubg/) struggling to run this\nvery resource-intensive release.\n\nOf course, with the game still technically in beta, problems like this are to\nbe expected as Epic Games developers iron out the kinks and move towards a\nfull release, whenever that may come.\n\n**Have you had a chance to play Fortnite on Android?
