These turn\nyour living room into the environment, or world, of the app. It’s part of [iOS\n11](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/ios-11), but it’s going to be\nsignificantly upgrading in the upcoming [iOS\n12](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ios-12-release-date-features-3385158).\n\nAnd it’s not just for the [iPhone\n8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-8-release-date-specs-rumours-\nprice-uk-2993101) family.\n\nARKit is a developer tool, it’s not something we iPhone users have to worry\nabout too much. However, a look into what it’s about can tell us a lot about\nwhat the future looks like for augmented reality on the iPhone and iPad.\n\nThe software has been around for a little while now, so Apple is preparing to\nlaunch a new version, ARKit 2.0. We heard much more about the update at this\nyear’s [WWDC 2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/wwdc-2018-dates-rumors-\nnews-3399519), and we’ve updated the page below with the new developments.\n\n**Related:[WWDC 2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/wwdc-2018-dates-\nrumors-news-3399519)**\n\n## How does it work?\n\nARKit uses the iPhone’s cameras to map out an environment. A key part is\nrecognising where the walls and floor are, establishing the basic geometry of\nthe space.\n\nIt’s the Apple alternative to Google Project Tango, but puts fewer demands on\nthe hardware. [Project Tango](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/what-is-\nproject-tango-2941129) requires a special camera array with dual cameras and\nan IR transmitter. This lets it make a rough 3D model of a room on the fly,\nand track motion with almost unnerving accuracy.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nARKit doesn’t require this. Instead, it recognises planes, like your floor.\nThen it uses the phone’s camera and its motion detectors to track movement as\nthe iPhone is moved and tilted.\n\nMotion co-processors like the [iPhone 7\nPlus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-7-plus)’s M10 can\nefficiently track data from the gyroscope, accelerometer and magnetometer.\nThis lets it monitor movement in a 3D space without excessive hardware\ndemands. Google has actually announced something similar too, called ARCore.\nIt’s Project Tango for phones without the flashy camera tech\n\nThe core of ARKit is about letting you drop objects into an environment, and\nmanipulate them using the touchscreen. Other than recognising real-world\nobjects, the main aim is to keep track of objects as the iPhone is moved. As\nsoon as it loses track of this, the illusion is shattered.\n\nOne of the most obvious uses for this is interior design. You could place a\nchair in the corner of the room, and see how it looks as you turn the phone\nfor a different view. It is like a more advanced version of some online\nglasses retailers’ virtual try-on feature.\n\nHowever, Apple has also shown off how the functionality is being used in\neducation, with videos showing children getting more information about a piece\nof art hanging on the wall in front of you, or being taught about the\nenvironment by projecting a landscape on a table.\n\nWe tend to think of far-fetched, futuristic real-world uses when we start\nthinking about AR and VR. But some of the best applications of ARKit are\nactually fairly mundane.\n\n## What’s new in ARKit 2.0?\n\nAt WWDC 2018 Apple announced a host of improvements that are coming to version\n2.0 of ARKit.\n\nThe first of these improvements is USDZ, a new file format developed by Apple\nand Disney’s Pixar for ARKit to make it easier to create and share augmented\nreality content. The new format will be supported natively by Adobe’s Creative\nCloud suite of software to allow for compatibility with common programs like\nPhotoshop.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nUSDZ is the new file format Apple has developed for ARKit\n\nOn stage one demonstration showed an electric guitar being imported from a\nshopping website and then placed in the real world to get an impression of how\nbig it actually is.\n\nApple also announced a new app called ‘Measure’, which will make use of the\nupdated ARKit standard to allow you to measure objects in the real world using\nyour phone’s camera. A demonstration showed this functionality off by allowing\nsomeone to virtually measure the size of a suitcase.\n\nHowever, most exciting was multiplayer augmented reality, which allows\nmultiple people to view the same virtual objects at the same time through\ndifferent devices.\n\nOne augmented reality app from LEGO will let up to four players play with\ntheir characters in the same augmented reality environment, all interacting\nwith the world in different ways.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe app combines virtual objects with real-world LEGO sets\n\n## What apps use ARKit?\n\nIt’s early days for ARKit. However, there are already lots of apps showing off\nwhat it can do (if only as trailer videos). Here are a few of the best demos.\n\n**Pokémon Go** is probably the biggest game that uses ARKit right now. It\nemploys the software to virtually place Pokémon in the real world with far\nmore accuracy than it was able to previously. That said, most people who play\nthe game turn off the AR functionality to make it easier to catch the\nmonsters.\n\n**The Machines** is a multi-player RTS game that lets several people play in\nthe same AR environment. You control a troop of soldiers, in the vein of\nCommand  & Conquer.\n\nIt features advanced elements like audio that gets louder as you get closer to\nthe action, and close to console-grade graphics.\n\n**Skyguide** is a very neat astronomy app that pastes constellations onto the\nsky. We’re not talking made-up ones either. Using the compass and your\nlocation, it can determine the actual star charts for your position.\n\n**ModiFace 3D** lets you see how you’d look with a different hair colour. It\ncomes across a more advanced take on what some Snapchat filters do.\n\nThis is an interesting demo because it’s only really concerned with object\nrecognition and tracking in a real space, not the room mapping so many\nassociate with AR.\n\n**ARZombie** is a classic example of an AR game. It puts you in a zombie home\ninvasion scenario, 3D-modelled undead breaking in and attacking.\n\nYou fend them off, and build virtual defences in doors and windows to keep\nthem out.\n\n**Rainforest Garage** is a delightfully silly AR demo. You see an outline on a\nwall, and a blowtorch on the floor. Pick up the blowtorch and you can use it\nto cut out the outlined part of the wall.\n\nIt disappears, opening up to show a cartoony rainforest, like a low-rent\nNarnia.\n\n**AR Tape Measure** is one of the ARKit apps we can really imagine using. The\nname explains it all.\n\nYou tap and drag out a virtual tape measure, which shows you the distance\nbetween objects. A similar tool is also one of the key uses for Project Tango.\nI’d probably still get the tape measure out for home decoration, but it seems\npretty accurate already.\n\n## How does ARKit measure distance with “one eye”?\n\nSome Apple phones have the dual cameras needed for traditional mapping of\nspaces. The iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X do. However, ARKit works\nwith phones other than these too (see below). So how does it work?\n\nNo magic is required. An iPhone’s motion sensors let it approximate with\nsurprising accuracy how much the device is moved or tilted.\n\nARKit may not be able to judge the layout of a room with a single, perfectly\nstill view of a scene. But it can instantly re-analyse that same scene when\nyour hand movements cause the phone to tilt by, say, two degrees.\n\nThis communication between the motion sensors and the camera more-or-less\ncompletely eradicates the issue of having one camera. I said this wasn’t\nmagic, but it’s pretty close, right?\n\nARKit can use this progressive analysis of a space to build as accurate a\nportrait as Project Tango. In theory.\n\n## What are the limitations?\n\nAs with any form of AR, ARKit is fairly processor intensive. This means it’ll\ndrain the battery quickly, and the phone/iPad may get warm or hot.\n\nARKit is not designed to cope with very fast motion either. Apple goes as far\nto explain to developers ways that they should politely advise users to slow\ndown on the Apple Developer website.\n\n## Can I use it in any room?\n\nHow much space you’ll need depends on the kind of app being used. The hair\nchanger Modiface 3D won’t need any at all.\n\nHowever, if you’re hoping to play a full ARKit game, it’s not going to work\nthat well if your living space consists of a bedroom that only just fits in a\ndouble bed. As the environment mapping relies on identifying planes, like the\nfloor, a cluttered and/or cramped space probably won’t do the trick.\n\n## Which phones support ARKit?\n\nARKit isn’t just for the new iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X. It’s\ndesigned for iPhones and iPad that use the A9, A10 and A11 processors.\n\nThat includes the following devices:\n\n  1. iPhone SE\n  2. iPhone 6S\n  3. iPhone 6S Plus\n  4. iPad (2017)\n  5. iPhone 7\n  6. iPhone 7 Plus\n  7. iPhone 8\n  8. iPhone 8 Plus\n  9. iPhone X\n\n**Related:[iPhone 9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-9-release-\ndate-specs-features-price-rumours-uk-3297160)**\n\n**Have one of these? You just need iOS to try it out, once ARKit apps start\nappearing on the App Store.**\n\n"}
