Apple TV releases\nare rarely updated, but we’ve now had two in as many years because of the\nadvent of 4K Ultra HD and HDR (high dynamic range) TVs.\n\n4K TVs have become the standard. It’s possible to get decent ultra-high-\ndefinition sets for well under £1000 now, and many also support HDR. Both\nthese technologies make a huge difference to the viewing experience. 4K makes\neverything sharper than it was in the HD era, but it’s HDR that’s the truly\nexciting step forward.\n\nIn essence, HDR provides more vibrant colours, extra brightness and greater\ncontrast, rendering the viewing experience gorgeously cinematic. Of course,\nthis is simplifying things somewhat. If you want greater detail, then read our\nexplainer articles linked below.\n\n**Related:[What is\n4K?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/4k-tv-10-reasons-why-you-should-\ncare-2908860) | [What is HDR?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/hdr-tv-\nhigh-dynamic-television-explained-2927035)**\n\n![Apple TV\n4K](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nImpressively, the Apple TV 4K supports not just the entry-level HDR10 HDR\nstandard, but also the more impressive [Dolby\nVision](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/should-you-next-tv-have-dolby-\nvision-2921025) platform. This adds extra scene-by-scene data to improve HDR\nplayback.\n\nThe new Apple TV is faster, smoother and smarter than previous versions, too.\nIt has a rich ecosystem of apps and is easy to use.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nIf you’ve recently bought a high-end smart TV from a top manufacturer you may\nquestion whether the 4K Apple TV is worth it. While Apple’s new box of tricks\nis a harder sell in such circumstances, it still has plenty going for it,\nespecially now that recent firmware improvements have sorted out some initial\nproblems.\n\nBut that’s not to say Apple isn’t up against some tough competition. The\nnon-4K [Now TV Smart Box](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/now-tv-box)\nis a user-friendly alternative, and the new 4K/HDR [Amazon Fire\nTV](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/amazon-fire-tv) is both a good\nperformer and significantly cheaper.\n\n**Related:[Best 4K TVs](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-4k-tvs)**\n\nHere’s a video of the 4K Apple TV launch:\n\n## **Apple TV 4K – Design and specifications**\n\nThe Apple TV is a neat little black box. It’s the same size as the previous\nmodel and even looks almost identical, bar a small circular vent at the\nbottom.\n\nA vent often means a fan, and indeed the Apple TV 4K comes with a unit to keep\nit cool when it’s pushed. Don’t worry, though: no matter what I put the 4K\nApple TV through, it remained whisper-quiet. I didn’t hear the faintest whirr\nor whistle.\n\nIt does mean that you should consider its placement, though, away from carpets\nor dusty areas, to ensure the vents remain clean and clear.\n\nThe need for a fan comes down to the Apple TV 4K’s impressive processing\npower. It’s powered by the company’s A10X Fusion chip, the same one found in\nthe fantastic 10.5-inch [iPad\nPro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/ipad-pro) and latest 12.9-inch\nmodel. These are computing powerhouses in a compact form – as is the Apple TV\n4K.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIt needs that grunt to upscale all content to 4K, and to run apps and games\nsmoothly. Its potent brain also makes it highly responsive, whether it’s\nopening apps or playing games.\n\nElsewhere, this robust box sports an HDMI out and Ethernet in. Of course, you\ndon’t need to connect it to the internet via a cable. The 4K Apple TV supports\ndual-band Wi-Fi, which I found coped well, even when streaming 4K HDR content.\n\nWhether this works for you will depend on the distance the Apple TV 4K sits\nfrom the router, the setup of your network, and even the design of your house.\nI did find the Apple TV to be more reliable than a\n[Chromecast](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/chromecast) at a distance\nof 15 metres from the router.\n\nApple’s little black box comes in 32GB and 64GB storage configurations. Since\nit’s likely that you’ll be streaming most content, I don’t see much point in\npaying the extra £20/$20 for the larger option. Unless you intend to download\ndozens of games at a time, that is.\n\n**Related:[What is\n4K?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/4k-tv-10-reasons-why-you-should-\ncare-2908860) | [What is HDR?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/hdr-tv-\nhigh-dynamic-television-explained-2927035)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Related:[iPhone X](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-x-release-\ndate-specs-features-uk-price-2951157)**\n\n## **Apple TV 4K – Siri remote**\n\nApple has invested a lot of thought into the Apple TV 4K’s remote. This proved\nan excellent accompaniment to the first model and is just as good now. The\nonly slight change from the original is the white band around the Menu button,\nwhich makes it more visible and easier to tell the buttons apart via touch\nalone.\n\nOverall, there isn’t much to it. It’s slim and light, has six buttons, as well\nas a clickable touchpad. It also has an accelerometer and gyroscope to control\nit via twisting and swinging, but these will mainly be used for gaming,\noffering similar functionality to a Nintendo Wii remote. It charges via a\nLightning cable and lasts for around six months on a single charge.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIt’s a doddle to navigate the menus using the remote, and Siri is more useful\nhere than she’s ever been on the iPhone. Press the dedicated Siri button and\nyou can ask her a bevy of questions from: “What’s the weather like tomorrow?”\nto the more contextual “Who is that actress?” when watching a movie. An\noverlay slides up so you can continue watching while satisfying your\ncuriosity.\n\nSiri is also the simplest way to find what you want to watch across streaming\napps, or jump back to watching something you hadn’t finished. Most annoying is\nthe fact that search doesn’t work across all apps, so while you can find\ncontent on Netflix and iTunes easily, iPlayer or Now TV content doesn’t show\nup.\n\nThe use of Siri here is clever, but not unique to Apple. Many smart TVs, the\n[Amazon Fire Stick](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/amazon-fire-stick),\n[Nvidia Shield TV](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nvidia-shield) and\n[Roku Streaming Stick Plus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/roku-\nstreaming-stick-plus) offer similar voice command functions these days.\nHowever, the 4K Apple TV has one of the slickest implementations, not least\nbecause using it doesn’t take you out of the moment.\n\nThe remote can also turn on your TV and adjust its volume via an IR blaster,\nif your TV is compatible.\n\n**Related:[Best TVs](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-tv-3440232)**\n\n![Apple\nTV](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## **Apple TV 4K – Setup**\n\nSetting up the 4K Apple TV couldn’t be easier – if you’re an iPhone user, that\nis. Simply enable Bluetooth and place your iPhone near the little black box\nand off you go. Wi-Fi settings and Apple ID are automatically synced, so you\ncan start firing up apps within a couple of minutes. You can then also use\nyour iPhone as a second remote or keyboard for typing.\n\nEveryone else will have to fiddle with the remote to input usernames and\npasswords using an annoying on-screen keyboard. You can also spell them out\nphonetically using the Siri remote, but I’m not a big fan of spelling my\npasswords out loud, even if it’s in the privacy of my own home.\n\nIn the final stage of setup you’ll be asked whether or not you want to turn on\nHDR, assuming you have an HDR-compatible TV. The Apple TV 4K knows what\nversion of HDR your TV can use and automatically sets the right one.\n\nWhen the Apple TV 4K first came out, if your TV supported 4K and HDR, the\nApple box converted everything to appear in 4K with HDR’s extra colour and\ncontrast artificially applied. That happened even if the content wasn’t\nactually made in 4K or HDR, from the menus to the apps and videos. It also\nconverted all content frame rates to 50 or 60Hz if your TV supported that.\n\nFortunately this seriously flawed approach has now been fixed via a software\nupdate, so your Apple TV 4K can adapt its dynamic range and frame rate output\nto match the original source material.\n\nThe Apple TV 4K does still, however, always upscale non-4K content to 4K for\noutput to your TV. This will be fine for many users, but it would be better if\nthere was an option to turn the upscaling off for people who might prefer the\nupscaling in their TVs or, even, dedicated scaler units.\n\n**Related:[Netflix vs Amazon\nPrime](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/netflix-vs-amazon-prime-instant-\nvideo-2918310)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## **Apple TV 4K – Picture quality**\n\nThe automatic, undefeatable 4K and HDR upscaling originally delivered by the\nApple TV 4K (and still on by default when you get a new unit) was at best a\nmixed blessing.\n\nOn the one hand, HD and non-HDR content looked sharper and had more detail in\nlow light. For example, _The Amazing Spider-Man 2_ via an HD stream on Netflix\nlooked great, even during the most over-the-top action scenes, with Spidey\nflinging himself around.\n\nBetter still, the 4K Apple TV managed to imbue extra contrast into the dark\nscenes of the final set-piece, at least when compared with watching it through\nthe LG TV Netflix app.\n\nBut lower-quality content suffered from distracting over-sharpening around\nmoving bodies when run through Apple’s HDR and 4K upscaling, as well as from\nblocky artefacts and ghosting. Watch the poorly shot first season of _The\nOffice_ (UK) and you’d find the Apple TV 4K made it look worse by doing its\nbest to make it look better.\n\nHence my earlier comment that it might be good if Apple added the option of\nplaying content from the Apple TV 4K in its native resolution, as well as its\nnative dynamic range and refresh rate.\n\n![Apple TV\n4K](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nEven though the Apple TV 4K’s HDR up-conversion works better than many rival\nHDR converters, the results often don’t look quite right – especially with\nbright scenes. Converting standard dynamic range sources to HDR means, too,\nthat you’re no longer seeing the film or TV show as it was designed to look.\nAnd that’s a big deal for most serious AV fans.\n\nThe frame rate conversion initially automatically applied by the original\nApple TV 4K setup works better than you’d expect, too. But again, it clearly\nchanges the way a show or film looks – especially if you are converting a 24p\nfilm into 50 or 60Hz. So again, it’s a blessing that Apple now provides the\nfacility to turn the feature off.\n\nBut take note that the new automatic frame rate and dynamic range adjustments\nonly work if the app you’re using provides frame rate and dynamic range data\nin its metadata. If the app doesn’t provide this information, you’ll have to\nadjust the Apple TV 4K’s video output manually, assuming you even know what\nformat the source content is actually supposed to be appearing in.\n\nWhile there are still a few residual issues surrounding content that isn’t\nnatively available in 4K and HDR, what makes the Apple TV 4K special is both\nthe amount and affordability of its native 4K and HDR content.\n\nApple’s iTunes platform carries by far the biggest collection of 4K HDR (often\nDolby Vision HDR) film titles of any European streaming platform, and all the\n4K HDR titles only cost the same as their HD/SDR counterparts.\n\nWhat’s more, if you already own a movie on your iTunes account, then this\nautomatically gets upgraded to 4K HDR if or when a 4K HDR version is\navailable.\n\nThis is all great news for any film and AV fan looking for a way to give up\nphysical media. Especially as native 4K HDR pictures tend to look pretty\nsumptuous via the Apple TV. So long as you have a broadband connection of at\nleast 20Mbps, anyway.\n\nThe Apple TV 4K recently greatly improved its sound quality, too, by adding\nsupport for [Dolby Atmos](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/dolby-\natmos-2942509). This so-called ‘object-based’ sound system paints sound\neffects into a three-dimensional space around you, and can deliver stunning\nimmersion and clarity compared with other sound formats.\n\nTitles on iTunes that support Atmos sound are still fairly rare, but more are\nbeing added all the time. This underlines the Apple TV 4K’s status as being\nable to deliver more premium quality streaming experiences than any other\nEuropean solution to date.\n\nWhile the Apple TV 4K looks and sounds great, it should be stressed that it is\nstill outperformed by 4K Blu-rays. The discs deliver generally higher and more\nconsistent bit-rates for the video, and also use an uncompressed version of\nDolby Atmos, while all streaming services currently use a compressed one.\n\nBut, of course, 4K Blu-rays require shelf space and currently cost far more\nthan 4K HDR titles on iTunes.\n\n**Related:[Best streaming sites](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nstreaming-sites-netflix-alternatives)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## **Apple TV 4K – tvOS, apps and gaming**\n\nIf you live in the UK and enjoy using the iPlayer app, you’ll find it lagging\nbehind the iPad and smart TV versions. Not only does live TV and standard-\ndefinition programming come with an odd stiltedness, it also doesn’t\nautomatically play the next episode in a series.\n\nWhat’s more, as became painfully apparent during the World Cup, Apple’s BBC\niPlayer app does not support 4K or HDR BBC streams, even though the iPlayer\napps on many TVs now do.\n\nWhen I reviewed the 2015 Apple TV, I was underwhelmed by the tvOS App Store.\nTvOS, the system the two latest Apple TVs use, had only just come to fruition\nand there wasn’t much to choose from.\n\nA lot has changed in two years and now there are thousands of apps, from games\nto cooking apps and interactive storybooks to fitness pals.\n\nFollowing the addition of an Amazon Prime Video app a few months back, the\nApple TV 4K now covers most of the key video streaming services. Now TV,\nNetflix, Amazon, BBC iPlayer, ITV Hub, Sky News, My5, RedBull TV, BT TV,\nYouTube, the TV player, and Disney Life are all there. And they’re bolstered\nmassively by the hugely improved iTunes library.\n\nThe only glaring omissions are All4 and Rakuten – plus, in a perfect world, a\nFreeview Play ‘wrapper’ for the UK catch-up platforms.\n\nMusic fans should note that there’s no built-in Spotify support either. Though\nyou can always use the Spotify app on your iPhone or iPad by the simple\nmirroring system supported by tvOS and iOS.\n\nSo the 4K Apple TV is mostly an app star when it comes to viewing. But it’s\nalso a capable gaming machine, thanks to the considerable graphical power the\nA10X chip packs. It’s just a shame the Siri remote is a casual gaming\ncontroller at best.\n\nMany of the games on the 4K Apple TV are ports of iOS games and that means\nlots of platformers and endless runners. These need precision controls,\nwithout which some frustration and yelling at the TV is inevitable.\n\nFor titles that require less finesse, like adventure games, the remote works\nwell. Lumino City, for example, looks marvellous and plays well with the\nremote thanks to its point-and-click gameplay.\n\nGames look gorgeous on any 4K HDR TV that can make the most of the Apple TV\n4K. Real Racing 3 is a great example that looks stunning on the big screen. It\nwas also the one game where I experienced occasional slowdown during intense\nrace sequences.\n\nIf you want to enjoy games more on the 4K Apple TV, then invest in a Bluetooth\ncontroller. The Apple TV 4K is compatible with most of them, and playing with\none makes a huge difference to action games like Galaxy of Fire: Manticore\nRising and platformers.\n\nOne thing lacking from the first versions of tvOS was parental control.\nHappily there’s now a restrictions setting that lets you manage this on a\ncontent or app level, so you won’t have to worry about little eyes seeing what\nthey shouldn’t.\n\nWhile the 4K Apple TV is about entertainment, it is also the hub for Apple’s\ntake on the smart home, called HomeKit.\n\nThis means you can use the 4K Apple TV to control any HomeKit-compatible\nproducts. You can ask it to turn down your smart lights when you’re about to\nwatch a movie or turn on your security camera at night. The range of\ncompatible products isn’t huge, but it is growing.\n\n![Lumino\nCity](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## **Why buy the Apple TV 4K?**\n\nIf you’ve got a 4K HDR TV and aren’t impressed with its smarts, then the Apple\nTV 4K is now, following some software fixes, a superb upgrade for under £200.\nIt’s slick, easy to use and offers most of the apps a good home entertainment\nsystem needs.\n\nEven if you already have a pretty good Smart TV, the Apple TV 4K is still a\ncompelling proposition thanks to the huge range of 4K HDR/Dolby Vision/Dolby\nAtmos film titles on iTunes. Free upgrades to 4K HDR and cheap prices for new\n4K HDR purchases feel like the future, and have made me consider building an\niTunes movie library for the first time.\n\nThe Siri remote is great for navigating, and the voice commands with cross-app\ncontent search are intuitive. If you care about gaming on your Apple TV 4K,\nthen get a proper third-party controller.\n\nIf you’re not an iPhone user, you may be better off opting for a different\nstreaming box or stick, unless you’re prepared to devote yourself to iTunes.\n\nWhen it comes to rivals, the [Nvidia\nShield](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nvidia-shield) is great if\nyou’re also a gamer. Amazon has just updated its [Fire\nTV](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/amazon-fire-stick), and its £70\nprice will be appealing if you’re on a budget. Then there’s the [Roku\nStreaming Stick Plus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/roku-streaming-\nstick-plus), which leads the market in app support.\n\n## **Verdict**\n\nThe slickest TV streaming box around has got the 4K HDR upgrade it so badly\nneeded – especially now that some initial teething troubles have mostly been\nsolved.\n\nIf your smart TV is a bit thick or you want access to a huge selection of\naffordable 4K HDR movie streams, then the Apple TV 4K is an essential addition\nto your entertainment arsenal – especially if you’re already an Apple user.\n\n## Score\n\n  \n\n"}
