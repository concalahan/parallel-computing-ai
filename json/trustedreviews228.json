You’ve come to the right place – we’ve\ngot all the details on why OLED screens are so much better than the\nalternatives.**\n\nApple’s new [iPhone X](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-x-release-\ndate-specs-features-uk-price-2951157) is now official, and one of the biggest\nimprovements is the introduction of an OLED display. It’s a type of screen\ntechnology that’s been around for a while, but this is the first time it’s\never been used in an iPhone. So what is it?\n\nBelow we’ll explain what an OLED display is, what makes it better than the\nalternatives, and reel off a bunch of the best phones you can buy that already\nuse OLED tech.\n\n**Related:[OLED vs LED LCD](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/oled-vs-\nled-lcd-2924602)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: Max Parker / Trusted Reviews\n\n## What is an OLED display?\n\nThe term OLED is actually an acronym, and stands for _organic light-emitting\ndiode_. For the unaware, a light-emitting diode is basically just a light\nsource, and they’re used widely in electronics.\n\nBut OLED is different because of the _organic_ part. In an organic diode,\nthere’s a thin film of organic compound that emits light when you pass an\nelectric current through it.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n###  Spintires: Mudrunners – American Wilds Edition\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/spintires-mudrunners-american-wilds-\nedition \"Spintires: Mudrunners – American Wilds Edition\")\n\n  * [ ![Galaxy Note 10](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Best Phone 2018: 10 best smartphones revealed and rated\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-smartphone-3431175 \"Best Phone\n2018: 10 best smartphones revealed and rated\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Wooting One Keyboard](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Wooting One\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/wooting-one \"Wooting One\")\n\n  * \n\nSo manufacturers take this organic semiconducting material and place it\nbetween two electrodes, which provide the current. Usually one of these\nelectrodes is transparent, so the light that is being generated can escape –\nand be viewed by you.\n\nThese organic diodes – OLEDs, as it were – are used in bulk to create digital\ndisplays on a wide range of products, right the way from small wearable and\nsmartphones, all the way up to huge, hulking television sets.\n\n**Related:[iPhone 9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-9-release-\ndate-specs-features-price-rumours-uk-3297160)**\n\n## What makes OLED so good?\n\nMany smartphones and televisions use a type of display called LCD, which\nstands for liquid-crystal display. These liquid crystals don’t emit light\ndirectly; instead, you shine a backlight through them to create light. These\ncrystals make up the pixels on your screen, and illuminate courtesy of a huge\nbacklight at the back (or at the edges) of your phone or television.\n\nBut the key advantage of OLED is that the organic diodes emit their own light.\nThis means they don’t need a backlight at all – just an electric current.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Improved battery life\n\nThe first perk this brings is the fact that you don’t need to power a\nbacklight. That’s great, because backlights are very power-hungry, thanks to\nthe fact that they need to always be on to illuminate the display.\n\nBy contrast, an OLED can light up individual pixels when necessary, and to\ndifferent degrees. That’s why battery life can be significantly improved on\nsmartphones that use OLED screens.\n\n**Related:[iPhone 8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-8-release-\ndate-specs-rumours-price-uk-2993101)**\n\n### Thinner phones\n\nAlso, the fact that you’re ditching a backlight also means the entire display\nmodule in your phone can be thinner. That, in turn, means your phone can be\nthinner. Alternatively, phone makers could make a more sensible decision like\nadding a bit of extra capacity with the saved space – but who needs common\nsense, anyway?\n\n### Better contrast\n\nWith LCD screens, it’s not actually possible to show true black. That’s\nbecause there’s a backlight on at all times, which means there’s always some\nsort of light. And because you can’t control lighting in certain areas of a\nscreen, it’s impossible to have detailed control over the brightness of the\ndisplay.\n\nWith OLED screens, the advantage is clear. If an OLED screen needs to display\nblack in an area, your phone can simply turn specific pixels off. This means\nyou’ll have zero light being emitted, which is about as black as it gets.\n\n![LG OLED\nTV](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### More expensive\n\nSo why the hell is anyone still using LCD displays, you’re probably thinking.\nPrice, basically.\n\nTo produce OLED panels was, historically, much more expensive than making LCD\nscreens. The yield was low, and few people could manufacture them effectively.\nThe good news is that the gap has closed significantly, and OLED screens for\nboth televisions and smartphones are quickly dropping in price.\n\nBut for now, you should expect to pay a fair chunk more for your OLED device.\n\n**Related:[Samsung Galaxy S9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-\ngalaxy-s9-release-date-specs-features-price-uk-3266552)**\n\n## Are there any phones with OLED displays already?\n\nThere are phones with OLED screens right now, but they’re few and far between.\nThe problem is that only a few manufacturers are effectively producing them.\nFor instance, LG dominates the TV-sized OLED panel market, which is why LG has\nso many OLED televisions on the market.\n\nFor smartphones, Samsung is the winner. In 2017, it’s expected that Samsung\nwill hold approximately 89% of the AMOLED (active matrix OLED) display panel\nmarket for this year, at least according to analysts at UBI Research. That’s\nexpected to drop to around 72% by 2020, which is good news for consumers and\nbusinesses – at least in terms of pricing.\n\n![samsung galaxy\ns8](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nJust like with LG televisions, Samsung’s dominance of phone-sized OLED panels\nmeant that the Korean firm was able to offer AMOLED screens on its smartphones\nfor years. That’s partly why Samsung has offered OLED for ages, while Apple\nhas stuck with less impressive display alternatives.\n\nHere are a few recent phones that feature OLED screens:\n\n  * iPhone X\n  * [Samsung Galaxy S8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s8)\n  * [Samsung Galaxy S8+](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s8-plus)\n  * [Samsung Galaxy Note 8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-8)\n  * [OnePlus 5](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/oneplus-5)\n  * [LG V30](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/lg-v30)\n  * YotaPhone 3\n  * Meizu Pro 7\n  * Motorola Moto Z2 Force Edition\n  * Vivo X9s\n\nHowever, giving the increasing availability and cheapness of OLED panels, we’d\nexpect this list to grow very quickly, very soon.\n\n**Related:[Best Android phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nandroid-phones-1)**\n\n**Which smartphone that you’ve used had the best screen?
