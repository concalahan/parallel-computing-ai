But\nwith so many sizes and configurations on offer, knowing which is right for you\nis tricky. Here to help, we’ve broken down the key differences between Dell’s\nlatest flagship XPS 13 laptop and XPS 15 2-in-1 convertible.**\n\nOutside of size, the biggest difference between the two devices is the fact\nthat the [XPS 13](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/new-dell-\nxps-13-2018-release-date-price-specs-rose-gold-3365441) is a traditional\nlaptop, albeit a very pretty one, while the XPS 15 2-in-1 is a large laptop-\ntablet hybrid more akin to the [Surface Book\n2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/surface-book-2) or one of Lenovo’s\ntop-end Yoga laptops.\n\nAs a result, both have a very different focus. The XPS 13 is aimed at\ntraditional office workers, prosumers and hardware fanatics looking for a\ncompact but powerful laptop.  \nThe XPS 15 2-in-1 features a touchscreen, a pen, and an innovative maglev\nkeyboard that can be folded behind the screen to turn the whole thing into a\ntablet form. The convertible design makes it far more focused at creatives and\ngamers looking for an all-in-one device that can be used for everything from\ndesign work to AAA 1080p gaming.\n\n**Related:[CES 2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ces-2018-live-news-\nhighlights-3350586)**\n\n## Dell XPS 13 vs XPS 15 – Specs and performance\n\nThe difference in focus is showcased by the two devices’ differing\nspecifications. Both have identical storage and memory options to last year’s\nmodels. Specifically you’ll be able to get the two with either 8GB of 16GB of\nDRAM. Storage options on both start a 128GB of SATA SSD and top out with a 1TB\nPCIe SSD option.\n\nThe key difference between the two stems from their differing CPUs and\ngraphics. The regular XPS 13 is available with either an Intel Core i5-8250U\nrunning at up to 3.4GHz or an Core i7-8550U clocked at up to 4.0GHz. Both use\nIntel’s own integrated graphics. The XPS 15 2-in-1 will run using one of\nIntel’s newer [8th Gen Intel Core processors with discrete AMD Radeon RX Vega\nM graphics](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/intel-lifts-lid-amd-vega-\npowered-chips-promises-smooth-gaming-ultra-thin-laptops-3366729).\n\nSpecifically you’ll be able to pick it up with either a Core i5-8305G\nprocessor with Radeon RX Vega M GL graphics or a Core i7-8705G processor with\nRadeon RX Vega M GL graphics. According to Intel and AMD, whichever version\nyou get the use of Vega should make 15 a cut above the 13 when it comes to\nperformance. Until we know the exact CPU and graphics used in the 15 we can’t\nsensibly say how much more powerful it’ll be. But when Intel unveiled the\nchips at the start of January it made some pretty impressive boasts and showed\nthe RX Vega M GL chip playing AAA titles at 40fps-plus framerates in 1080p.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThe improved graphics architecture is also a key reason the 2-in-1 is so thin,\nmeasuring in at just 16mm thick. That makes it only slightly chunkier than the\ntop-specced XPS 13, which measures in at 11.6mm thin.\n\nThe [new HP Spectre x360](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/new-hp-\nspectre-x360-15-2018-specs-price-release-date-3367792) is the only other\nlaptop confirmed to run using the new AMD Vega-powered chips.\n\n**Related:[Best Intel processor](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/best-\nintel-processor-core-i3-i5-i7-2937692)**\n\n## Dell XPS 13 vs XPS 15 – Screen\n\nBoth feature Dell’s iconic near-bezel-free InfinityEdge display tech and be\navailable with FHD and 4K resoluteness options. The only difference will be\nthat XPS 13 features a smaller 13.3-inch screen and has a non-touch option.\nThe 15 will only have touchscreen options and uses a larger 15.6-inch panel .\n\n**Related:[Best laptops for\nstudents](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-laptops-for-students)**\n\n## Dell XPS 13 vs XPS 15 – Software\n\nBoth versions will be available with Windows 10 Home and Windows 10 Pro\noptions. The 13 is also being offered with Ubuntu 16.04. Dell hasn’t confirmed\nif the XPS 15 2-in-1 will also feature a Linux option.\n\n**Related:[Best laptops](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-laptops)**\n\n## Dell XPS 13 vs XPS 15 – Price and release date\n\nThe new XPS 13 is on sale now, with pricing starting at £1139 on Dell.com.\nDell hasn’t disclosed the price and release date of the XPS 15 2-in-1, and\nuntil we see a full spec sheet we can’t sensibly guess a ballpark figure.\n\n## Which laptop is right for you?\n\nUntil we have more details about the XPS 15 2-in-1 we can’t say how it fully\ncompares to the 13. But given the different size and graphics, the XPS 15\n2-in-1 will likely be a better fit for designers and power users than the\nregular XPS 13.\n\n**Buy the new Dell XPS 13 (2018)[from Dell.com](http://www.dell.com/en-\nuk/work/shop/laptops/xps-13-laptop/spd/xps-13-9370-laptop)**\n\n"}
