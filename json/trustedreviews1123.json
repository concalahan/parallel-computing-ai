Huawei\nalready produces Kirin chips, while LG has launched the [NUCLUN\nchip](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-confirms-own-nuclun-cpu-and-\nfirst-phone-to-be-powered-by-it) with another [mysterious high-end chip in the\nworks](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-tipped-to-battle-snapdragon-\nwith-high-end-mobile-chip).\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThis signals a growing trend in the mobile industry to stave off dependence on\nQualcomm wares.\n\nSamsung is already expected to show off its own Exynos chipset inside the\nsoon-to-be-released [Galaxy S6 and S6\nEdge](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s6-release-date-\nrumours-news-specs-and-price).\n\n**Related:** [12 Best Android Phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-\nandroid-phones-1_round-up)\n\nThe last round of Nexus devices, namely the [Nexus 6\nsmartphone](https://www.trustedreviews.com/nexus-6-review) and the [Nexus 9\ntablet](https://www.trustedreviews.com/nexus-9-review), were ill-received\ncompared to previous Google offerings.\n\nGoogle will likely go to great effort to ensure a better reception for this\nyear’s Nexus line-up.\n\n"}
