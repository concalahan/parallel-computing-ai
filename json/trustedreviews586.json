Here’s everything we know so far, including the\nGalaxy S10’s release date, rumoured specs, and price – plus all the latest\nGalaxy S10 news, leaks and images.**\n\nFollowing the launch of the [Galaxy Note\n9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-9-release-date-\nprice-specs-rumours-features-3304594) this autumn, Samsung’s next flagship\nsmartphone launch will be the Galaxy S10 in 2019 – assuming the near-mythical\n[Galaxy X](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-x-release-date-\nspecs-price-2951423) foldable smartphone doesn’t magically appear in the next\ncouple of months.\n\nAnd while it might seem to be light years away, the S10 rumours are already\nflooding in. Let’s take a look at the absolute latest.\n\n## Galaxy S10 Latest News: Could Samsung kill off the headphone jack?\n\nAccording to the most recent leak, Samsung might be ready to follow in the\nfootsteps of Apple, Google and OnePlus.\n[Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-26/inside-samsung-\ns-bid-to-challenge-apple-with-5g-folding-phones), which cites “people familiar\nwith the matter”, has reported that three versions of the S10 are in\ndevelopment, and that Samsung is “toying with” a prototype that doesn’t have a\nheadphone jack.\n\nThe report also claims that the standard Galaxy S10 will feature a 5.8-inch\nOLED screen that’s curved on both sides, almost no bezel at the top and\nbottom, an in-display fingerprint sensor, triple rear cameras, and a front-\nfacing camera sensor camera that’s visible but “tucked under the screen”.\n\nThat’s rumoured to launch alongside a Galaxy S10 Plus and a cheaper S10 model\nthat features a flat screen and no in-display fingerprint scanner − almost\ncertainly to keep pricing under control.\n\nWe’ve also gotten wind that the Galaxy S10 could be the first handset to ship\nwith the new Universal Flash Storage (UFS) 3.0 standard.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nDuring a presentation at Qualcomm’s 4G/5G Summit in Hong Kong on **Wednesday,\nOctober 24** , Samsung head of mobile product planning, Jay Oh,\n[confirmed](https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-\nufs-30-debuting-2019-lpddr5-2020) that the company’s first wave of UFS 3.0\nproduct will be launched in H1 2019 – which means it’s perfectly primed to\nfeature on the S10, which we expect to see launched at or around the time of\nMWC 2019 in Barcelona.\n\nUSB 3.0 will be compatible with 128GB, 256GB and 512GB phones, as well as\nbeing 5G-ready, so it should slot nicely into Samsung’s flagship lineup as a\nnew feature. This also adds further fuel to speculation the S10 will launch\nwith a 5G chipset, as despite also nodding to 4G technology, next-gen 5G\nconnectivity was very much the headline act of the Qualcomm conference.\n\nPrior to this, a recently published Samsung patent that hints at the Galaxy\nS10 featuring an on-display fingerprint reader. The WIPO\n[filing](https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2018190619&tab=PCTDOCUMENTS&office=&prevFilter=&sortOption=Pub+Date+Desc&queryString=FPsamsung&recNum=21&maxRec=546878),\nwhich you can see below, was first\n[spied](https://www.galaxyclub.nl/nieuws/patentaanvraag-toont-samsungs-\noptische-vingerafdruksensor-voor-de-galaxy-s10/) by Dutch Samsung blog _Galaxy\nClub_ and published on **October 18.**\n\nIf the connection between the patent and the S10 is accurate, it would mean we\ndon’t have to wait until the [Galaxy Note\n10](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/galaxy-note-10-release-date-specs-\nrumours-3606710) (likely to be announced in August or September 2019) for a\nSamsung phone that features an integrated scanner.\n\n![Galaxy\nS10](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nImage Credit: WIPO / Galaxy Club\n\nPrior to this, we heard rumours from another Samsung fan blog, _SamMobile,_\nwhich concerned the Galaxy S10’s camera.\n\nAccording to the **October 2**\n[report](https://www.sammobile.com/2018/10/02/galaxy-s10-camera-specs-\nreport/), the S10 will be kitted out with a triple-camera system that will\nretain the S9’s 12-megapixel f1.5/2.4 lens as its primary sensor. Alongside\nthis, there will apparently be a “super wide-angle” 16-megapixel snapper\n(f/1.9 aperture with a 123-degree field of view), plus a 13-megapixel f/2.4\nlens to complete the picture.\n\nThat’s the good news for Galaxy series fans who love their premium camera\nspecs.\n\nThe bad news? This tri-camera configuration might only be available on the\nhigher-end Galaxy S10+, while the plain ‘ol Galaxy S10 could be pitched as an\n‘affordable’ alternative with a dual-camera setup.\n\nPrior to this, we had some juicy Galaxy S10 gossip\n[via](http://www.thebell.co.kr/free/content/ArticleView.asp?key=201809050100006800000417)\n_The Bell_ on **September 6.** It claims that while the S10 will support\n[5G](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/what-is-5g-vs-4g-2911748), the next-\ngen connectivity won’t be a feature of every model\n([H/T](https://www.sammobile.com/2018/09/06/samsung-galaxy-s10-5g/)). Instead,\nit seems like a 5G Galaxy S10 variant will be made available in select\nmarkets.\n\nSamsung’s home turf of South Korea is the obvious choice here, as the\ncountry’s three largest mobile carriers have all said they’ll launch 5G\nnetworks in March 2019 – right around the time we’re expecting the Galaxy S10\nto launch.\n\nMobile tipster ‘Ice universe’ has also thrown their weight behind the rumour.\n\n> According to sources, the Galaxy S10 adds a 5G version, based on Beyond 2\ndevelopment, adding a 5G baseband.\n\n>\n\n> — Ice universe (@UniverseIce) [September 6,\n2018](https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1037524861416087552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nPrior to this, the same site\n[reported](http://www.thebell.co.kr/free/Content/ArticleView.asp?key=201806210100031290001893)\nthat the S10 won’t feature an iris-scanner. Instead, it’s said to feature a\nface-recognising 3D-sensing camera (a la Face ID on the iPhone X) and an in-\ndisplay fingerprint sensor.\n\nRumours about that in-display fingerprint sensor have been swirling around for\nsome time now, and Samsung is believed to have struggled to get it right.\nHowever, the firm might finally have cracked the formula and be preparing to\nequip its top S10 models with ultrasonic scanners, while trickling down a\ncheaper optical scanner to a more affordable model.\n\nThe report also backs up earlier rumours that the S10 will have a 5.8-inch\nscreen, with the larger S10 Plus measuring 6.3-inches. We’ve also heard\nmurmurs out of South Korea that one S10 model might come with a dual front\n‘selfie cam’,\n\n## Galaxy S10 Rumours: S10 spied in photo leak?\n\nWe may now have our first look at the Galaxy S10 – or at least an alleged\nprototype − too.\n\nMobile leaker ‘Ice universe’\n[tweeted](https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1009341170571341824) the\nimage you see above on June 20, and while it doesn’t explicitly reference the\nGalaxy S10, ‘beyond’ is believed to refer to the codename Samsung is\ndeveloping the phone under.\n\nYou can also potentially see a physical Bixby button on the side of the phone,\nwhich aligns with previous rumours about the S10. Here’s the tipster’s social\nmedia share in full:\n\n> This may be a design beyond.\n[pic.twitter.com/lViQUsW1Jv](https://t.co/lViQUsW1Jv)\n\n>\n\n> — Ice universe (@UniverseIce) [June 20,\n2018](https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1009341170571341824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nPrior to this, we had some not so great news out of South Korea.\n\nThose of you thinking that the Note 9 might be Samsung’s first flagship to\nfeature an in-demand fingerprint scanner might want to look away now, because\na new\n[report](http://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2018/05/11/2018051102214.html)\nfrom South Korea’s _Chosun Economy_ has it all going down differently,\nclaiming that we’ll see this particular killer feature for the first time when\nthe S10 and S10 Plus come out − and no earlier.\n\nBetter tidings came to us from South Korean publication _The Bell_ , however,\nwhich\n[says](https://www.thebell.co.kr/free/content/ArticleView.asp?key=201805030100004070000249&lcode=00)\nthat Samsung is instructing its partners to have components ready to hit the\nproduction line in November. Building on this, it says that the Galaxy S10\nwill be launched in early-2019 – as apparently will the near-mythical foldable\n[Galaxy X](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-x-foldable-\nphone-release-date-news-specs-price-2951423) phone.\n\n[](https://amzn.to/2lnR4Wo)\n\n[](https://amzn.to/2lnR4Wo)\n\n###\n\n[Samsung Galaxy S8+ 64GB - Midnight Black - Unlocked\n\n](https://amzn.to/2lnR4Wo)\n\n£534.99\n\n[Amazon\n\n](https://amzn.to/2lnR4Wo)\n\n[View Deal](https://amzn.to/2lnR4Wo)\n\n[Amazon\n\n](https://amzn.to/2lnR4Wo)\n\n**Related:[Best Galaxy S9 deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/samsung-\ngalaxy-s9-deals-3402357)**\n\nHowever, the release dates will apparently differ for the two devices, with\nthe Galaxy X pegged to headline CES 2019 in January and the S10 – allegedly\ncodenamed ‘Beyond’ – launching at Mobile World Congress 2019 in February.\n\nIf you think that sounds a bit odd, you wouldn’t be wrong. Samsung has a\nstrong presence at CES, but in recent history has used the event to showcase\nits latest TVs and home appliances – a major phone reveal hasn’t happened at\nthe show for years.\n\nMWC makes a lot more sense as it’s a dedicated mobile event, but the thinking\nis that Samsung might not want to launch the two phones simultaneously. We’re\nultimately not much wiser thanks to the report, but as before, Q1 2019 is a\ngood bet for the Galaxy S10 to launch.\n\n**Related:[Best SIM-only deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/sim-only-\ndeals-uk-2943877)**\n\n## Samsung Galaxy S10 News: Galaxy S10 and S10 Plus sizes outed?\n\nPrior to this, the same outlet\n[proffered](http://www.thebell.co.kr/free/Content/ArticleView.asp?key=201804160100029940001840)\nthat the Galaxy S10 rather than the Note 9 will be Samsung’s first phone to\nfeature an in-display fingerprint scanner – something its May report\nreiterates. It also says that the device will feature a 3D camera module\nproduced in partnership with Qualcomm, meaning it could offer the same kind of\nfacial recognition technology as the [iPhone\nX](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-x).\n\nAccording to _The Bell_ , the Galaxy S10 will measure in at 5.8 inches, while\nbig sibling the Galaxy S10 Plus will get a 6.3-inch display, so the duo will\nbe roughly the same size as the S9 and [S9\nPlus.](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9-plus)\n\nThis also means that the S10 likely won’t be the foldable Galaxy X smartphone\nthat has fascinated gossip mongers over the last couple of years. Instead, we\nreckon there’s a good chance Samsung launches the Galaxy X as special 10th\nanniversary handset alongside the S10 and S10 Plus – just like Apple did last\nyear with the [iPhone 8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-8),\n[iPhone 8 Plus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-8-plus) and\niPhone X.\n\nRead on for more Galaxy S10 details.\n\n**Related:[Best Android phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nandroid-phones-3438996)**\n\n## Galaxy S10 Specs: All the latest Galaxy S10 rumours\n\nThis all roughly chimes with what we’ve heard about the Galaxy S10 so far.\n\nPrior to the recent report out of South Korea, the bulk of S10 speculation has\narrived courtesy of Weibo and Twitter tipster Ice Universe, with the crystal\nball gazer offering up the following by way of early insight.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThis suggests that the Galaxy S10 will be headlined by an all-new Infinity\nDisplay that touts an impressive screen-to-body ratio of 93% – up from the\n83.6% found on the [Galaxy S8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-\ngalaxy-s8) and S9.\n\nIt also hints – and this can almost be considered a given, in light of\nSamsung’s launch history – that the S10 will pack a new-gen Samsung Exynos\nchipset in the EMEA region, whilst coming with a Snapdragon 855 SoC in North\nAmerica.\n\nElsewhere, the S10 is tipped to offer support out of the box for UFS 3.0 – a\nstandard of Univeral Flash Storage (UFS) that’s twice as fast as UFS 2.0 – and\n[5G](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/what-is-5g-vs-4g-2911748) mobile\nconnectivity.\n\nThere’s also a chance the Plus-sized model will come with a dual-camera on the\nfront, with the intention of delivering greater depth of field (or bokeh)\neffects for selfies. The additional sensor could also be used to improve the\nhandset’s face-recognition feature.\n\nNow, let’s talk about when the Galaxy S10 and S10 Plus are likely to be\nreleased.\n\n**Related:[Best Android apps](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nandroid-apps)**\n\n### The Top Samsung Galaxy S9 Deals Right Now\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=422&clickref=TR-\nGalaxyS9&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.e2save.com%2Fcontract%2Fsamsung%2Fsamsung-\ngalaxy-s9-black%3Ftariffcode%3DDD1YEFEB18%26giftcode%3DNA16)\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=422&clickref=TR-\nGalaxyS9&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.e2save.com%2Fcontract%2Fsamsung%2Fsamsung-\ngalaxy-s9-black%3Ftariffcode%3DDD1YEFEB18%26giftcode%3DNA16)\n\n###\n\n[ Samsung Galaxy S9 – 4GB, £23pm, £100 upfront from Vodafone (use code EPICTEN\nto save £10)\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=422&clickref=TR-\nGalaxyS9&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.e2save.com%2Fcontract%2Fsamsung%2Fsamsung-\ngalaxy-s9-black%3Ftariffcode%3DDD1YEFEB18%26giftcode%3DNA16)\n\ne2save has come out with this brilliantly affordable contract for the Galaxy\nS9, made even better with a £10 discount when using the code EPICTEN.\n\n[e2save\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=422&clickref=TR-\nGalaxyS9&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.e2save.com%2Fcontract%2Fsamsung%2Fsamsung-\ngalaxy-s9-black%3Ftariffcode%3DDD1YEFEB18%26giftcode%3DNA16)\n\n|\n\n£110 upfront w/code\n\n|\n\nNow £23pm\n\n[View\nDeal](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=422&clickref=TR-\nGalaxyS9&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.e2save.com%2Fcontract%2Fsamsung%2Fsamsung-\ngalaxy-s9-black%3Ftariffcode%3DDD1YEFEB18%26giftcode%3DNA16)\n\nNow £23pm\n\n|\n\n£110 upfront w/code\n\n|\n\n[e2save\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=422&clickref=TR-\nGalaxyS9&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.e2save.com%2Fcontract%2Fsamsung%2Fsamsung-\ngalaxy-s9-black%3Ftariffcode%3DDD1YEFEB18%26giftcode%3DNA16)\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=3202&clickref=TR-\nBestMobileDeals&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fsamsung%2Fgalaxy-s9-black%3Fcontracts%3D1)\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=3202&clickref=TR-\nBestMobileDeals&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fsamsung%2Fgalaxy-s9-black%3Fcontracts%3D1)\n\n###\n\n[Samsung Galaxy S9 – 30GB, £36pm, no upfront from Vodafone\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=3202&clickref=TR-\nBestMobileDeals&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fsamsung%2Fgalaxy-s9-black%3Fcontracts%3D1)\n\n30GB of data and no upfront cost for only £36pm?
