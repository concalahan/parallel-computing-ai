Brownlee says the line appeared ‘out of nowhere’ and no amount of\nresetting would get rid of it.\n\n> I’m not about to make an entire video, but RIP this Pixel 3 XL. My screen\njust got this permanent pink line of dead pixels down the middle out of\nnowhere. Wtf [pic.twitter.com/CcbyEmE2G8](https://t.co/CcbyEmE2G8)\n\n>\n\n> — Marques Brownlee (@MKBHD) [October 24,\n2018](https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/1055112333209550848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nThe reviewer, who has a whopping 2.96m followers on Twitter, speculates it may\nbe down to the Samsung panels used on the device. While Brownlee says it may\nbe a limited quality control issue, his following is exactly the kind of tech\nenthusiast Google is hoping to attract with its Pixel handsets.\n\nIn all likelihood this is a largely isolated occurrence, but it isn’t a good\nlook for the company whose phones have been overwhelming critical successes\nthat haven’t exactly translated into big box office numbers.\n\n**Related:[Google Pixel 3 vs Pixel\n2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-pixel-3-vs-pixel-2-3601728)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nBrownlee’s issue comes after reviewers commented on the terrible audio quality\nin video recordings. In side-by-side comparisons with the iPhone XS, recording\nquality sounded tinny and distant. Google says it has tuned the Pixel 3\nmicrophones in order to minimise background noise and emphasise the spoken\nword. That may be the case, but the end result of that tuning is bad sound.\n\nIn a statement, Google said: “We made several advances in the audio recording\ncapabilities of Pixel 3, including enabling stereo recording in landscape\nmode. When recording outdoors, our tuning is specifically designed to reduce\nbackground noise like wind and road noise and overly loud sounds and optimize\nfor audible speech. To achieve this, we selectively de-emphasize some\nfrequencies, which minimizes disruptive noises and optimizes the resulting\naudio. We do extensive user testing of our products to ensure they are tuned\nfor real world usage, and we’re always looking at additional tuning\nopportunities based on user feedback.”\n\n**Are you an early Pixel 3 or Pixel 3 XL adopter?
