After\nall, we’ve been seeing ever-thinner bezels on Android phones for what feels\nlike an age now.\n\nIt all started with the [Galaxy\nS8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s8), and with\nSamsung having made few changes with the Galaxy S9, those similarities remain.\nOn the Galaxy S9, Samsung has shaved off even more of the bezel, making the\ntop and bottom of even thinner. Some bezel remains at the top to house the\ncameras and sensors.\n\nApple’s approach is slightly different, and somewhat more contentious. Its\nscreen goes right to the edge of the phone’s top frame, but there’s a cutout\narea – or ‘notch’, as it’s colloquially known – for the camera and sensors.\nSamsung famously mocked this design choice in comedic videos last year.\n‘Notches’ are becoming more common among Android phones, but we’re happy to\nsee that Samsung hasn’t followed suit.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### How to create a haunted smart Halloween home\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/create-haunted-smart-halloween-\nhome-3613611 \"How to create a haunted smart Halloween home\")\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Exclusive: Red Dead Redemption 2 leak reveals Battle Royale, first-person\nand much more\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/red-dead-redemption-2-leak-reveals-\nbattle-royale-first-person-more-3388634 \"Exclusive: Red Dead Redemption 2 leak\nreveals Battle Royale, first-person and much more\")\n\n  * \n\n  * \n\nThe fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy S9 sits below the camera on the rear.\nIt’s better placed, but remains fiddly to use and is very small. The Galaxy S9\nalso includes face and iris unlock as a rival to Apple’s clever Face ID sign-\nin system. Apple’s Face ID offers the more complete solution – you can’t use\nyour irises for Google Play payments, for example – but of course there’s no\nTouch ID sensor anymore.\n\n### Top iPhone X deals right now\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=3202&clickref=TR-\nBestMobileDeals&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fapple%2Fiphone-x-64gb-\nspace-grey)\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=3202&clickref=TR-\nBestMobileDeals&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fapple%2Fiphone-x-64gb-\nspace-grey)\n\n###\n\n[iPhone X 64GB – 60GB of data on EE\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=3202&clickref=TR-\nBestMobileDeals&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fapple%2Fiphone-x-64gb-\nspace-grey)\n\nWith 60GB in your pocket each month, you'll never be left scrounging for any\ndata, plus, with no upfront costs there's a lot to love about this contract\nfrom EE.\n\n[Buymobiles.net\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=3202&clickref=TR-\nBestMobileDeals&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fapple%2Fiphone-x-64gb-\nspace-grey)\n\n|\n\nNo upfront\n\n|\n\nNow £58/month\n\n[View\nDeal](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=3202&clickref=TR-\nBestMobileDeals&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fapple%2Fiphone-x-64gb-\nspace-grey)\n\nNow £58/month\n\n|\n\nNo upfront\n\n|\n\n[Buymobiles.net\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=3202&clickref=TR-\nBestMobileDeals&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fapple%2Fiphone-x-64gb-\nspace-grey)\n\n**Related:**[ **Best Samsung Galaxy S9\ndeals**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-samsung-\ngalaxy-s9-deals-3402357)\n\n![Samsung Galaxy\nS9](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nBoth phones feature 5.8-inch OLED screens; Samsung’s is a Super AMOLED. Of the\ntwo, Samsung’s S9 has a higher-resolution 2960 x 1440 display, resulting in a\n570ppi pixel density. The iPhone X makes do with a 2436 x 1125 OLED, for a\npixel density of 458ppi. Both phones can display HDR content from Netflix, but\nAmazon Prime and YouTube HDR support is limited to the Galaxy S9.\n\nBoth displays are stunning, and comfortably the best on the market today.\nSamsung’s panel wins for colour vibrancy and saturation, while Apple’s feels\nmore comfortable on the eyes with its warmer hues. Apple’s True Tone tech\nalters the colour temperature of the display according to the surrounding the\nenvironment and it’s a feature we’d love to see on some Android phones.\n\nThe glass rear of the iPhone X makes it feel great in the hand, whereas the\nGalaxy S9 similarly is made from premium materials befitting its price. The\niPhone X makes do with IP67 dust- and water-resistance, whereas the Galaxy S9\nis slightly more resilient with an IP68 rating. This basically means the\nGalaxy S8 can survive depths of 1.5 metres for 30 minutes, whereas the iPhone\nX can manage only 1 metre for the same time.\n\nThe addition of a glass back on the iPhone X means that it supports wireless\ncharging, and this is supported by the Galaxy S9, too. The iPhone X has no\nheadphone jack, so you’ll need to use a Lightning adapter, but the headphone\njack remains with the Galaxy S9.\n\nSamsung is doing some interesting things with its speakers. On the S9 they’re\nfront-facing and tuned by AKG, plus they support Dolby Atmos for a pseudo\nsurround-sound effect. We still think the speakers on the iPhone X are better\n– sound is richer and doesn’t distort at high volumes – but the S9’s speakers\noffer a huge improvement over older models.\n\n### Virgin Media Business Deal\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7193&awinaffid=!!!277673!!!&clickref=tr-\nvirginmediabusiness&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.virginmediabusiness.co.uk%2Fconnectivity%2Fbusiness-\nmobile%2Fdevices%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s9-plus%2Fbroadband-and-mobile-\nawin%2F%3FCMP%3Dadi_affil-mar-0001820_digital-4378%20)\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7193&awinaffid=!!!277673!!!&clickref=tr-\nvirginmediabusiness&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.virginmediabusiness.co.uk%2Fconnectivity%2Fbusiness-\nmobile%2Fdevices%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s9-plus%2Fbroadband-and-mobile-\nawin%2F%3FCMP%3Dadi_affil-mar-0001820_digital-4378%20)\n\n###\n\n[Voom Fibre 3 Business Broadband + Samsung Galaxy S9+ w/ 32GB of data\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7193&awinaffid=!!!277673!!!&clickref=tr-\nvirginmediabusiness&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.virginmediabusiness.co.uk%2Fconnectivity%2Fbusiness-\nmobile%2Fdevices%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s9-plus%2Fbroadband-and-mobile-\nawin%2F%3FCMP%3Dadi_affil-mar-0001820_digital-4378%20)\n\nYou can save £25 a month when signing up for Voom Fibre 3 Business Broadband\nwith a superb Samsung Galaxy S9+ and generous 32GB of data.\n\n[Virgin Media Business\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7193&awinaffid=!!!277673!!!&clickref=tr-\nvirginmediabusiness&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.virginmediabusiness.co.uk%2Fconnectivity%2Fbusiness-\nmobile%2Fdevices%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s9-plus%2Fbroadband-and-mobile-\nawin%2F%3FCMP%3Dadi_affil-mar-0001820_digital-4378%20)\n\n[View\nDeal](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7193&awinaffid=!!!277673!!!&clickref=tr-\nvirginmediabusiness&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.virginmediabusiness.co.uk%2Fconnectivity%2Fbusiness-\nmobile%2Fdevices%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s9-plus%2Fbroadband-and-mobile-\nawin%2F%3FCMP%3Dadi_affil-mar-0001820_digital-4378%20)\n\n[Virgin Media Business\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7193&awinaffid=!!!277673!!!&clickref=tr-\nvirginmediabusiness&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.virginmediabusiness.co.uk%2Fconnectivity%2Fbusiness-\nmobile%2Fdevices%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s9-plus%2Fbroadband-and-mobile-\nawin%2F%3FCMP%3Dadi_affil-mar-0001820_digital-4378%20)\n\n## **Samsung Galaxy S9 vs Apple iPhone X specs – Which phone is more\npowerful?**\n\nUnfortunately, comparing an iPhone to an Android phone for performance is a\nlittle like comparing apples (ha) to oranges. Especially since iPhones run\nApple’s own iOS operating system, which is tailored to take advantage of the\nhardware. What we do know is that both phones aren’t lacking for performance.\n\n![iPhone\nX](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: Max Parker – Trusted Reviews\n\nThe Galaxy S9, as is usual for Samsung, will be available with either the new\nQualcomm Snapdragon 845 or its own[ Samsung Exynos\n9810](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-exynos-9810-specs-\nbenchmarks-phones-galaxy-s9-3365910) chip, depending on where you buy it.\n\nIn our benchmarking tests, the iPhone X scored **4257** in the single-core\ntest and **10,364** in the multi-core Geekbench 4 test. In the same test, the\nExynos-toting Galaxy S9 scored **8424 and 2472**. Benchmarking tests are fine\nfor giving an overall view, but real-world performance is far more important.\nBoth phones feel quick in day-to-day use and can handle every single app in\ntheir respective app stores. We do, however, feel the iPhone X is reliably\nsmoother.\n\nIn terms of RAM, the iPhone X is equipped with 3GB, whereas the Galaxy S9\npacks in 4GB. iOS and Android handle RAM differently, so a bigger number\ndoesn’t necessarily equate to better performance in this case.\n\nBoth phones can be bought with either 64GB or 256GB of built-in storage, but\nthe Galaxy S9 sees the return of a microSD slot, which supports cards up to\n400GB. This offers a much cheaper way to expand storage if you want to opt for\nthe cheaper model with less built-in storage.\n\n### The Top Samsung Galaxy S9 Deals Right Now\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=422&clickref=TR-\nGalaxyS9&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.e2save.com%2Fcontract%2Fsamsung%2Fsamsung-\ngalaxy-s9-black%3Ftariffcode%3DDD1YEFEB18%26giftcode%3DNA16)\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=422&clickref=TR-\nGalaxyS9&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.e2save.com%2Fcontract%2Fsamsung%2Fsamsung-\ngalaxy-s9-black%3Ftariffcode%3DDD1YEFEB18%26giftcode%3DNA16)\n\n###\n\n[Samsung Galaxy S9 – 4GB, £23pm, £100 upfront from Vodafone (use code EPICTEN\nto save £10)\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=422&clickref=TR-\nGalaxyS9&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.e2save.com%2Fcontract%2Fsamsung%2Fsamsung-\ngalaxy-s9-black%3Ftariffcode%3DDD1YEFEB18%26giftcode%3DNA16)\n\ne2save has come out with this brilliantly affordable contract for the Galaxy\nS9, made even better with a £10 discount when using the code EPICTEN.\n\n[e2save\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=422&clickref=TR-\nGalaxyS9&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.e2save.com%2Fcontract%2Fsamsung%2Fsamsung-\ngalaxy-s9-black%3Ftariffcode%3DDD1YEFEB18%26giftcode%3DNA16)\n\n|\n\n£110 upfront w/code\n\n|\n\nNow £23pm\n\n[View\nDeal](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=422&clickref=TR-\nGalaxyS9&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.e2save.com%2Fcontract%2Fsamsung%2Fsamsung-\ngalaxy-s9-black%3Ftariffcode%3DDD1YEFEB18%26giftcode%3DNA16)\n\nNow £23pm\n\n|\n\n£110 upfront w/code\n\n|\n\n[e2save\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=422&clickref=TR-\nGalaxyS9&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.e2save.com%2Fcontract%2Fsamsung%2Fsamsung-\ngalaxy-s9-black%3Ftariffcode%3DDD1YEFEB18%26giftcode%3DNA16)\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=3202&clickref=TR-\nBestMobileDeals&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fsamsung%2Fgalaxy-s9-black%3Fcontracts%3D1)\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=3202&clickref=TR-\nBestMobileDeals&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fsamsung%2Fgalaxy-s9-black%3Fcontracts%3D1)\n\n###\n\n[Samsung Galaxy S9 – 30GB, £36pm, no upfront from Vodafone\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=3202&clickref=TR-\nBestMobileDeals&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fsamsung%2Fgalaxy-s9-black%3Fcontracts%3D1)\n\n30GB of data and no upfront cost for only £36pm?

Things are very different when it comes to the\nlenses, however. The iPhone X has a dual-lens setup, with the wider lens\nhaving a f/1.8 aperture and the telephoto lens a f/2.4 aperture. Both support\noptical image stabilisation.\n\nHaving both a wide and zoom lens affords greater freedom when framing shots;\nresorting to a digital zoom often reduces image quality. The large f/1.8\naperture on the iPhone X allows it decent low-light performance by letting\nmore light reach the sensor, but without slowing down the shutter speed and\nintroducing camera shake.\n\nThe Galaxy S9 has only the one lens (unless you choose the Plus model), and\ntherefore less zoom versatility. But the S9’s clever trick is a variable\nmechanical aperture between f/1.5 and f/2.4. Like a lens on a DSLR, it can\nopen or close its diaphragm to let more light reach the sensor. The f/1.5\naperture will provide more light than the iPhone X’s f/1.8, for example. But\nthe variable aperture will also have an effect on ‘bokeh’, which is the\nbackground blur that helps separate your subject from the background.\n\n![iPhone X\ncamera](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe S9’s variable aperture shouldn’t be confused with the software-based faux-\naperture adjustments seen on rival phones from Huawei or Google’s Pixel\nphones. Having an actual mechanical aperture is a real engineering feat – and\na first for a smartphone camera. It means the Galaxy S9 can better adapt to\nlight conditions.\n\nSpecs are one thing, but a good camera needs to take good pictures. Let’s\nstart by saying that both phones take very good photos whether you’re shooting\nin well-lit rooms or dingy bars. Detail across both is great and the focusing\nsystems are fast and accurate.\n\nBut in terms of pure photo quality, we think the iPhone X captures the better\npicture. Just. The Galaxy S9 tends to overexpose images; we often found it\nboosted the light parts of the photo too much. There’s also a lot of\nprocessing going on when the photo is taken and this results in smoothed-out\nedges.\n\n### Trusted Reviews Exclusive iPhone XS Deal\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n###\n\n[Apple iPhone XS – 10GB, £40pm with £350 upfront on O2\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\nGiving you plenty of data for the low price of just £40 a month, this monthly\ncontract with O2 is an incredible deal that can't be missed if you want to be\none of the first people to own an iPhone XS.\n\n[Mobiles.co.uk\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n|\n\n£350 upfront\n\n|\n\n£40/month\n\n[View\nDeal](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n£40/month\n\n|\n\n£350 upfront\n\n|\n\n[Mobiles.co.uk\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n![Samsung Galaxy\nS9](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe Galaxy S9 and iPhone X both take decent low-light shots, but again, the\nS9’s images can feature overly boosted colours but lack realistic details.\n\nHowever, where the S9 does impress is in the sheer number of options and\nfeatures packed into the camera app. It shoots 960fps slow-motion video (the\niPhone X caps at 240), has a full ‘Pro’ mode for granular control, and plenty\nmore. Both phones can shoot 4K UHD video at 60fps.\n\n## **Samsung Galaxy S9 vs Apple iPhone X – Price**\n\nThe iPhone X is Apple’s most expensive phone yet. Prices start at £999 for the\n64GB model and £1149 for the 256GB option. Prices for the Samsung Galaxy S9,\non the other hand, will start at £739 for the 64GB model, undercutting the\niPhone X by a considerable margin. It’s quite a jump to the 256GB model, at\n£869.\n\n## **Samsung Galaxy S9 vs Apple iPhone X – Verdict**\n\nThese are two superb handset that are strong flagships for their respective\noperating systems. The iPhone X was huge step in the right direction for\nApple, and while the S9 is certainly a minor update, it remains a great phone.\n\nThe S9 wins on price – although both are expensive – and sheer number of\nfeatures (microSD, headphone jack, USB-C), but we think the iPhone X has the\nbetter camera.\n\n**Let us know your thoughts on which phone you think is best in the comments\nbelow.**\n\n"}
