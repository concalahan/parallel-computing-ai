Here’s everything you need\nto know about what was announced today, as well as some rumours about what we\nthought was going to be announced prior to the April 24 Spotify event.**\n\nInitially, we suspected that the event would focus around the announcement of\na new piece of hardware, possibly a [Spotify smart\nspeaker](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/spotify-device-release-date-news-\nfeatures-speaker-wearable-3448612), before a teaser for the event included the\nwords, “Hear what’s next for our mobile app”, implying that it would be a\nsoftware-focused presentation.\n\n“What’s next” for the mobile app, it turned out, was an entirely new app aimed\nat its free tier users powered by a whole lot of machine learning and AI. The\ncompany announced that it will be using the technology to automatically\ngenerate playlists for its users in an attempt to take on the traditional\nradio broadcasting industry. Users will get unlimited access to 750 tracks\nfrom 15 top playlists (including Discover Weekly), which isn’t nearly as much\nas they could get through paying for the service, but it’s still a big step up\nconsidering they’ll get unlimited ‘skips’ and will be able to pick songs\ndirectly.\n\nSpotify’s app hasn’t seen a major upgrade since 2016 when it [ditched the\n‘hamburger’ menu button](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/spotify-ios-\napp-update-download-new-interface-2938957) in favour of a menu bar across the\nbottom of the app, and it sounds like things are going to stay that way for\nthe time being. The new functionality was only discussed in relation to the\nnew app, which will be focused on the needs of free users.\n\n**Related:[Spotify vs Apple\nMusic](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/spotify-vs-apple-music-best-\nstreaming-service-2913394)**\n\n## Spotify Event As It Happened: All the news news from Spotify’s free app\nupdate event in New York\n\n_**This event has now concluded, but our full report is below. Alternatively,\nscroll down for what we had hoped to see at Spotify’s April event.**_\n\nToday’s Spotify event in New York kicked-off at 2.30pm BST, or 9.30am local\ntime in New York, where the launch is being held.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThe first announcement made by the streaming service was that the company will\nbe introducing ‘self-driving playlists’ that will utilise machine learning to\ngenerate playlists. Spotify hopes that this feature will allow it to take on\ntraditional broadcast radio in addition to challenging the traditional record\nstore as it has done in the past.\n\nThese new playlists will be available through a brand new free mobile app,\nwhich the company expects its 90 million free tier users to make use of.\n\nSpotify promised that this new app will be a big upgrade for free users,\nbringing their experience much closer to the premium tier. They’ll get\nunlimited free listening to 750 tracks from 15 top playlists, which is over 40\nhours of listening. Users can select exact tracks to listen to within these\nplaylists, rather than being forced to rely on shuffle, and can skip as many\ntimes as they want.\n\nThe new app is designed to be lightweight, and the firm is promising that it\nwill consume up to 75% less mobile data if they turn on the ‘Data Saver’ mode.\n\nPlaylist generation starts when you first open up the new app. It will ask you\nto list your favourite artists so it knows what music you’re into. After that\npoint, the app’s home screen will be populated with Daily Mixes and curated\nplaylists based on your preferences.\n\nHowever, if you’d like to curate your own playlist then Spotify will help you\ndo so by suggesting similar songs you might want to add.\n\nThe new app will be rolled out globally in the coming weeks.\n\nSo far the company has announced no changes to its Premium, £9.99 a month,\nservice.\n\nSpotify sees its free tier as being key to attracting new, young users who\ncan’t afford a monthly subscription. However, through exposing them to new\nmusic, the company hopes to broaden their musical horizons while also\nencouraging them to pay for the service.\n\n_**There were plenty of rumours swirling before the event began about what the\ncompany was expected to announce. Read on below for everything that we hoped\nwould happen.**_\n\n## **Spotify Event Rumour #1: Voice control**\n\nWe were fairly sure that we’d see some kind of voice control announcement out\nof the event. Recently, select users found that a new ‘mic’ icon had appeared\nfor them in the Spotify app, and pressing it allowed them to control and\nsearch for music using just their voice.\n\nSpotify has supported the likes of Alexa and Google Assistant in the past, but\nbuilding its own voice control functionality would allow it to offer a deeper\nlevel of integration by letting people access advanced features like Daily\nMixes.\n\nThen again, these voice control tests could have been done in advance of\nSpotify announcing its own piece of hardware, which was also absent from the\nevent.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Spotify Event Rumour #2: Higher quality streaming\n\nThis is something that we’ve wanted forever. Tidal has offered CD-quality\n16-bit/44.1kHz streams since its inception, and Deezer got the upgrade late\nlast year. Meanwhile, Spotify tops out at just 320kbps. This isn’t set to\nchange any time soon according to the event.\n\nInitially, we could excuse the lack of CD-quality streams because the internet\nwasn’t fast enough for most people to be able to stream it — especially on\nmobile.\n\nBut in more recent years this is no longer the case, as shown by the number of\nSpotify’s competitors that are now offering high quality streams.\n\nSpotify has experimented with high quality streaming in the past in some\nlimited tests last year, but so far the functionality has stayed in the\ntesting phase.\n\nOf course, in an ideal world Spotify would follow its competitors into\noffering hi-res streaming, but one step at a time right guys?\n\n## Spotify Event (April 2018): What we wanted to see from the Spotify update\n\n### Make it easier to download music\n\nIt wasn’t something that was specifically rumoured, but if Spotify was\nupdating its app then we figured it would be a great opportunity to simplify\nthe process of downloading music for offline listening. However, with no\nupdate to the main app detailed, no changes to offline listening are expected.\n\nIn an ideal world, we’d all always have the internet available to stream music\nto our heart’s delight, but the likes of flights and underground commuting\nmean that in reality some offline listening will occasionally be required.\n\nThe good news is that Spotify has allowed its premium subscribers to download\nmusic for some time now, but the bad news is that the process of doing so is\nhorribly cumbersome, involving first ‘saving’ a song or album, and then having\nto download it as part of a batch using a toggle switch at the top of a\nplaylist.\n\nIt’s clunky and horrible, and we’d much prefer an easy-to-access button to let\nus download tracks directly.\n\n**Related:[Best Bluetooth\nspeakers](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/bluetooth-speakers-3431819)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### **A better offline experience overall**\n\nYou know what, if you’re fixing the process of downloading music then it would\nbe great to also change up how you go about listening to music when you don’t\nhave an internet connection.\n\nAt the moment, there’s no easy way to find your offline music without\nspecifically toggling Spotify’s offline mode from the settings menu, which\nseems strange when it would be so easy for the app to auto-detect when there’s\nno connection.\n\nIt’s even harder when you’re travelling abroad and you want to limit the\namount of data you’re using even though the Spotify app technically has a\nconnection it could use to stream.\n\n**Related:[Best headphones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nheadphones)**\n\nIf we could get a dedicated menu entry in the ‘Your Library’ tab for offline\nmusic then that would be an enormous step forward.\n\n**What were you expecting to see at Spotify’s event, and what do you think the\ncompany needs to fix about its app?
