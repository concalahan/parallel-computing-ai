{"result": 0, "title": "Apple Watch Review | Trusted Reviews", "description": "* ![]()The rectangular versus circular screen debate continues to divide and we’dstill side with the more traditional approach. But the Apple Watch is the mostconvincing argument for a ‘smartphone inspired’ screen on a phone.The 1.7-inch screen has 322 pixels per inch and it’s right up there with theSamsung Gear Live for sharpness, colour accuracy and brightness. Whites have aslight blueish tint, but it’s virtually impossible to notice on such a smallscreen. Visibility is fantastic, as well. Day or night, you won’t have tosquint to read it and it copes well in bright sunlight.Another aspect of the screen is Force Touch – it’s one of the most interestingfeatures on the Watch. It essentially forms part of the screen technology andmakes it possible to detect the difference between light and hard presses onthe screen. There’s nothing really like it on other smartwatches and while ittakes some playing around to work out the apps compatible with it, it’s aclever way to add extra functionality to apps without having to overcomplicate the user interface or add more physical buttons.We’d say Samsung’s smartwatch screens remain the pinnacle, but Apple’s not toofar behind for overall quality.[ Next  Software & Using the Watch ](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/apple-watch-software-using-the-watch-page-2)"}
