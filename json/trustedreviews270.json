Even more so because\nbenchmarks can be misleading anyway, and AnTuTu scores aren’t necessarily\nrepresentative of a real-world usage environment.\n\nIf the benchmark readout isn’t spurious however, it suggests that the LG Nexus\n5 could be one of the most powerful smartphones we’ve ever seen.\n\nAs such, it wouldn’t be too surprising to see the device carrying Qualcomm’s\nupcoming Snapdragon 820 chip, which currently doesn’t appear on any\nsmartphones.\n\n**Related:** [Best Android Smartphones\n2015](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-android-phones-1_round-up)\n\nSo what else do we know about the LG Nexus 5 (2015)? Not much, unfortunately,\nsave for that it might have a 5.2-inch display and a battery of 2,700mAh.\n\nIt’s also rumoured that Huawei is also working on a Nexus device for Google,\nalbeit with a 6-inch display instead.\n\nIf you’re in the market for something more tangible, check out our smartphone\ngroup test video below:\n\n"}
