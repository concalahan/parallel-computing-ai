Quite the boast considering how many WW2\ntitles we’ve all played over the past few decades.\n\nHowever, while Call of Duty also recently went ‘back to its roots’ with a\nrather damp and buggy effort, Battlefield V so far shows some promise. The\nprevious entry in this series (confusingly named ‘Battlefield 1’) was heralded\nas one of the best shooters – nay, one of the best PC games – of 2016. And it\nappears so far that this fifth title will continue the good work, with\nsprawling online battles and a story-driven single-player campaign.\n\nWe had the chance to spend some time with the limited Alpha release to see how\nBattlefield V is shaping up and this is what we think so far.\n\n## Battlefield 5 – Alpha Gameplay Preview\n\nThe limited-time Alpha release didn’t feature any of the solo campaign, but I\nwas able to dive into one of the frantic multiplayer games (which can house up\nto 64 players in total).\n\nBattles in this Alpha version are pretty straightforward. Players are split\ninto two teams (Germans and English) and given opposing objectives. For\ninstance, the English side might have to destroy four marked structures in a\nset time limit, while the Germans have to defend them.\n\nIn certain maps, the attacking side is forced to parachute into enemy\nterritory at the beginning of a match. This can be quite a nail-biting\nexperience, as you’re disturbingly exposed and vulnerable the entire time you\nfloat to the ground. As this isn’t Duke Nukem, you can’t fire off rounds or\nrockets at your opponents until you safely land. Thankfully you can at least\npick your moment to jump from the plane, so the decision is yours; leap out\nearly and avoid being sniped on your fall, but end up miles from your\ndestination? Or brave waiting until you’re right over your target, as well as\na high concentration of enemy soldiers?\n\nWith such sprawling maps covered in brush, ruins and hidey holes, you might\nworry about how difficult it is to spot the enemy. Thankfully, they’re clearly\ndistinguished from your teammates, who sport large coloured dots over their\nnoggins – so you won’t go pumping a full clip into your buddy’s rear end by\naccident. Once you spy someone on the opposition, they’re briefly marked with\na red icon over their heads. This swiftly disappears if they duck behind\ncover, however, so you can’t track them through walls and other barriers.\n\n**Related:[Upcoming PS4 Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/upcoming-\nps4-games) **\n\n![Battlefield\n5](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nOne of the first things I picked up on was the effectiveness of machine guns\nin Battlefield V. At first I played as a sniper until I realised that\nautomatic weapons have a really strong range on them. With tidy, controlled\nbursts, you’ll have a clear advantage over any snipers (as long as you aren’t\nmiles away), thanks to your far superior fire rate.\n\nThat said, the second thing that I picked up in Battlefield V was that you\ncan’t go nuts and spray ammo like confetti at a wedding. You only begin with a\nclip or two at best if you’re infantry, while snipers pack a measly ten\nbullets. In other words, you have to be damn sure that someone’s locked in\nyour crosshairs before pulling that trigger. You can restock ammunition at the\noccasional stash or if you have a helpful buddy, but you don’t want to depend\non that when you’re locked in battle. Basically, every bullet absolutely has\nto count.\n\nBattlefield leans toward realism when it comes to how much damage you can\ntake. Just one or two hits can put you down if your enemy aims right, while\ndeath can come from any direction at pretty much any point. There’s a very\nreal sense of danger, to keep your heart rate high throughout.\n\n**Related:[Best Xbox One Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-xbox-\none-games-3435271)**\n\n![Battlefield\n5](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nMedics can revive any fallen comrades by moving next to them, although you’ll\nhave to be quick. After someone goes down, they expire in just a few short\nseconds without any medical attention. When a player is critically injured,\nthey can at least cry out for help with a tap of the left mouse button to\nattract the attention of any nearby allies.\n\nHearing your buddies screech in pain is like a slug to the gut, but reviving\nthem really is risky business. Medics are completely exposed for the time it\ntakes to bring someone back to life, so you’re best off dealing with the\nthreat before jumping in to help. It’s frantic, for sure.\n\nOf course, if one of your chums does cop it, they can simply respawn again\nnext to one of their teammates after a short period. And while that helps to\nalleviate any real frustration at being slaughtered on the battlefield, it\nalso kills quite a lot of the tension.\n\nThere are also a handful of vehicles which can be scavenged and driven. Tanks\nand armored cars help you to cover large distances in a jiffy, although\nthey’re also clear targets for any enemy grenades and similarly heavy\nfirepower.\n\n## Battlefield 5 – Alpha Presentation and Bugs\n\nSo far, the presentation of Battlefield V seems to be well on track. Audio\nquality is already fantastic when enjoyed with a good pair of surround sound\nheadphones.\n\nCrawling through the mud, I could make out the sounds of bullets flying past\nand thudding into the ground, while explosions rippled all around me. Being\nstuck in the middle of a no-holds-barred gunfight is an absolutely terrifying\naural experience.\n\nLikewise, graphics are crisp and detailed, if not particularly mind-blowing.\nEvery battlefield is littered with debris and destruction and looks\nimpressively realistic, while backgrounds are seamlessly integrated.\n\nLook around and you’ll spot very distant crumbling structures, which look as\nif they could actually be reached if you were to just set off in that\ndirection. That impressive scope gives Battlefield V an immersive quality that\nfew other multiplayer shooters can match.\n\n**Related:[Best PS4\nGames](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/ps4-games-3431751)**\n\n**![Battlefield\n5](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)**\n\nOf course, in this limited Alpha version, you’re seriously restricted in what\nyou can do. Very few game modes are available, while weapon and item choices\nare limited to just one or – if you’re lucky – a pair of offerings.\n\nIt’s no surprise that in this Alpha form, the game is also quite buggy.\nOccasionally, I and my teammates had trouble spawning, while it’s reasonably\ncommon to see dropped weapons spinning magically in the air. Still, the game\nholds together well even in this early form and I’m intrigued to see how the\nfinal product turns out.\n\n## Battlefield 5 System Requirements – What will I need?\n\nElectronic Arts has revealed the minimum system requirements for Battlefield 5\nnow the closed alpha is available to select players. In a nutshell, if your\nrig could run Battlefield 1, you’ll run into few problems here.\n\nWe’ve listed the full list of specifications below:\n\n**OS:** 64-bit Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10  \n**Processor (AMD):** AMD FX-6350  \n**Processor (Intel):** Core i5 6600K  \n**Memory:** 8GB RAM  \n**Graphics card (AMD):** AMD Radeon™ HD 7850 2GB  \n**Graphics card (NVIDIA):** nVidia GeForce® GTX 660 2GB  \n**DirectX:** 11.0 Compatible video card or equivalent  \n**Online Connection Requirements:** 512 KBPS or faster Internet connection  \n**Hard-drive space:** 50GB\n\n**Related:[Best Nintendo Switch\nGames](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/nintendo-switch-games-3435122)**\n\n![Battlefield\n5](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\n## Battlefield 5 War Stories – What are they?\n\nWar Stories makes a return from Battlefield 1. This time around the intention\nis to give an insight into some of the lesser-known conflicts of World War 2.\n\nThe first one DICE has discussed is titled ‘Nordlys’ (Norwegian for Northern\nLights). Set in Norway in 1943 during German occupation, it tells the story of\na young woman who must make the ultimate sacrifice in order to save her\nfamily.\n\nHopefully DICE can replicate some of the excellent storytelling seen in\nBattlefield 1, but with more content to keep players returning over the course\nof Battlfield 5’s life cycle.\n\n## Battlefield 5 Battle Royale – It’s called Firestorm\n\nAn extensive new trailer for Battlefield 5 finally reveals new details on the\nshooter’s battle royale experience. Known as Firestorm, it will feature 64\nplayers split into 16 squads of four. You can expect the chaotic gunplay,\ndestructibility and vehicular combat the series is known for, too.\n\n**Related:[Fallout 76\nPreview](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/fallout-76)**\n\n![Battlefield\n5](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\n## Battlefield 5 Tides of War – How does it work?\n\nTides of War is Battlefield 5’s new metagame that will exist across the whole\nexperience. For the first time in the series, you will be able to customise\nsoldiers, vehicles and weapons by unlocking new skins and apparel as you play\nthe game.\n\nEach player will have their own “Company”, a group of soldiers that will level\nup and progress along with them. You can specialise your character classes via\nprogression to suit your own playstyle. You unlock new gear by playing the\ngame, and this gear creates a unique look for your Company.\n\nIn the presentation, the depth of the gun customisation was very impressive,\nhaving an almost CS:GO like aesthetic, and offered a great variety to each\ngun. I could certainly see the appeal of making each weapon your own. Some\nlooked incredible.\n\nDICE said these items can be unlocked via in-game currency, which it described\nas “grind currency”, a term we weren’t particularly fond of. It wasn’t noted\nwhether progression could be sped up or unlocks purchased via\nmicrotransactions.\n\nTo speed up the earning of currency, there will be Daily Orders and Special\nAssignments. The former takes less time to complete and will reward lesser\ncurrency, while the latter can take days or even a week to finish. However,\nthere will be multiple ways to complete the objective, meaning that each type\nof player is catered for, be you a player who spends their time healing\nothers, attacking enemies or taking the objective.\n\n**Related:[Anthem latest news](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/anthem-\nrelease-date-gameplay-release-date-preorder-news-2951518)**\n\n![Battlefield\n5](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\n## Battlefield 5 Season Pass – Is there one?\n\nHere’s the good news: No! EA and Dice have decided to scrap a season pass for\nthis game, following the trend of other multiplayer-centric games to offer\nfree multiplayer maps to avoid segregating the player base.\n\nMaps released post-launch will both offer historically accurate stories with\nrestricted rule sets for added realism, such as limited weapons and vehicles,\nas well as other maps that will take historical accuracy less seriously.\n\nBeing able to get free content following the initial purchase is great news\nfor gamers, but how EA mitigates this loss in the form of microtransactions\nremains to be seen.\n\n**Are you excited for Battlefield 5?
