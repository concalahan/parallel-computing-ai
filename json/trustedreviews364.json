{"result": 0, "title": "iPhone X review: Discontinued by Apple | Trusted Reviews", "description": "*   * ![iPhone X]()The iPhone X’s screen also benefits from True Tone, which alters the screentemperature depending on the environment you’re in. 3D Touch makes a return,too, allowing you to perform alternative actions on applying different levelsof pressure on the screen.Whether or not you’re a fan of the iPhone X’s display will come down to whatfeatures you value most in a screen. For me, this is the best screen on anyhandset I’ve seen. I downloaded a few HDR-enabled movies from iTunes –something you can’t do on Android – and they’re stunning. I wouldn’t normallywatch an entire film on a sub 6-inch screen, but on the iPhone X I did – and Iwasn’t distracted by the notch at all.[ Next  Performance and Software ](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-x-performance-software)"}
