At\nan event in the Steve Jobs Theatre the Cupertino-based company announced\n[Apple Watch 4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-\nwatch-4-specs-3487177), [iPhone\nXS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-xs-release-date-specs-price-\nuk-3551351), iPhone XS Max and iPhone XR. However there was no mention of\n[AirPower](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-airpower-wireless-\ncharging-release-date-price-3402369) or [AirPods\n2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-airpods-2-release-date-3402205).\n\n**Related:[iPhone XS Max\nreview](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xs-max)**\n\nThe [iPhone XR](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-xr-release-date-\nspecs-price-3579137) sits at the bottom of the new range, offering a similar\ndesign to the XS at a more ‘affordable’ price. It’s still far from cheap,\nhowever. With price starting from £749, it costs more than the [iPhone\n8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-8).\n\nThe iPhone XS and XS Max both replace the singular [iPhone\nX](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-x) from 2018 and sit at the\ntop of the range of smartphones. The XS is near-identical to the X with a\n5.8-inch display, while the XS Max is the next-generation Plus variant with a\nwhopping 6.5-inch panel. Now that we have the basics out of the way, let’s\nhave a look at how the new iPhones compare internally and externally.\n\n### Trusted Reviews Exclusive iPhone XS Deal\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n###\n\n[Apple iPhone XS – 10GB, £40pm with £350 upfront on O2\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\nGiving you plenty of data for the low price of just £40 a month, this monthly\ncontract with O2 is an incredible deal that can't be missed if you want to be\none of the first people to own an iPhone XS.\n\n[Mobiles.co.uk\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n|\n\n£350 upfront\n\n|\n\n£40/month\n\n[View\nDeal](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n£40/month\n\n|\n\n£350 upfront\n\n|\n\n[Mobiles.co.uk\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n### Best iPhone XR Deals\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=tr-\niphonexr&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xr-64gb-\nblack%3Ftariffcode%3DDD1ZMFEB18)\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=tr-\niphonexr&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xr-64gb-\nblack%3Ftariffcode%3DDD1ZMFEB18)\n\n###\n\n[Apple iPhone XR 64GB Black – 4GB of data on Vodafone (use code TRUSTED10)\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=tr-\niphonexr&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xr-64gb-\nblack%3Ftariffcode%3DDD1ZMFEB18)\n\nIf you don't mind paying an upfront cost and only need a moderate amount of\ndata a month, this contract gets you a low monthly cost.

However, we’ll have to\nproperly benchmark and use each of these new phones to really see assess how\nthey perform.\n\nApple is being tight-lipped about the amount of RAM inside each phone. Rumours\nsuggest the XS and XS Max will pack 4GB, while the iPhone XR will have 3GB.\nAgain, we’ll confirm these figures on reviewing the devices.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Spintires: Mudrunners – American Wilds Edition\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/spintires-mudrunners-american-wilds-\nedition \"Spintires: Mudrunners – American Wilds Edition\")\n\n  * [ ![Galaxy Note 10](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Best Phone 2018: 10 best smartphones revealed and rated\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-smartphone-3431175 \"Best Phone\n2018: 10 best smartphones revealed and rated\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Wooting One Keyboard](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Wooting One\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/wooting-one \"Wooting One\")\n\n  * \n\nStorage size is another differentiator between the iPhone XS and iPhone XR.\nThe XS and XS Max are available in 64GB, 256GB and 512GB variants, with the\niPhone XR available in 64GB, 128GB and 256GB options.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nArguably the biggest difference between the XR and XS is the display. The\niPhone XR comes with a 6.1-inch Liquid Retina LCD panel, while the XS uses\nSuper Retina OLED tech. It’s also available in two sizes: 5.8-inch and\n6.5-inch.\n\nWe can’t say for sure without spending time with the phones, but we’d go out\non a limb and say the OLED panels will look noticeably better. Colours on\nOLEDs are brighter and contrast is better.\n[HDR](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/hdr-tv-high-dynamic-television-\nexplained-2927035) content should also look superior thanks to the ability of\n[OLED](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/oled-vs-led-lcd-2924602) to\ndisplay perfect blacks.\n\n[iOS 12](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ios-12-devices-features-beta-\ndownload-3385158) will run on all the new iPhones, bringing features such as\nScreen Time, improved notifications and a focus on speed and performance.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n##\n\n## **iPhone XR vs iPhone XS vs iPhone XS Max – Design**\n\nAll of Apple’s new phones mimic the iPhone X’s iconic design. That means all\nthree have near edge-to-edge displays.\n\nNone have a Touch ID fingerprint sensor, instead relying on [Face\nID](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/face-id-3286453) for unlocking and\naccessing private apps. This means the notch is now commonplace across Apple’s\n2018 phone line.\n\nOther similarities include the glass rears, support for Qi [wireless\ncharging](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-wireless-charger-3505891)\nand an [IP67](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/what-is-ip68-ip-ratings-\nexplained-2947135) rating for water-resistance. It’s great to see Apple keep\nthese features similar across all phones.\n\nThere are some big differences between the devices, though. The iPhone XR is\nthe more colourful of the new phones, coming in a range of hues including\nblue, black, white, coral, yellow and red. If you plump for the iPhone XS or\niPhone XS Max then colour options are limited to silver, grey or the new gold.\n\n**Related:[AirPower](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-airpower-\nwireless-charging-release-date-price-3402369)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe phones are made up of different materials, too. The iPhone XR has\naluminium sides, while the iPhone XS and XS Max both use stainless steel.\nStainless steel is a bit shinier and has a more ‘premium’ finish.\n\nNone of the three phones has a headphone jack – something you probably should\nexpect from Apple – and it seems that Apple has removed the 3.5mm adapter from\nthe box, too.\n\n## **iPhone XR vs iPhone XS vs iPhone XS Max – Camera**\n\nApple is pushing cameras hard with these new phones, with all models\nbenefitting from at least some form of upgrade. The iPhone XS and XS Max both\nhave dual 12-megapixel cameras on the rear. One of these is an f/1.8 main\nsensor, while the other is a wide-angle sensor with an f/2.4 aperture.
