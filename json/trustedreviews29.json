As a general rule of thumb, the more you can pay upfront, theless you’ll pay overall. The overall cost is known as the total cost ofownership (TCO), and this is your monthly charge multiplied by the length ofyour contract plus the upfront cost.So a £30pm contract that lasts 24 months with a £100 upfront cost would equateto (£30 x 24) + £100 = £820.But what you’re willing to pay upfront will be down to personal circumstance.It’s not the end of the world paying slightly more after two years if that’sthe difference between having the smartphone of your dreams… and not.### How much data do you need?Data is the biggest differentiator between one tariff and the next.

Most contracts will give you far more than you’ll ever need.Nowadays, data allowance is the biggest commodity. Data is needed to let youbrowse the web, stream video or music and use apps like WhatsApp to send andreceive messages or make video calls. Light users will typically get away with4-10GB of data, but anyone who is a heavy streamer will likely want more.Tethering your data connection is also a great way to make use of any excessminutes. You can turn on the mobile hotspot on your Galaxy S9 and share yourinternet with another device like a tablet or laptop. That’s great if you’reworking on the move.Be sure to compare the higher data tariffs against the lower options, too.Often, you can pay the same price a month and get more data, and there’sreally no reason not to opt for the bigger package if the price is the same.It gets you peace of mind that you won’t run out, and you never know when youmight become engrossed by a new Netflix show that you absolutely must streamwhile on your morning commute.### How to choose the right mobile networkWhen it comes to deciding which network provider to side with, you’re sospoilt for choice that the process can seem rather daunting.
