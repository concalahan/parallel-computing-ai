Instead it was gloriously ambiguous, and said\nthat it would be a “category defining product akin to Pebble Watch, Amazon\nEcho and Snap Spectacles.”\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSnapchat Spectacles, which we’re praying aren’t about to re-emerge with a\nSpotify logo on them\n\nOne source claimed that this hardware would be a wearable , which suggests\nthat it might be closer to a Pebble Watch or Snapchat Spectacles than an\nAmazon Echo.\n\nSimilar job listings also pointed towards working with “major external\nplatform providers within the voice space”, which at least implies voice\ncontrol functionality like the Echo, even if the hardware itself is a wearable\nrather than a speaker.\n\nAlmost a year later in February 2018, a trio of new job adverts suggested that\nthe company’s hardware efforts were nearing release.\n\nThe new listings said the company was looking for an “operations manager”,\n“senior project manager: hardware production”, and “project manager: hardware\nproduction and engineering”. All three made it sound as though the product had\nalready been developed, but that the new challenge was getting it\nmanufactured, marketed and sold.\n\n## Adverts start appearing for a car player\n\nIt’s not clear whether this is a different piece of hardware or the same, but\nback in February a group of Spotify users posted on Reddit to say that Spotify\nwas advertising a new Spotify Car Player to them.\n\nUsers saw the advert alongside a price tag of $12.99 a month, which appeared\nto include a small plastic puck complete with 4G LTE connectivity.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nA car player would make a certain amount of sense for Spotify. We listen to a\nlot of music in our cars, but in-car entertainment seriously lags behind\nwhat’s available on even budget smartphones.\n\nAs it stands, you’re lucky to even get Bluetooth connectivity, let alone a\nsystem that can run Spotify’s software natively.\n\nOur prediction is that this product is intended to be a cheap and cheerful way\nto make it easier to listen to Spotify in your car, potentially opening up a\nlarge new segment of the market to the music streaming service.\n\nThat said, since it’s not a wearable we still think Spotify could have one or\ntwo other pieces of hardware in the works, which may be announced separately\nor alongside the car player.\n\n## Spotify tests voice search\n\nThe final piece of the Spotify hardware puzzle is voice search. We’ve known\nthat the company is interested in voice since its original 2017 job listings,\nbut back in March 2018 the company started [testing its own voice\nsearch](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/spotify-speaker-release-date-\nprice-specs-news-rumours-3425840) software with small amounts of users.\n\nNaturally, Spotify continues to work with existing voice assistants like Alexa\nand Google Assistant, but having its own voice assistant could allow for more\nnuanced control such as saving items, or tapping directly into your daily\nmixes.\n\nThese voice search tests were done through the traditional Spotify app, but\nthe software could just as easily be applied to a future wearable or car\nplayer.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSpotify’s upcoming event is expected to answer many of our questions\n\n## So what does it all mean?\n\nSpotify has been involved with hardware before, but it’s always been content\nto let others develop the physical devices it then integrates with via its\nSpotify Connect wireless connectivity.\n\nLikewise, the company has also played a part in the success of voice\nassistants Alexa and Google Assistant by allowing its service to be so readily\nintegrated. Apple remains the only company to not want to integrate Spotify\nwith its Siri voice assistant, presumably out of a desire to give its own\nApple Music service an advantage.\n\nGetting involved in hardware and software so directly would be a bold step for\nthe company, and you have to wonder whether its recent public listing on the\nNew York Stock Exchange has something to do with the timing of its upcoming\nannouncement.\n\nPotentially, Spotify could be looking at these developments in order to one\nday move away from being reliant on third-party companies, but we think it’s\nmore likely that the company wants its own hardware and services as a backup,\nin case the likes of Google or Amazon start prioritising their own music\nservices within their voice assistants or hardware.\n\nSpotify is unlikely to disappear from your Amazon Echo or Apple Watch anytime\nsoon, but the music service is going to try pretty hard to get you to take a\nhard look at its own hardware in an attempt to cut a bigger slice of the pie\nfor itself.\n\n**What do you think Spotify is working on?
