Where there’s a contrast, the fall of shadows in the game actually\ntells you part of the story,” Oehme explained. “Your first impression of a new\nspace is told by the lighting.”![shadow of the tomb\nraider](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nOehme believes this extra detail will help players get to grips with the\nthemes of the game from the earliest steps approaching the very first vista.\n“There’s a lot of gradients and details in those scenes that tell a story,” he\nsays. “I know this sounds a little out there, but they speak to the player\nwith a visual language. They highlight this balance of harshness and softness.\nThat’s kind of where the ray tracing comes in; the way it lets you blend\nshadows together and mix illuminations together. It creates just that subtle\npush of realism, which is part of the narrative, in a way.”\n\n**Related:**[ **GeForce RTX\n2080**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/nvidia-geforce-rtx-2080-specs-\nprice-2952823)\n\nRay-tracing is a high-profile new part of Nvidia’s upcoming RTX Turing\ngraphics cards and makes a huge difference in the way light is rendered. Ray-\ntracing moves away from crude approximations of how light falls and renders\neach ray of light in real time. The result, as the demo from Nvidia below\nshows, can be pretty impressive.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nAnd that’s key to a game like Shadow of the Tomb Raider. “The world expresses\nthe contrast through light and dark, loneliness and social areas,” Oehme\nexplains. “We explore cold, claustrophobia as well as light, warmth and\nopenness.”\n\nOf course, even the best technology is just another weapon in the armoury of a\ngood storyteller, and Jill Murray, the game’s lead writer, had a more muted\ntake on technology’s storytelling influence. “We should be able to tell the\nstory with stick figures,” Murray says. “If I can make somebody cry doing\nthat, then I’ve been successful.”\n\n_Additional reporting by Will Freeman_\n\n**Will ray-tracing bring gaming stories to life?
