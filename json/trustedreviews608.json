It\nclosely resembles last year’s [iPhone\nX](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-x), while its bigger brother,\nthe [iPhone XS Max](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xs-max),\noffers a much larger display with the same design. Finally there’s the iPhone\nXR: this has a cheaper (£749/$749) price and loses some of the more premium XS\nfeatures like the OLED screen.\n\nIt’s a very iterative update for Apple, but that’s hardly a surprise\nconsidering how much of a jump the iPhone X was. Is this phone good enough to\nforce people against picking up an Android device like the [Samsung Galaxy\nS9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9), [OnePlus\n6T](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/oneplus-6t) or [Google Pixel\n3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-3)?\n\n**Related:[iPhone Black Friday\ndeals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/iphone-black-friday-\ndeals-3597079)**\n\n## iPhone XS – Design\n\nIf you’ve seen the iPhone X then the iPhone XS steps in as a dead ringer. Last\nyear the X showcased a bold new design compared to iPhones of old. Gone was\nthe aluminium frame of its predecessors, replaced with a polished stainless\nsteel alternative. The screen now reached the fringes of the phone’s front and\na glass back facilitated the phone’s new wireless charging feature.\n\n![iPhone XS 3/4 view on\nwood](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAll of this fresh design DNA has been spliced onto the iPhone XS and I’m a\nfan, just as I was with last year’s phone. Some might have complained that the\npolished steel and glass form could have been made less slippery between\ngenerations but this is an issue I only really pin on this year’s larger\niPhone XS Max.\n\nThe XS looks undeniably premium, sits comfortably in the hand thanks to the\npillowed glass and rounded metal frame, and can still be considered one of the\nbest-looking smartphones out there.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nIt’s fractionally heavier than its predecessor and just as with every glass-\nbacked handset, holds onto fingerprints like nobody’s business, but this\ndidn’t come as a shock to me and will only bother those who don’t plan on\nsticking it in a case.\n\n![iPhone XS hardware controls\ncloseup](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Related:[Best iPhone XS cases](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/best-\niphone-xs-cases-3581765)**\n\nIf you do plan on rocking the phone naked, firstly, you’re a braver soul than\nI, and secondly you’ll appreciate the option of the new gold colour, which\nextends to the iPhone XS Max too. Alongside the existing silver and Space Grey\noptions from last year this new finish sports a shiny gold frame and a flat\ncoloured back that I’d say is closer to a ‘warm peach’ than actual gold. It’s\nnot to my taste but I can certainly see it being popular.\n\nA small but nonetheless important upgrade is the iPhone XS’s\nIP68-certification (up from IP67 on last year’s iPhones). This means better\nprotection against dust ingress and the phone is now happy in up to two metres\nof water for up to 30 minutes without springing a leak. Such an enhancement\nbrings it in line with big rivals like the [Samsung Galaxy\nS9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9) and [Sony Xperia\nXZ3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sony-xperia-xz3) and should\nprovide more peace of mind to prospective owners too.\n\n![iPhone XS 3/4 view Lightning\nport](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe headphone jack has been absent from iPhones for a few years now but\npreviously Apple has at least had the courtesy to include a Lightning-to-3.5mm\nadapter in-box. With the iPhone XS, that trend stops.\n\nNow, if you want to add a physical headphone jack onto this thing, you’ll have\nto pay Apple an extra £/$9 for the privilege; or find a cheaper (but\nimportantly, supported) alternative elsewhere.\n\nI hate the dongle nightmare that Apple tends to force on its customers and I’m\nlucky enough to own a pair of wireless\n[Airpods](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/airpods), but for those who\nwant to keep it wired, having to pay even more on top of this phone’s already\nsteep price tag for something as trivial as a headphone jack is a low blow.\n\n## iPhone XS – Screen\n\nThe iPhone XS sports a stunning display, practically unchanged from the one on\nlast year’s top iPhone, and that’s no bad thing. It almost reaches to the edge\nof the phone’s front, packs rounded corners and a notch.\n\nA rarity when the iPhone X launched, the notch was one of the handset’s\nbiggest talking points and it unapologetically makes a return here. Almost as\nwide as the screen itself, the notch plays host to Apple’s own TrueDepth\nsensor technology, along with the phone’s front-facing camera.\n\n![iPhone XS\nMemoji](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nWith so many alternatives now sporting a notch of their own, its appearance on\nthe iPhone XS seems far less jarring than it was a year ago and while Apple’s\nnotch is still one of the biggest out there, I’m far more comfortable with its\npresence than I was on the iPhone X.\n\nIt also serves a dual purpose, offering (fractionally) faster Face ID face\nunlocking than last year’s phone, and a means of tracking your facial\nexpressions when using [Animoji](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-x-\nanimoji-3335178) and the new Memoji feature built into iOS 12. This lets you\ncreate your own visage in Animoji’s same cartoony 3D style to insert into\nmessages or overlay onto your own face in recordings. Fun? Undoubtedly, but\nthe feature will only hold your interest for so long, like a [Nintendo\nWii](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nintendo-wii) or fidget spinners.\n\nAs for the panel of pixels beneath the notch, it’s a thing of real beauty –\nquite possibly the best smartphone screen out there right now.\n\nDubbed a ‘Super Retina Display’, the iPhone XS’s OLED panel is seemingly\nunaltered from the one found on last year’s phone. You again have an 1125 x\n2436 resolution, 19.5:9 aspect ratio display that boasts up to 625 nits\n(according to Apple) of brightness and therefore competently supports both\nHDR10 and [Dolby Vision](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/dolby-vision-hdr-\nguide-3168479) [HDR](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/hdr-tv-high-\ndynamic-television-explained-2927035) standards, as well as the full DCI-P3\nwide colour space.\n\n![iPhone XS screen\ncloseup](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nOn paper, the 458ppi pixel density is below that of its Android flagship\nrivals but in real-world use, you’ll forgive this one shortcoming as content\nstill looks so good. Whether you’re scrolling through Instagram or watching\nhigh dynamic-range content on supported apps like Netflix or YouTube, as I’ve\nalready said, this is one of the nicest smartphone displays available right\nnow.\n\nIf you want more pixels then most rivals, such as the [LG\nG7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/lg-g7), will bring something to the\ntable and if you want more of the same, the iPhone XS Max features all the\nsame strengths at a larger 6.5-inch size, with an extended Full HD+ resolution\nin tow too.\n\nApple’s TrueTone technology is also on hand to offer automatic colour\ntemperature adjustment and there’s Night Shift to filter out disruptive blue\nlight in the evenings, but unlike most other handsets nowadays, the XS forgoes\nany form of manual colour calibration, so make sure you’re happy with the out-\nof-box look, because that’s pretty much all you’ve got to work with.\n\n## iPhone XS – Performance\n\nHuawei was keen to shout about its new [Kirin 980\nprocessor](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/kirin-980-features-release-\ndate-3548238); the first mobile chipset announced to utilise an impressively\nsmall 7nm manufacturing process, however, Apple is the first company to get a\n7nm chip onto a market-ready device in the form of its new A12 Bionic SoC.\n\nIt’s what powers the iPhone XS, XS Max and the upcoming iPhone XR, and it is\nan absolute beast. Unlike previous years, where ‘plus’ model iPhones have\nbenefitted from additional oomph in the form of more memory, this year both\nthe iPhone XS and XS Max enjoy the same 4GB; meaning performance is near-\nenough equal between the two.\n\n![iPhone XS Antutu benchmark\nscores](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nApple’s official line highlights that the A12 offers a 15% CPU performance\nincrease over last year’s A11 Bionic chip and brings a 50% boost to graphical\nperformance on top of that. There’s also a beefier neural engine for AI-\nrelated tasks (like image post-processing) toting more cores and a few other\nbenefits such as Gigabit-class LTE (think faster web browsing and video\nstreaming).\n\nAs is often the case with new iPhone processors, it’s effectively too early to\nreally reap the benefits of the A12’s extra grunt, at least until developers\ncreate more demanding apps in the coming months. In the meantime, the only\ndiscernible differences over iPhone X and its A11 chip are in mildly reduced\napp-load times and (as mentioned earlier) fractionally faster Face ID\nunlocking.\n\nBenchmarking also confirmed my suspicions that the A12 was a solid performer\nthrough and through, trumping every previous A-series chipset and most of the\nother big players from 2018’s flagship smartphone contingent.\n\n![iPhone XS Geekbench 4 benchmark\nscores](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n![iPhone XS 3D Mark benchmark\nscores](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAnother feature that Apple said it worked to improve in the move from X to XS\nwas the phone’s loudspeaker setup. The iPhone X offered stereo with its\nearpiece working in tandem with the downward-facing loudspeaker, but it was\nessentially just upping the volume, resulting in a louder, tinnier sound.\n\nApple has supposedly balanced things out this time around using a more robust\nspeaker in the earpiece that more closely matches that of the existing\nloudspeaker at the bottom of the phone. I’d argue that the promise of a wider\nsoundstage is markedly less pronounced on the iPhone XS compared to the XS\nMax, but I will concede that the sound out of that earpiece is both clearer\nand richer than it was before when enjoying media and when taking calls, even\nif the difference is only slight.\n\n**Related:[Best iPhone 2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\niphone-3501342)**\n\n## iPhone XS – Software\n\n[iOS 12](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ios-12-features-devices-3385158)\n– the newest iteration of Apple’s mobile operating system – landed just a few\ndays ahead of the iPhone XS hitting store shelves and as such, is the software\nexperience that all of Apple’s latest iPhones run out of the box.\n\n![iPhone XS in\nhand](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nNotifications and how iOS handles them has long been an annoyance for many\niPhone users, myself included. Placing individual notifications in a\nchronological timeline running down the lock screen isn’t ideal, especially\nwhen it skips and jumps between the various apps vying for attention.\n\nWith iOS 12, notifications are now grouped by app and it makes managing them\nso much easier. I found myself taking particular delight in dismissing a stack\nof Instagram notifications in a single go and what’s more, the ability to\nsilence notifications from specific apps directly on the lock screen is\nanother great enhancement.\n\nScreen Time is part of the company’s efforts to improve your ‘digital\nwellbeing’, monitoring how much time and where your attention is spent whilst\nusing your iPhone. At the end of each week, it spits out a report to help you\nidentify any unhealthy usage habits you might have picked up.\n\nI used this feature to lock off social media apps after 6pm each night and\nit’s undoubtedly proven its worth.\n\n![iPhone XS screenshots - Screen\nTime](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nScreen Time shows a weekly breakdown of your usage\n\nWhile I didn’t make use of this feature all that much, [Siri\nShortcuts](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/siri-shortcuts-update-3481072)\n(born out of Apple’s acquisition of automation app Workflow) adds a host of\nfunctionality to the company’s digital assistant. It doesn’t really elevate\nSiri’s overall intelligence, which is still lacking when compared to the likes\nof [Google’s offering](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-home-\nlanguages-3544553), but it’s closer in styling to [Amazon Alexa’s\nSkills](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-skills-amazon-echo-2946222).\n\nAs the list of apps that support Siri Shortcuts grows, the feature will become\nfar more powerful, but right now functionality still feels limited outside of\nApple’s own first-party applications.\n\n![iPhone XS screenshots - Stacked notifications, 3D Touch and Memoji\ncreation](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Related:[Google Assistant vs Amazon\nAlexa](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/google-assistant-vs-\nalexa-3370865)**\n\nBeyond these new features, one key aspect of the iOS experience that still\nneeds work is interaction. Like the notch, I’ve grown accustomed to how to get\naround iOS on iPhones with extended displays, such as the iPhone X and XS, but\nit still feels rather unintuitive.\n\nLong-time users of any iPhone older than the X may wonder why Notifications\nCentre and Control Centre both rely on a top-down swipe to be summoned and I\nhonestly can’t tell you. It’s awkward enough having to stretch your hand to\nthe top of the XS’s extended display when using it one-handed, but then having\nto reach even further to get at a separate feature leaves you with a high\nchance of dropping the thing. The problem is even more pronounced on the\nlarger XS Max.\n\n![iPhone XS screenshots - Home screen, Today View, Control\nCentre](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSwiping Control Centre up from the bottom, either side of the on-screen home\nbar, would have made a lot more sense and made for a more seamless transition\nfor users moving between older and newer iPhones like the XS.\n\nThe rest of the gestures unquestionably take some getting used to but require\nfewer brain gymnastics, and if you’re new to iPhones in general, the Tips app\nis on-hand to educate you on the nuances of the phone’s virtual home bar 3D\nTouch and some of the other interaction quirks I’ve mentioned.\n\nSince it was released the iPhone XS has been updated to iOS 12.1 This update\nintroduces Group FaceTime, Dual SIM support and a load more emojis.\n\n[ Next  \nCamera ](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xs-camera)\n\n"}
