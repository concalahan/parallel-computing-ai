Later that day [Apple confirmed the\nissue](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-homepod-wood-furniture-\ndamage-ring-3394561), citing a reaction between the silicone base and oils\noften used to stain the wood.**\n\nIn its statement, Apple said this was common among speakers with the\nvibration-dampening silicone material on the base. It hasn’t been a phenomenon\nwe’d noticed in our own tests, but it seems Apple was right. Today is has\nemerged HomePod isn’t the only culprit.\n\nAccording to Tom’s Guide reporter Mike Prospero, the [Sonos\nOne](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sonos-one) also leaves white\nmarks, where the speaker’s silicone feet come into contact with the wooden\nsurface.\n\nAfter discovering stains left by HomePod, Prospero found more on the same\ntable, in a slightly different shape. He\n[writes](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/sonos-one-damages-wood,news-26628.html):\n\n> “A closer inspection revealed that the Sonos One speaker, which also has\nsmall silicone feet, had made these marks on my cabinet. Looking around the\ntop of the cabinet, I noticed a bunch of little white marks, all left from the\nSonos Ones as I moved them around. So, they will damage your wood furniture,\ntoo.”\n\nSonos is yet to comment on the report, but we’ve reached out to the company\nfor clarification.\n\n## It’s not unusual…\n\nIn its statement on Wednesday Apple moved to assure users the marks left on\nfurniture will fade over time. Should they endure, Apple rather brazenly\nadvised HomePod owners to refinish their furniture.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nIn a post on its support website Apple says: “It is not unusual for any\nspeaker with a vibration-dampening silicone base to leave mild marks when\nplaced on some wooden surfaces.”\n\n“The marks can be caused by oils diffusing between the silicone base and the\ntable surface, and will often go away after several days when the speaker is\nremoved from the wooden surface.”\n\nAmong early HomePod adopters taking to social media to report the damage, one\nsays the markings were left in less than 20 minutes.\n\n> [#homepod](https://twitter.com/hashtag/homepod?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\nleft rings on my wood furniture in less than 20 minutes of use.

Regardless, the\ncompany doesn’t seem too fussed. After all, people who paid £319/$349 or a\nspeaker won’t care about refinishing their furniture, right?\n\n**Will this stop you buying a HomePod?
