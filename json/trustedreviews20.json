It also has the same Wacom digitized layer to help sensethe pressure when you pop out the S Pen from its little compartment.The display has the same punchy colours and exceptional black levels as theNote 4’s. Get up close though and the slight increase in PPI pixel densitypays off. It looks sharper and you can notice it especially on the home screenwhere app icons look cleaner and clearer.The Note’s Super AMOLED screen is built for watching videos and that’sinevitably where the Note 5 excels. You still get those deep blacks and thebump in PPI and brightness helps things feel all that more vivid. Brightnesshas been cranked up notch, not that things were dull on the Note 4, but it’s anotable improvement.If there’s one criticism it’s that out of the box screen colours look a littleoversaturated. Samsung does still offer screen mode options to turn thingsdown a notch. Opt for the basic mode and it doesn’t feel as bad. But I’mnitpicking here.[ Next  Software, S Pen and Performance](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-5-software-s-pen-and-performance-page-2)"}
