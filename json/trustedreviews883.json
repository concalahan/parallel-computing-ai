Now we think we know what it looks like.\n\nAs pointed out by popular YouTube tech reviewer [Marques\nBrownlee](https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/633092867670544384), Google+ user\n[Inno Yudha](https://plus.google.com/109355231408662657913/posts/4DFvi7W6Vgv)\nhas posted the above (poorly framed and slightly blurry) image of a mysterious\nnew Nexus phone.\n\nActually, it isn’t particularly mysterious at all. In fact, its design squares\nup with a [render video](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/leaked-lg-\nnexus-5-render-suggests-fingerprint-scanner-and-usb-c) that emerged late last\nweek.\n\nThere’s the same rounder, matte, vaguely Lumia-esque rear section; the same\nrear-mounted circular motif (which is presumably a fingerprint sensor); and\nthe same spread-out flash and laser autofocus sensor array.\n\n**SEE ALSO:[Best Android Smartphones\n2015](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-android-phones-1_round-up)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThis render was reportedly based on the detailed factory schematics that are\ngiven to accessory makers ahead of a phone’s launch. Now we appear to have\nseen the real thing.\n\nOther things to expect from the second-generation Nexus 5 is a 5.2in display,\na USB-C port and dual front-facing speakers.\n\nIf previous Nexus smartphone launches are anything to go by, we can expect\nconfirmation of Google’s plans some time in October.\n\nCheck out our smartphone group test video below:\n\n"}
