Other specs include a 3540 mAh battery, Qi wireless charging and\nIP68 water-resistance.\n\n**Related:[Best Smartphones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nsmartphone-3431175)**\n\nIt’s also the first phone in the Xperia line to come with two cameras on the\nback. There’s a monochrome 19-megapixel sensor sitting below a 19-megapixel\ncolour sensor, both of these work together to, hopefully, improve low-light\nphotography. Whether or not it performs better than the Xperia XZ2, which we\nfound slightly disappointing, remains to be seen.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAlong with having a 5.8-inch 4K display, the phone can also shoot video in 4K\nHDR. Again, it remains the only phone on the market that can actually do this.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nWhen it launches, the Xperia XZ2 Premium will run Android 8.0 with Sony’s\nfairly inoffensive skin on top. Thankfully we won’t have to wait too long for\nit to be updated to [Android 9\nPie](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/android-pie), as that has been\nconfirmed for a November roll-out.\n\n**Related:[Best Android phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nandroid-phones-3438996)**\n\nObviously having a 4K screen on a phone is a feature to shout about, but\nwhether it actually makes a difference remains to be seen. At least there’s\nplenty of content that you’ll be able to watch on it. Both Amazon Prime Video\nand YouTube support 4K HDR content here, while Netflix will display in HDR\nwith 4K support coming later.\n\nWhen it becomes available on August 31, the Sony Xperia XZ2 Premium will cost\n£799. That puts it right in line with competitors like the [Samsung Galaxy\nS9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9) and [iPhone\n8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-8). It’ll be sold through\nAmazon, along with EE.\n\n**Do you want a phone with a 4K display? Let us know @TrustedReviews**\n\n"}
