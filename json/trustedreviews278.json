I think from that point going forward you’ll see more\nand more prevalence of these types of services, but I would imagine that a\nconsumer’s first experience with autonomous vehicles would be as part of a\nride service, for instance.”\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThat sounds like bad news for taxi drivers, but Butler says Ford is embracing\na future where self-driving cars replace cabbies.\n\n“The way that we look at the situation is: change is coming,” explains Butler.\n“And we can, from a Ford standpoint, hide in a corner and just hope it doesn’t\nhappen, or we can recognise that it’s happening, embrace it, and understand\nhow are we going to continue to deliver for our customers, whether they own\nour vehicles, or whether they use our vehicles.”\n\n![ford](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)A Ford car with sensor technology at CES 2016\n\nHe adds: “Change is coming, we’re at an inflection point in our industry, and\nfrom a Ford standpoint, we choose to embrace it.”\n\nButler describes the risk-reduction that self-driving cars offer compared to\nconventional driving, saying he’s hoping for a “future that is safer”.\n\nHowever, he says he doesn’t “really foresee a day” where actual driving will\nbe outlawed to make way for an autonomous-only system.\n\n“I could be wrong. But I just think in terms of mobility and freedom and\npeople’s ability to move,” the Ford lead tells us. “I think it certainly would\nbe overwhelming to say you must now only be driven, you can never drive\nyourself.”\n\n(apester:569795558089e8dd05d295f8)\n\n**Related:[Apple Car](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-car-news-\nrumours-driverless-price-release-date-electric)**\n\nHowever, he suggests a system whereby the actual driving of vehicles might\nonly be done in designated areas.\n\n“Do I see a day potentially where driving becomes like horseback riding?\nPotentially so. And might that be done in limited areas? Potentially so,”\nButler tells us. “Might we see a scenario where similar to what’s happening in\na lot of major cities, like London, for instance, we have restrictions on the\ntype of driving that you can do, and where you can drive at particular points\nin the day? Might we see certain zones like that, in terms of autonomous-only?\nPotentially.”\n\nHe continues: “But totally outlawing driving? I really can’t see that\nhappening, but maybe that’s just because I’m a passionate driver myself.”\n\nWhat do you make of Don Butler’s comments? Let us know below.\n\n"}
