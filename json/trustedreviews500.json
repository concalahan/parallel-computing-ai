In\nforthcoming findings, the Advertising Standards Agency is set to announce to\nthe e-commerce giant’s claims are misleading.**\n\n[The Times](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/amazon-misleads-buyers-with-\nnext-day-delivery-pledge-says-watchdog-rzds6pdnk) has seen a copy of the\nreport, following an investigation over Christmas delivery delays on Prime-\nlabelled items. The ASA has not confirmed the findings, but says they will be\npublished soon.\n\nThe report allegedly says (via\n[Guardian](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/amazon-misleads-buyers-with-\nnext-day-delivery-pledge-says-watchdog-rzds6pdnk)): “[A] significant\nproportion of Prime-labelled items were not available for delivery the next\nday … because consumers were likely to understand that, so long as they did\nnot order too late, all Prime items would be available for delivery the next\nday … we concluded that the ad was misleading.”\n\nShould the report be confirmed, it’ll be a major blow to Amazon, which charges\nBrits £7.99 a month for the perk most commonly associated with a Prime\nsubscription. In a statement, Amazon said it was working “relentlessly” to\nmeet promised delivery dates for customers. It blamed the Christmas delays on\nthe extreme weather conditions in the UK last December.\n\n**Related:[Is Amazon Prime worth\nit?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/what-is-amazon-prime-worth-\nit-2952846)**\n\nThe news comes as Amazon UK faces the potential of an additional tax on sales\nin order to safeguard the High Street. Late last week, Chancellor Phillip\nHammond floated the idea of an “Amazon tax” ahead of more permanent measures\nto level the playing field.\n\nHe said: “We want to ensure that the high street remains resilient, and we\nalso make sure that taxation is fair between business doing business the\ntraditional way, and those doing business online. We may have to look at\ntemporary tax measures to rebalance the playing field until we can get\ninternational agreements sorted out.”\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThe news comes as it emerged Amazon had dramatically cut its UK corporation\ntext bill, despite enjoying much healthier profits.\n\n**Have you been screwed over by Amazon’s ‘next-day’ claims in the past?
