The chip puts Intel’s latest Core i7\nprocessors with AMD’s Vega M graphics tech. HP claims the new x360 15 with\nIntel Core i7-8705G will be able to smoothly edit and stream 4K and 3D\ncontent.\n\n**Related:[CES 2018 live news and\nhighlights](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ces-2018-live-news-\nhighlights-3350586)**\n\nThere’s also a version of the x360 15 that comes with a quad-core eighth-\ngeneration Intel CPU paired with a dedicated Nvidia GeForce 150 graphics\nprocessor. Either configuration should be more than powerful enough for light\ngaming and design work.\n\nThe new CPU isn’t the only update to the Spectre. The device also features a\nrefreshed angular aluminium chassis and updated 15.6-inch UHD display.\n\nMeasuring in at 19.5mm thick and weighing 2.09kg, the x350 15 remains\nrelatively portable for a machine with these specs.\n\nQuoted battery life is solid as well, with the Core i7-8705G model offering up\nto 12 hours of power on paper. Fast charging tech is also on offer, with HP\nclaiming it will be able to hit 50% battery capacity from just 30 minutes of\ncharge.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nAll in all, the new Spectre x360 15 looks to offer solid workhorse\nperformance, but it won’t be cheap with prices starting from £1499 when the\n2-in-1 launches in February 2018.\n\nHP also took the time to reveal a game streaming service called OMEN Game\nStream. The service can stream games from an OMEN gaming PC to any Windows 10\ndevice.\n\nThe company also showed off the OMEN x 65, a “[big format gaming\ndisplay](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/nvidia-4k-hdr-big-format-gaming-\ndisplays-3367451)” that makes use of Nvidia’s G-Sync tech and offers gamers\nwith plenty of space a 65-inch 4K UHD display that supports the\n[HDR-10](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/hdr-tv-high-dynamic-\ntelevision-explained-2927035) standard.\n\n**Related:[Best laptops](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-laptops)**\n\n**Does the new Spectre x360 15 appeal to you?
