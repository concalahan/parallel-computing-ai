Similar to Apple’s ‘S’ branded, OnePlus’ ‘T’ phones aim to offer a\nrefined experience on their immediate predecessors.\n\nThe OnePlus 6T looks to improve on the already excellent [OnePlus\n6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/oneplus-6) with a larger display,\nsmaller notch, bigger battery and new fingerprint technology. Is it enough to\ntake on [Huawei Mate 20 Pro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/huawei-\nmate-20-pro), [Samsung Galaxy\nS9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9), [iPhone XS\nMax](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xs-max) and [Galaxy Note\n9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-9)?\n\n**Related:[Best Phablets](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nphablet-3500572)**\n\n## OnePlus 6T price\n\n_OnePlus 6T starts at £499/$529 for the 6GB RAM/128GB model, £529/$579 for the\n8GB RAM/128GB version and £579/$629 for 8GB RAM and 256GB._\n\n## OnePlus 6T release date\n\n_OnePlus 6T is available in two colours – Midnight Black and Mirror Black,\nfrom November 6 on  OnePlus.com. In the UK you’ll also be able to buy it from\nO2, EE, Vodafone, Amazon.co.uk, Carphone Warehouse and John Lewis._\n\n## OnePlus 6T – Design\n\nThe OnePlus 6 ushered in a new design direction for the company and its DNA\nruns strong within the 6T. Thanks to a slightly larger display, this phone’s\nfootprint is fractionally bigger and it is a touch heavier but beyond that,\nchanges appear slight.\n\nThe back is a swathe of curved glass 3D glass that sits comfortably against\nyour palm. At launch the two colours: Midnight Black and Mirror Black, sport\ntwo distinctly different finishes. In my opinion, the Midnight Black model I\ntested is the better looking of the two, with a distinctive S-shaped\nreflection appearing across its back when the light hits it that has an almost\nopalescent quality.\n\n  * \n\n![OnePlus 6T handheld S pattern Midnight\nBlack](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIt’s a nice effect and repels fingerprints better than most glass-bodied\nphones, but it also lacks grip as a result. The opposite is true of the Mirror\nBlack version, which offers an inky black reflective finish that looks great\nuntil you touch it, after which fingerprints, smudges and smears run rampant.\n\nOnePlus originally launched phones with more unorthodox material choices like\nbamboo and a roughly-textured polycarbonate called ‘Sandstone’. Now, such\nfinishes have been relegated to OnePlus’ official cases but it’s a nice nod to\nthe brand’s first devices.\n\nThe company’s signature physical alert switcher is an ever-appreciated\ninclusion that lets you toggle between silent, priority and loud, as well as\nletting you check what state your phone is in without having to wake it up –\nit’s immensely satisfying to use. There’s USB-C at the base, as the company\nhas offered for a while now, but for the first time, it’s decided to nix the\nconventional 3.5mm headphone jack.\n\nWhile this seems to be the way things are going and OnePlus is decidedly on-\ntrend for making such a move, there doesn’t appear to be any logic behind it.\nThe only reasons I can think of as to why OnePlus would _have_ to remove it\nwould be to accommodate the large new battery or the additional fingerprint\nsensor components, but that’s pure guesswork.\n\nThankfully, unlike the [iPhone\nXS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xs) unboxing experience,\nyou’ll find a headphone jack adapter in-box that is, of course, coloured in\nthe brand’s signature white-on-red livery.\n\n## OnePlus 6T – Screen\n\nThe 6T packs the biggest display OnePlus has ever put on a phone. At\n6.41-inches it’s sure to satisfy media-lovers, mobile photographers and\ngamers. The extended Full HD resolution renders everything with perfect\nsharpness and colours only really suffer from distortion at the most unusual\nof angles.\n\n![OnePlus 6T head\non](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAs with its predecessor, the 6T supports the full DCI-P3 wide colour gamut and\nthe company’s thrown in options for a variety other colour spaces too, such as\nsRGB, as well as a warm night and monochrome reading mode feature. The use of\nan AMOLED panel is appreciated too, ensuring great contrast and deep blacks,\nwhich again helps when enjoying video.\n\nWe’re yet to see HDR support on a OnePlus device and I wonder whether it has\nanything to do with the brightness output of the displays the company uses.\nWhile I didn’t have any real issues using the OnePlus 6T in bright\nenvironments, other phones definitely go brighter. What’s more, with adaptive\nbrightness enabled, the phone would regularly set the screen too dim based on\nthe surrounding light. Assuming this issue isn’t localised to my experience,\nOnePlus can easily rectify this with a software update. HDR support meanwhile,\nwill likely have to wait for a future device.\n\n![OnePlus 6T notch\ncloseup](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe OnePlus 6 was our first taste of a notched screen from the company, with\nthe 6T, the notch is less-intrusive and far more aesthetically pleasing.\nSimilarly to the Oppo F9 or the ‘dewdrop’ notch found on the [Huawei Mate\n20](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/huawei-mate-20-vs-huawei-\nmate-20-pro-3605805), the top bezel of the phone features a small rounded\ndivot that neatly conceals its 16-megapixel front-facing camera and earpiece.\n\nThe 6T does support face unlock but this is solely achieved using that single\nRGB camera and thus far less secure than the IR dot projection method used by\nthe likes of [Apple’s Face ID](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/face-\nid-3286453). Thankfully, while you still have the option of face unlock,\nyou’re not limited to it.\n\nIn a play that keeps the 6T as part of the cutting-edge smartphone crowd, the\nphone also integrates an in-display fingerprint sensor. A stylised fingerprint\nicon appears on the lock screen when you lift the phone up and after a firm\npress, the phone unlocks as you’d expect.\n\n![OnePlus 6T fingerprint\nsensor](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe feature sounds cool, but it isn’t perfect and I put that down to the\ninfancy of the technology on offer rather than any failing on OnePlus’ part.\nThe previous phone’s rear-mounted solution was undoubtedly faster but it added\nseams to the design and it would seem that OnePlus considered that a problem,\nor simply antiquated.\n\nThe new concealed ultrasonic sensor is definitely a touch less reliable than\nits predecessor, but it feels very cool to use. Right now you can customise\nthe animation that goes along with the unlocking process and OnePlus has\nalluded to implementing a special shortcuts menu, accessed by continuing to\nhold your thumb on the screen as you unlock the 6T – a feature that’s yet to\nbe implemented but I hope gets pushed to the phone soon.\n\n**Related:[Best Android Phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nandroid-phones-3438996)**\n\n## OnePlus 6T – Performance\n\nThe ‘T’ series phones, like Google’s Pixel phones, come at an awkward time if\nyou’re after the latest and greatest mobile processor on the market. The\nQualcomm Snapdragon 845 chipset at the heart of the OnePlus 6T is an\nundeniable powerhouse, that’s featured in nearly every 2018 flagship Android\nphone but it’s about to be supplanted.\n\nWith Qualcomm’s upcoming Tech Summit scheduled for early December we’ll likely\nget eyes on the 845’s replacement, with phones sporting this new flagship chip\nby Easter 2019. That’s still a few months away but just knowing it’s on the\ncards sours the use of an 845 ever so slightly.\n\nBack in the moment, the OnePlus 6T is anything but a weakling. The phone\nperformed excellently during our competitive benchmarking tests.\n\n![OnePlus 6T Geekbench 4 benchmarking\ncomparison](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAll results achieved using a OnePlus 6T with 8GB of RAM\n\n![OnePlus 6T Antutu benchmarking\ncomparison](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n![OnePlus 6T 3D Mark benchmarking\ncomparison](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nWith real-world use that means faultless fluid performance. Whether you’re\nswiping around, streaming video, multitasking or gaming the OnePlus 6T is more\nthan powerful enough. Speaking of gaming, OnePlus has augmented gaming\nperformance with its dedicated gaming mode. It’s similar to experiences on\nrival smartphones, not only letting you manage call and notification behaviour\nbut also limiting the background network usage of other apps and optimising\nCPU, GPU and memory performance each time you launch a game.\n\nYou could turn the feature off if you wanted and you have fine-grain control\nover how it behaves but for the most part, it’s best left to do its thing.\n\nAnother fire-and-forget feature adjacent to gaming mode is OnePlus’ new Smart\nBoost functionality. Buried away in the phone’s settings menu (under ‘OnePlus\nLaboratory’) and enabled by default, Smart Boost analyses your usage and\nstarts to proactively reallocate memory resources to help keep the phone\nfeeling fast. It’s again hard to test what it’s like without a feature like\nthis enabled without testing it over a matter of months but I’m glad it’s\nthere out the box.\n\nAs for call quality, the earpiece is a touch on the tinny side which might be\ndown to its new position up against the top-most fringe of the phone’s bezel,\nbut it’s wholly usable and background noise suppression seems decent – with\nrecipients confirming that I was coming through loud and clear, despite\nwalking down the noisy streets of New York.\n\n## OnePlus 6T – Software\n\nOnePlus was among a handful of manufacturers that promised to deliver fast\nAndroid updates and with the OnePlus 6, it certainly delivered. The OnePlus 6T\nruns an enhanced version of that same Android 9.0 Pie experience out the box\nwith OnePlus’ OxygenOS overlay on top.\n\n![OnePlus 6T OxygenOS screenshots 1, 2,\n3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nThanks to the company’s proactive approach you can enjoy features native to\nAndroid Pie out-the-box, such as the new navigation buttons used by the [Pixel\n3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-3), as well as\nOxygenOS-specific features like parallel apps and shortcut gestures.\n\n![OnePlus 6T OxygenOS screenshots 4, 5,\n6](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nThere are some long-standing but meaningful tweaks as part of OxygenOS that\nmake a phone as large as the 6T that much more enjoyable and easy to use. You\ncan customise quick-launch actions – activated by drawing various shapes on\nthe lock screen – letting you jump to the camera, media playback or switch on\nthe flashlight. You can also swipe down anywhere on a home screen to summon\nnotifications – making one-handed use that much more approachable.\n\n![OnePlus 6T OxygenOS screenshots 7, 8,\n9](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nWith most of the new functionality falling to the performance tools I’ve\nalready mentioned, along with a handful of camera tweaks, the base software\nexperience feels markedly the same as Android Pie on the OnePlus 6, but that’s\nno bad thing. The Shelf – one swipe to the left of your default home screen –\nis one of the best ways of handling widgets and quick actions that I’ve seen\non Android, Hidden Space is an easy way to hide apps from prying eyes without\nmaking it too tricky to get back to them yourself and the rich search\nfunctionality of the apps tray works like a charm.\n\nThere’s little more I can say that I want from OnePlus’ take on Android here.\nI’d like a one-handed mode that actually shrinks the entire UI but I think I’m\nin the minority there, and I’m curious to try out the promised fingerprint-\nsensor based shortcuts feature but beyond that, perhaps a few fewer of\nOnePlus’ own apps stepping on Google’s toes wouldn’t hurt.\n\n## OnePlus 6T – Camera\n\nThe camera hardware at play here appears to be identical to that of its\npredecessor, with a dual 16/20-megapixel snapper taking point, rocking a\nrespectably wide _f/_ 1.7 aperture and PDAF (phase detection autofocus), along\nwith OIS (optical image stabilisation) and enlarged 1.22µm pixels on that main\n16-megapixel sensor. There’s also a 16-megapixel front-facer which leverages\nEIS (electronic image stabilisation). It’s a promising hardware setup, albeit\none we’ve all seen before, begging the question, what’s new?\n\n![OnePlus 6T camera\ncloseup](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nOnePlus has placed a focus on improving the HDR and low-light shooting\ncapabilities of its new device’s snappers, while also adding in a handful of\nextra settings to play with. One nice addition is Auto Nightscape Detection,\nwhich automates the phone’s more advanced low-light photography mode when it\ndetects that ambient light is hard to come by.\n\nThe promise of “industry-leading HDR shots” is one bold claim and naturally, I\nplaced the 6T up against a handful of other top snappers to see just how good\nit really was.\n\n![OnePlus 6T HDR comparison\nsample](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAt 100% crop, the 6T was one of the best for preserving detail throughout the\nscene.\n\n![Huawei P20 Pro OnePlus 6T HDR comparison\nsample](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe Huawei P20 Pro’s HDR was the most aggressive, it also has to be accessed\nas a separate mode, unlike on the 6T.\n\n![iPhone XS OnePlus 6T comparison\nsample](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe iPhone XS lacked detail in the distance and miscoloured the image quite\nheavily compared to the rest of the group.\n\n![Pixel 3 OnePlus 6T comparison\nsample](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe Pixel 3 suffered from the weakest detail and harshest contrast of the\nbunch but still created a pleasing, natural-looking shot overall.\n\n![OnePlus 6 OnePlus 6T comparison\nsample](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nBased on this OnePlus 6 sample, it’s hard to see what tweaks OnePlus has\nreally made to HDR on the 6T.\n\nMoving onto Nightscape, it certainly proves it’s worth in the right\nsituations; it brightens up cityscapes without issue but if hard light sources\nare in-frame, such as lamps, it struggles to balance things out, usually\nblowing out the brightest areas.\n\n![OnePlus 6T Night Mode comparison\n1](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nOff and on: Nightscape has its uses but brightened areas often suffer from\napparent noise (above) and bright elements become blown out (below).\n\n![OnePlus 6T Night Mode comparison\n2](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nIn natural light the 6T’s main snapper is undoubtedly capable, with decent\nexposure control, nice macro range, pleasing depth of field and good (although\nnot perfect) edge detection when snapping portraits.\n\n![OnePlus 6T camera sample - natural light auto-\nHDR](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nEven with auto-HDR, the limits of the camera’s dynamic range are clearly being\ntested.\n\n![OnePlus 6T camera sample - macro\n1](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nColour and bokeh are unquestionably pleasing when taking macro shots.\n\n![OnePlus 6T camera sample - macro\n2](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\n![OnePlus 6T camera sample - natural light auto-HDR\n2](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nDetails break down a little too much for my liking when cropping in but it\nwholly depends on the shot.\n\n![OnePlus 6T camera sample - Portrait\nMode](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe front camera takes nice shots overall and offers balanced beauty controls\nbut colours seem a little off here.\n\nAs for video, you can shoot up to 4K resolution at 60fps (limited to five\nminutes when using these settings) and the results aren’t half bad. It isn’t\ngoing to give the [iPhone XS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-\nxs) cause for concern, partly because of the tinny audio but partly because\nthe image stability could also be improved too. Beyond that footage is\npleasing and the option of slow-motion recording at up to 480fps (at 720p) is\na feature unique to OnePlus.\n\n## OnePlus 6T – Battery Life\n\nThe OnePlus 6T’s 3700mAh power pack doesn’t quite top the 4000mAh behemoth\nfound in the [Huawei P20\nPro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/huawei-p20-pro) or the even more\ncapacious 4200mAh offering used by its new sibling, the [Mate 20\nPro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/huawei-mate-20-pro), but it’s\nstill a winner based on my experiences. It’s clearly equipped to handle a day\nand a half of frequent use and I imagine that for many it’ll stretch to two\ndays between charges without too much trouble.\n\nWith 13 hours away from the wall plug and four hours of screen-on time, my\nOnePlus 6T finished the day at an even 50% charge. In that time I streamed 30\nminutes of Netflix, which sapped 6% of the charge (with the screen brightness\nat half), while a 30 minute stretch of PUBG Mobile, running through multiple\nshort, sharp arcade matches, took 8% out of the battery.\n\nFast Charge (formerly Dash Charge) is a big reason to buy a OnePlus. It’s been\nthe best fast-charging standard out there for a while (although that’s\nstarting to change) and the company has distilled the premise with simple\nelegance into the tagline, “a day’s power in half an hour”. With that claim in\nmind, I was somewhat skeptical this time around.\n\nIncreasing the capacity of the battery without increasing the rate of charge\nmeans that even Fast Charge might not be quick enough to juice up the sizeable\ncell inside the 6T. I was wrong to fret. A 30-minute stint at the wall plug\ntook my OnePlus 6T from 39% to 86% charge (that’s 47%). Sure, it’s not the\nfull 50% that I get through in my general day-to-day but its close enough. I\ncould have switched off mobile data and Wi-Fi while it charged, turned on\nflight mode or switched the phone off altogether if I was desperate for a\nlittle more juice in that same time frame but I didn’t need to.\n\nWhat I would say is that with the combination of OnePlus’ 20W charging tech\nand a battery the size of the 6T’s – the company’s promise has reached its\nlimit. Going forward, if the brand still expects to tout a day’s use from 30\nminutes charge time, it’ll either have to drop the capacity of the battery in\nits next phone or release an improved, even more rapid version of Fast Charge.\n\n## Why buy the OnePlus 6T?\n\nWhile you could say that OnePlus has made some sacrifices in developing the\nOnePlus 6T, they all seem rather subjective. Sure it’s a slightly bigger,\nthicker, heavier phone than the 6 but if that means a bigger battery with\nbetter longevity is it really a loss?\n\nThe headphone jack’s absence is annoying for some but the phone comes with an\nadapter and the in-display fingerprint sensor might not have fit in the same\nfootprint otherwise. The base price has been upped from £469 to £499 but you\nactually get twice the internal storage for less than what you would have paid\nfor the same configuration on the OnePlus 6.\n\nWith all these factors, the OnePlus 6T serves itself up as a worthwhile\nupgrade. If you’re using a [OnePlus\n5](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/oneplus-5) or even a\n[5T](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/oneplus-5t), the 6T is worth\nconsidering.\n\nThe camera still needs a little work to be truly competitive and OnePlus is\nfacing stiffer competition than ever before but these are factors I’m sure the\ncompany is well aware of. So long as that’s the case, we should have good\nthings to look forward to next year.\n\n**Pre-order:[OnePlus 6T from £499 from OnePlus\nStore](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=10937&clickref=tr-\noneplus6t&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Fuk%2F6t%3Ffrom%3Dcarousel)**\n\n## Verdict\n\nThe OnePlus 6T brings new technology and worthwhile improvements to the table\nbut still needs some tweaking.\n\n## Score\n\n  \n\n"}
