Those with helmets can shrug offheadshots while heavily armoured foes aren’t as vulnerable to stealth attacks.There’s a reasonable amount of nuance here, but only if you’re willing to playby the game’s rules. Otherwise, a constant hail of bullets will make mincemeatout of anything **.**Traversal in Shadow of the Tomb Raider is a real accomplishment, even ifcertain segments can be finicky. Climbing jagged mountain sides with your icepicks before precariously grappling downward into a small, tight ravine arejust some of the vertigo-inducing sights you’ll take in.Visually, it’s a masterclass in environmental detail and genuine spectacle. Iplayed on Xbox One X, which is capable of running things at a native 4Kresolution with HDR alongside it. Aside from a few performance hiccups, it ranwithout any issues at all at 30fps. If you’re a sucker for a juicy framerate,there’s an option to prioritise this above resolution to run the game at60fps, and it still looks wonderful.## VerdictShadow of the Tomb Raider is an enjoyable action-adventure for the most part,yet frequently falls victim to a haphazard narrative and structural pacingthat stops the trilogy’s finale from truly standing out.The evolution that was steps away from reaching its crescendo in Rise of theTomb Raider is pushed aside here in favour of an experience that feelsneedlessly disjointed, making the main campaign feel like a distraction fromthe otherwise exceptional side content.Challenge Tombs are a joy to navigate while the ample amounts of relics andtreasures waiting to be found in and around the city of Paititi are a frequentblast to uncover. I’ll be going back for more, and I’m excited to see wherethe series goes next, but I can’t help but feel disappointed when all’s saidand done.## Score"}
