Below you can get all the key details you need to know about\nthe Huawei MediaPad M5 8.4, MediaPad M5 10.8 and MediaPad M5 Pro.**\n\n## What are the Huawei MediaPad M5s?\n\nThe MediaPad M5 is a range of new tablets from Huawei, designed to take on the\n[Samsung Galaxy Book ](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/galaxy-book)and\nApple iPad ranges.\n\nThere are basic 10.8-inch and 8.4-inch versions, plus a top-end 10.8-inch Pro\nvariant which adds support for Huawei’s new M Pen stylus. All of them are\npowered by Huawei’s previous-generation Kirin 960, not its latest 970 and will\nrun on Android Oreo skinned with Huawei’s EMUI software.\n\nYou can see the three tablets full specs in the table below.\n\n**Related:[Best tablets](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-tablets)**\n\n## Huawei MediaPad M5 specs\n\n**Tablet** | **MediaPad M5 8.4** | **MediaPad M5 10.8** | **MediaPad M5 Pro**  \n---|---|---|---  \nScreen | 8.4-inch 2560 x1600 2k, IPS, 359ppi | 10.8-inch, 2560 x1600 2k\nscreen, IPS, 280ppi | 10.8-inch,2560 x1600 2k screen, IPS, 280ppi  \nCPU | Kirin 960 | Kirin 960 | Kirin 960  \nRAM | 4GB  | 4GB | 4GB  \nStorage |  32GB/ 64GB/ 128GB |  32GB/ 64GB/ 128GB | 64GB/128GB1  \nQuoted battery life (capacity not confirmed) | 11 hours 1080p video playback |\n10 hours 1080p video playback | 10 hours 1080p video playback  \nCamera | 8-megapixel front, 13-megapixel rear | 8-megapixel front,\n13-megapixel rear | 8-megapixel front, 13-megapixel rear  \nBattery | 5100 mAh | 7500 mAh | 7500 mAh  \nPorts | USB-C | USB-C | USB-C  \nConnectivity | Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, LTE | Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, LTE | Wi-Fi,\nBluetooth, LTE  \nColours | Gold and grey | Gold and grey | Gold and grey  \nSoftware | Android Oreo with EMUI 8.0 | Android Oreo with EMUI 8.0 | Android\nOreo with EMUI 8.0  \nM Pen Stylus support | No | No | Yes  \n  \n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Spintires: Mudrunners – American Wilds Edition\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/spintires-mudrunners-american-wilds-\nedition \"Spintires: Mudrunners – American Wilds Edition\")\n\n  * [ ![Galaxy Note 10](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Best Phone 2018: 10 best smartphones revealed and rated\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-smartphone-3431175 \"Best Phone\n2018: 10 best smartphones revealed and rated\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Wooting One Keyboard](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Wooting One\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/wooting-one \"Wooting One\")\n\n  * \n\n## Huawei MediaPad M5 first look\n\nHuawei designs are famous for borrowing elements from famous brands, like\nApple and Samsung, and combining them to create something a little different.\nThis remains the case with the MediaPad M5, which definitely takes some\ninspiration from Samsung Galaxy and [Apple iPad\nPro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/ipad-pro-12-9-inch) tablets – but\nthat’s not necessarily a bad thing.\n\nPicking up the Pro and 8.4 MediaPads, the two felt wonderfully premium. Both\nvariants feature an aluminum chassis and 2.5D Gorilla Glass screen. The metal\nused feels a lot like the stellar alloy used in the Apple iPad and, though the\nHuawei rep couldn’t confirm either versions’ exact weight, they were perfectly\ncomfortable to hold.\n\nThe rep’s face of fury when I asked to drop-test them stopped me from checking\ntheir durability properly, but the metal felt like it could survive the odd\naccidental bump and scrape.\n\nThe 8.4-inch version in particular felt wonderfully lightweight and satchel-\nfriendly. Having had an opening play, I can see it being a hit with the\ncurrently underserved small-form-factor Android tablet market. The 2560 x1600\nresolution meant the tablet was wonderfully sharp, and the use of IPS gave it\nsurprisingly wide viewing angles.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nPersonally I’m a little sad about the use of an IPS screen panel. IPS panels\noffer cleaner whites and have higher max brightness levels than competing OLED\nscreens, but they can’t max the contrast ratio, black level or rich colours of\nthe OLED screens seen on competing tablets, such as the Galaxy Book. The\nscreen also doesn’t meet the mobile HDR standard.\n\nThat said, colours on the screen looked great during my demo. Reds and blues\nlooked vibrant, without being oversaturated. They also appeared to be\nnoticeably richer than competing IPS tablet screens I’ve tested. Huawei claims\nthis due to its custom ClariVu enhancement tech, which apparently “offers a\n20% improvement in picture quality” and is a key reason why the MediaPad M5\ncan display “clearer, brighter, crisper colours” than regular IPS screens.\nI’ll need more time with all the tablets to confirm this, but my opening\nimpressions were positive.\n\nCouple this with the 8-inch MediaPad M5’s seriously impressive speakers and I\ncan see it being great for bedroom Netflix viewing and movie binges on long-\nhaul flights. The 8-inch version features Harman Kardon-optimised dual\nspeakers, with a custom virtual surround sound system by Huawei. The 10-inch\nand Pro versions have the same tech, but feature a more robust quad-speaker\nsetup.\n\nPlaying a YouTube video, the speakers were loud enough to drown out the hussle\nand bussle of the demo room and, despite being in less than ideal testing\nconditions, sounded nicely detailed and dynamic.\n\nHuawei promised a dedicated Gaming Mode that optimises the tablet to focus on\ngaming performance. This will further boost the MediaPad’s entertainment\nchops, but I didn’t get a chance to test it during my demo.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe only downside to the 8-inch version’s design is that it doesn’t support\nthe custom keyboard cover Huawei’s selling as an optional extra for the 10 and\nPro variants of the MediaPad M5. The keyboard cover and M Pen Stylus make the\nPro more like a productivity tool than the 8-inch, which seems like the more\nentertainment focused of the two.\n\nThe keyboard connects using a Pogo pin connection. When docked the tablet will\nreportedly launch a “Windows-esque” desktop view with file-management system\nand application window support.\n\nHuawei didn’t have a keyboard cover on hand to test with the Pro, but the pen\nperformed pretty well. The M Pen stylus features 4096 pressure sensitivity\nlevels and, from what I’ve seen, is more than accurate enough for basic\nnotation and photo editing.\n\nDespite running on the older Kirin 960 processor, the tablet didn’t have any\nissues with me editing photos. I’ll be interested to see how it performs with\nmore rigorous, multi-layer digital painting when I get to fully review it.\n\nMy only issue with the MediaPad M5 range stems from its use of EMUI. I’ve\nnever been a fan of the EMUI skin, which makes loads of superfluous changes to\nAndroid’s UI and generally comes with more bloatware and duplicate\napplications than you can shake a stick at.\n\nIt’s also a key reason many Huawei devices only get sporadic updates to newer\nAndroid versions, if at all. The fact that the Huawei rep couldn’t confirm if\nany of the M5 models will be updated to future versions of Android compounded\nmy concerns.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Huawei MediaPad M5 price\n\nHuawei’s only confirmed European pricing for the MediaPad in Europe. You can\nsee the various options below.\n\n**Huawei Mediapad M5 8.4**\n\n  * _4GB+32GB Wi-Fi €349 (roughly £306)_\n  * _4GB+64GB Wi-Fi €399 (roughly £350)_\n  * _4GB+128GB Wi-Fi €449 (roughly £395)_\n\n**Huawei Mediapad M5 10.8**\n\n  * _4GB+32GB Wi-Fi €399 (roughly £350)_\n  * _4GB+64GB Wi-Fi €449 (roughly £395)_\n  * _4GB+128GB Wi-Fi €499 (roughly £438)_\n\n**Huawei Mediapad M5 Pro**\n\n  * _4GB+64GB Wi-Fi €499 (roughly £438)_\n  * _4GB+128GB Wi-Fi €549 (roughly £482)_\n\nThe pricing puts the tablet well below the top end iPad Pro and Galaxy Book,\nwhich both retail for over £600. This could make it a great options for buyers\non a budget looking for an entertainment, or notation tablet.\n\n## Huawei MediaPad M5 release date\n\nThe Media Pad M5 is set to arrive at an unspecified point in Spring.\n\n**Excited about the Huawei MediaPad M5s?
