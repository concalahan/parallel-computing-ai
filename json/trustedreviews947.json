So I can’t talk\nabout this certain area that you’re talking about. But when we start spending\nlarge amounts of money, we’re committed at that point. But we explore things\nwith teams of people.”\n\nCook added that Apple’s explores many things, but ends up releasing very few\nof them.  \n[](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/apple-carplay-vs-android-auto)  \n“Part of exploring technologies and picking the right one is becoming so\nfamiliar with it you can see ways that it can be used. And for us, we’ve never\nbeen about being first.\n\n“So we explore many different things, many different technologies. And at\nfirst we might not know what product it might wind up in.”\n\nWhen quizzed further about whether the hires Apple has made in the last year\nor so constituted spending large amounts of money, Cook again played it with a\nstraight bat.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n“I wouldn’t call it gobs of money,” he added.\n\n**Related:[Android Auto vs Apple\nCarPlay](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/apple-carplay-vs-android-\nauto)**\n\nElsewhere in the Q&A, Cook also commented on fears of an iPhone downturn\nsaying he blocked out the noise from Wall Street naysayers.\n\nHe also said, during these ‘cycles’ Apple doubles down on innovation, while\nother firms retreat.\n\nHe said: “I think, in sort of a bizarre way, cycles can be really great. They\nhave been for Apple because we tend to steadfastly continue to invest in\ninnovation. Some of our greatest innovations and products were born in a\nperiod of challenge.”\n\n(apester:569795558089e8dd05d295f8)\n\nWhat features would you like to see in a Apple car?
