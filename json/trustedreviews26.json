Yes,\nthe concept of into the breach is fairly wargame like, you have to take\nislands and stop these invading bugs from destroying humanity, but because\nit’s a turn-based strategy game it’s a cleverly constructed game of wits to\nmake sure the bugs don’t destroy humanity rather than a shooter.\n\n  * **Read the[Into the Breach review](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/into-the-breach)**\n\n### Gomite Tiltpod £15\n\n[![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)](https://amzn.to/2OVSZmm)\n\nThis gadget is simply brilliant. The Gomite Tiltpod is, as the name suggests,\na tripod for your phone, without the tri. Instead it has a little rubber foot\nto grip the surface and then top section holds your phone and pivots. Not only\ncan it be used for taking photos, it can be positioned for watching videos or\nmaking video chats as well. The most genius thing of all, is that it’s tiny –\nit’s a keyring so it’s easy to take it about everywhere. So it won’t just be a\nseemingly great idea that never gets used as it’s impractical, but it can\neasily come along everywhere your phone does.\n\n  * **Read the[Gomite Tiltpod review](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/gomite-tiltpod)**\n  * [**Buy a Gomite Tiltpod from Amazon**](https://amzn.to/2OVSZmm)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n## Gifts under £50 for her\n\n### [Amazon Fire Stick £40](https://amzn.to/2CO3ErJ)\n\n[![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)](https://amzn.to/2CO3ErJ)\n\nEveryone knows the best TV is on at Christmas, right?

Life is Strange 2: Episode One Roads is\nlike a coming of age drama of a 16-year-old boy, just told through the medium\nof a game rather than a more traditional book or film setting.\n\nAfter a traumatic preclude the game throws you in as an accidental fugitive\nand you begin your journey of life on the run in the American wilderness. It’s\nan updated RPG, for those who want a more substantiated modern storyline with\nmore substance than finding sorcerers to kill dragons.
