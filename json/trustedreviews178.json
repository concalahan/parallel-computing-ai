In an effort to improve the security of its users, Epic\nGames is offering a free emote to every player that turns on two-factor\nauthentication, which is win-win as far as we’re concerned.**\n\nTwo factor authentication most commonly takes the form of a six-digit code\nwhich is emailed or texted to you when you want to log into an online account.\nIt essentially means that only someone with access to your phone on email can\nsign into your account; just having your username and password isn’t enough.\n\n**Related:[Internet security\nguide](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/internet-security-privacy-\nguide-3465790)**\n\n2FA works. Earlier this year Google reported that it made it compulsory for\nevery one of its 85,000 employees and has seen incidents of successful\nphishing attacks [reduced to near\nzero](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/07/google-security-keys-neutralized-\nemployee-phishing/).\n\nSo enabling it was already a no-brainer if you want to keep your Epic Games\naccount secure from hackers, and now you get a free emote as an extra bonus.\n\n## How to enable two-factor authentication in Fortnite\n\nIf you want to get the charming emote, then it’s a fairly simple process to\nenable two-factor authentication on your account.\n\n  1. Epic Games accounts support two different kinds of two-factor authentication; authenticator apps and emails. We’re going to use an authenticator app because it’s more secure than email, and will also work if you don’t have an active internet connection.\n  2. First, download the authenticator app from your relevant app store. We like Duo, but Google Authenticator is also a great option.\n  3. With the app downloaded, head to the [‘Password & Security’ tab](http://epicgames.com/2FA) of your Epic Games account.\n  4. Scroll down to the ‘Two-Factor Authentication’ section, and click ‘Enable Authenticator App’.\n  5. You’ll be shown a QR code on the screen. Open up your authenticator app on your phone and click the plus symbol to add a new account. This will open up your phone’s camera, which you can then use to scan the QR code on your computer screen.\n  6. Now, enter the six-digit code that your app generates onto your online account on your computer.\n  7. That’s it! You’ve now enabled 2FA on your Epic Games account, and you can now enjoy your free emote.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nNow that you’ve got an authenticator app installed on your phone, why not\nsecure your other most important accounts such as Google, Facebook, Twitter\nand Amazon?
