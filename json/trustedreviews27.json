"![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Ahead of the first commercial handset release, the[Snapdragon\n810](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/snapdragon-810-features)\nbenchmark results are in and Qualcomm’s latest System on Chip (SoC) offering\nis a beast.  \n**  \nHaving been marred by reports of long-standing delays and overheating concerns\nin recent weeks – [claims the company has vehemently\nrefuted](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/qualcomm-rubbishes-\nsnapdragon-810-overheating-concerns) – the 1.56GHz, 64-bit octa-core\nSnapdragon 810 is now making its way to handsets, and you won’t be left\nwanting for power.\n\nAccording to our tests, the high profile, high performance Snapdragon 805\nfollow-on should even offer just a little more grunt than the Exynos chip\nexpected to power the upcoming [Samsung Galaxy\nS6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-s6-review).\n\nBenchmarks are, of course, only an indication of the performance on an actual\nphone or tablet, but these tests provide a flavour of what to expect.\n\nPutting the Snapdragon 810 through its paces on a 2K display-packing, Android\n5.0.2, test unit, the chipset recorded a record-breaking score of 61,499 on\nthe popular AnTuTu test suite.\n\nAccording to [leaks earlier this\nweek](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s6-edge-benchmark-\nreveals-record-performance), Samsung’s own Exynos 7420 chip – which the Korean\nmanufacturer has reportedly ditched Qualcomm in favour of – recorded a score\nof 60,978 across the same test criteria.\n\nAlthough the gap to the Exynos chip is marginal, the gulf between the 810’s\nperformance capabilities and those of the preceding 805 and 801 chips is huge.\n\nWhere the 805 powered Samsung Galaxy Note 4 scored 49,136 through AnTuTu’s\nbenchmark tests, the 801 running Sony Xperia Z3 recorded a mark of ‘just’\n42,334.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in

[iPhone\n6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/iphone-6-review) and [iPhone 6\nPlus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/iphone-6-plus-review), a chip which\nscored 46,940.\n\nWhile Samsung has yet to confirm plans to go out on its own with the S6’s CPU,\na number of reports have pointed in this direction.\n\nQualcomm itself has even admitted that a ‘major customer’ has dropped its\nchips for its next flagship phone.\n\n**Related:** What you need to know about the [iPhone\n6S](https://www.trustedreviews.com/iphone-6-review)\n\nA chip expected to feature on many upcoming handsets, the Snapdragon 810
