We had expected to see a refreshed\nversion of the AirPods, but that didn’t happen.\n\nSo we don’t know much about the AirPods 2 so far, but based on the popularity\nand ubiquity of the original AirPods, Apple is certain to issue a refreshed\ndesign. Here’s everything we do know, or think we know, based on leaks and\nrumours.\n\n## Apple Airpods 2 – Release date\n\nRumours abound that the new AirPod could go on sale before the end of 2018. If\nthat date isn’t met, then likely in the first few months of 2019.\n\n## Apple AirPods 2 – Price\n\nThere’s no word yet, but they will probably be not far off the existing\nAirPods price at £159 / $159\n\n**Related:[Apple Black Friday\n2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/apple-black-friday-deals-2942749)**\n\n## Apple AirPods 2 – Design\n\nIt’s likely that the AirPods 2 will have the same look as the current version.\nIt’s proved to be a popular design considering how often you can find an\nAirPod user on public transport. But that doesn’t mean Apple couldn’t make a\nfew changes.\n\nWe imagine this release could come with ear-tips in light of how often the\nAirPods have fallen out (although that’s not the case for everyone).\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG OLED55B8PLA\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/lg-oled55b8pla \"LG OLED55B8PLA\")\n\n  * [ ![Apple store down](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### The Apple Store is down today and that means a new iPad is coming\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-store-down-october-2018-3286349\n\"The Apple Store is down today and that means a new iPad is coming\")\n\n  *   * [ ![apple event october 30](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Apple Event Preview: What to expect at today’s new iPad and Mac launch\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-october-event-2018-3612624 \"Apple\nEvent Preview: What to expect at today’s new iPad and Mac launch\")\n\n  * \n\nLike several of Apple’s other products,the AirPods 2 support wireless\ncharging. The Charging case for the AirPod appears to have undergone a slight\nchange. In an image spotted from the iOS 12 beta, the charging case had a\nsmall LED indicator light on the outside, a useful way of gauging when the\nAirPods have been fully charged.\n\nSiri voice control is also expected to be included. We suspect that in order\nfor this functionality to happen, the AirPods 2 will benefit from an upgraded\nwireless chip, likely to be the W2 chipset.\n\n## Noise cancellation and waterproofing\n\nA new report has suggested that Apple is planning on releasing the next\ngeneration of its true wireless AirPods with noise-cancellation and water\nresistance.\n\nThe report comes [courtesy\nof](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-25/apple-is-said-to-\namplify-its-audio-device-strategy-in-2019) Bloomberg, and claims that the\nearphones will be accompanied by a more traditional pair of over-ear\nheadphones (which will be different from the Beats lineup). They’ll also be\nmore expensive than the current model, potentially leading to a two-tier\nhardware market.\n\nApparently the current plan is to keep the current AirPods on sale, although\nthese will be refreshed at the end of 2018 with hands-free Siri activation.\n\nAlthough water resistance brings to mind swimming, it’s more likely the new\nAirPods will simply be able to survive sweat and a bit of rain. At any rate,\ncurrent Bluetooth technology can’t work underwater.\n\nFollowing on from its use in the[ Apple Watch Series\n4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/apple-watch-4), the new AirPods\ncould add biometric sensing to the earphones to track the user’s heart rate\nduring workouts.\n\n**Related:[AirPods Black Friday](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/airpods-\ndeals-3476762)**\n\n## Apple AirPods 2 – charging case\n\nAs well as reports like these, Apple’s recently-filed patents have given us\nmore clues about the direction it might take its future headphones. One such\npatent suggests the firm is looking at integrating a speaker connection into\nfuture [AirPods](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/airpods) charging\ncases.\n\nThe [patent](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-\nParser?Sect2=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=/netahtml/PTO/search-\nbool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&d=PALL&RefSrch=yes&Query=PN/9949015) details charging\ncase for a wireless listening device such as “a pair of wireless earbuds”,\nwhich is configured to “transmit the media to a non-wireless output device\nconnected to the case”.\n\nFrom the illustration [(H/T](https://www.cultofmac.com/542407/airpod-charging-\ncase-bluetooth-speaker-builtin-apple/) _Cult of Mac_ ) that’s been included\nalongside the patent, it looks as though in practise this will mean that\nyou’ll be able to connect the charging case to an external speaker (ie the\n“non-wireless output device”).\n\nBut why would Apple want to build this functionality into a future charging\ncase? We suspect it might have something to do with the W1 Bluetooth chip\nthat’s behind the rock solid wireless connectivity of the AirPods.\n\n**Related:[Best Wireless Headphones\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-wireless-headphones-bluetooth-\nheadphones)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nApple’s patent illustration, as filed with USPTO\n\nThe case detailed in the patent could allow music to be streamed wirelessly\nusing the high quality W1 chip, and then transmit it to a speaker.\n\nYes, Apple has its own wireless connectivity standard called AirPlay, but\nproviding a means of getting its W1 chip’s connectivity hooked up to speakers\nwould give customers yet more options if they want to play music.\n\nFor now this is just a patent, and so it indicates an area that Apple is\nexploring rather than something they’ve explicitly committed to, but it’s\nanother tantalising piece of information about what kind of product the\nAirPods 2 might end up being.\n\nWe awarded the first-generation\n[AirPods](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/airpods) a very respectable\nseven out of 10, with our main criticism being that they left us wanting more\nin the audio department – they don’t sound too dissimilar to Apple’s £29\nEarPods, in all honesty.\n\n**What feature are you hoping to see on the Apple AirPods 2?
