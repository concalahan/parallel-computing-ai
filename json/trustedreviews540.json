Whether a\ngrinding experience while scouring through deep, winding dungeons, or\nconversing with inhabitants of the world’s countless towns and cities, it all\nadheres to a formula we’ve grown familiar with over the years.\n\nDragon Quest 11: Echoes of an Elusive Age takes pleasure in bringing the\nplayer back to a place that the genre seldom occupies nowadays, and, to my\nsurprise, it shines brightly as a result. It’s a joy to explore Lotozetasia,\nall of which is layered with a touch of nostalgia that spawned a smile with\neach new discovery.\n\nActing as the series’ first single-player venture in 12 years, Square Enix has\nconcocted a vast adventure that excels at almost every level – although some\nof the changes made in this localised release could leave some feeling sour.\n\n**Related:**[ **Best RPGs**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nrpg-3523043)\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nYou play as a young boy growing up in the peaceful town of Cobblestone. Like\nmany RPGs of this ilk, you’re on the verge of adulthood and must participate\nin a trial that will see you progress in life and gain the power to leave your\ndull village.\n\nNothing is as it seems, as a perilous situation sees you revealed as the\n‘Luminary’, a new iteration of an ancient being trusted with saving the world\nfrom unstoppable evils. Upon this discovery you’re provided with some\nequipment, and thrust into the open world with a majestic steed and a few\nprecious resources.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nIt’s an effective yet predictable opening that does an excellent job of\nteaching most of the core mechanics you’ll use throughout the long and\ncompelling journey. If you’ve played an entry in the series, or something\nsimilar such as [Final Fantasy](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/final-\nfantasy-16-release-date-gameplay-news-rumours-trailer-story-3297141) or\n[Persona](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/persona-6-release-date-gameplay-\nnews-story-characters-wishlist-3384625), the acts of progression in DQXI will\nbe immediately familiar.\n\nBattles are turn-based, a whirlwind of basic attacks, unique skills and\nspecial abilities that you’ll unlock both through levelling up and also a\nbespoke upgrade tree for each character. It’s easy to understand, but branches\nout with enough depth after a dozen or so hours that it seldom feels boring.\nIt’s far from unconventional, but as JRPGs go, it’s up there with the best.\n\nYou can choose to approach combat encounters from a fixed camera angle or opt\ninstead to move around freely as select characters within an isolated field.\nApproach the edge during a difficult battle and you’re free to escape,\nalthough the position of yourself and allies doesn’t have an impact on enemy\naccuracy or special buffs, which feels like a missed opportunity.\n\nImagine dodging a deadly attack by swiftly positioning your characters or\nraising your health by stepping into a small puddle on the playing field. It\nsounds incredibly cool, but player movement in Dragon Quest’s battles merely\ngive you something to do, lacking any form of meaningful substance.\n\n**Related:**[ **Upcoming PS4\nGames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/upcoming-ps4-games-3530401)\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nDespite a few small issues, combat is consistently engaging as you earn\nexperience and participate in challenging boss battles. As you meet allies\nthroughout the story, you’ll be able to manually give them commands or entrust\nthem to artificial intelligence with a few select presets.\n\nI combined the two, ensuring I had both attackers and support members on the\nfield at any given time. Speaking of your party, they’re a merry bunch of\nmisfits with a broad range of personalities.\n\nVeronica is a magician who’s been shrunk down to the size of a child, although\nher attitude is one of harsh deliberacy and sassy insults. Sylvando is a\ntravelling performer, who is both absurdly camp and hiding a deep backstory,\nleading to numerous surprises as the narrative moved forward. You’ll bump into\ncountless such characters in Dragon Quest 11, all of whom feel thoughtfully\ndesigned thanks to industry legend Akira Toriyama, who you might know as the\nhand behind Dragon Ball.\n\nSimilar praise can be levelled towards the world you explore in DQXI. It’s\npositively massive, starting out small before providing you the means to\nexplore it without any obstacles in your way. Once again, it’s conventional to\na fault at times, but is presented with such love and care that I found myself\nabsorbed regardless.\n\n**Related:**[ **Kingdom Hearts\n3**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/kingdom-hearts-3-release-date-\ngameplay-2993095)\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nA few things have been thrown into the mix to shake things up, however. The\naforementioned free-moving battle area is a welcome addition, and campfires\nacross the open world can be used to converse with party members and craft new\nequipment.\n\nThe latter is achieved through a fun yet simplistic mini-game, where you must\nhit the sweet spot in gauges to form a weapon or piece of armour to\nperfection. There’s almost no consequence to failure, and resources are\nplentiful that you’re free to try again whenever you like.\n\nThat aside, it’s a fun little distraction that provides an extra layer of\nmeaning than simply buying all your spoils from the local merchants. DQXI\nexcels at this, taking tried-and-true JRPG staples and making them feel fresh\nagain with minimal effort.\n\nDungeon layouts that I’ve seen dozens of times before have been freshened up\nwith new methods of traversal and nifty puzzles that make navigating them an\nunexpected joy – especially when my party members are quick to blurt out silly\nquips the second I ask for their input. Even after 20 hours or so I never\ntired of such things, welcoming every new twist I knew awaited me.\n\n**Related:**[ **Best Nintendo Switch\nGames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/nintendo-switch-games-3435122)\n\n![dragon quest 11\n](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nOne of my only qualms with DQXI concerns the localisation effort, which I grew\nto appreciate the more time I sunk into the game. For the first time ever,\nfully voiced characters have been introduced to the series, shaking up what\nhas until now been a silent, text-driven experience.\n\nFor the English version specifically, this means a range of regional dialects\nhave been brought to the forefront, and now rely on effective performances and\nstellar writing to remain convincing. In past efforts it was trivial, but now\nit can be a little difficult to take seriously with botched line delivery\nbecoming a frequent issue.\n\nIt started off as incredibly irritating, but I quickly grew to the love the\ncampy tone and unusual performances that so many characters bring to the\ntable. Square Enix hasn’t set out to craft a melodramatic fable that we’re\ndestined to take seriously, so falling outside the lines isn’t the end of the\nworld here. However, it will definitely be a matter of taste for most players.\n\nAll of the other changes made in the localisation process are universally\npositive. There’s now an option to sprint through dungeons and the open world,\nmaking it far easier to traverse long distances. You can also unlock extra\ncostumes, and there’s nothing in the world more adorable than Veronica in a\nkitty costume.\n\n**Related:[Strange Brigade\nReview](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/strange-brigade)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Verdict**\n\nDragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age is another fantastic entry in a\nseries that’s become recognised for its high quality in the JRPG genre.\n\nIt doesn’t advance the formula in many meaningful ways, but refines things\nwe’ve come to love while enhancing them with fun and unexpected additions. The\nlocalisation is bound to be a polarising aspect for many, but after a small\nteething period, I found it to be a charming alternative to the original\nvision.\n\nAs far as role-playing adventures on the PS4 are concerned, this is one of the\nbest you can play on the platform right now.\n\n## Score\n\n  \n\n"}
