All the new films and TV shows coming\nin November 2018\n\n**‘Tis the season to comfort-eat, set fire to stuff, and reminisce endlessly\nabout the summer. November is here, bringing with it the joys of inescapable\nsniffles, numb fingers and extremely short days. Great stuff. It’s also time\nfor a whole new batch of TV shows and films to hit Netflix.**\n\nOctober was an excellent month, bringing with it the likes of 22 July, a film\nbased on Anders Breivik’s 2011 terror attacks in Norway, Making a Murderer:\nPart 2, and Chilling Adventures of Sabrina.\n\nNovember’s not quite as exciting, but there’s still lots to look forward to,\nincluding the sixth and final season of House of Cards (November 2), as well\nas… erm… 2 Guns (November 16) and Ali G Indahouse (November 9).\n\n**Related:[Best horror movies on Netflix\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/best-horror-movies-netflix-halloween-\nfilms-3607041)**\n\nHere’s what’s new on Netflix in the UK in November 2018.\n\n**November 1**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n  * Children of Men\n  * Crusoe\n  * Dead Set\n  * The Hooligan Factory\n  * The Tigers of Scotland\n  * Calico Critters: A Town of Dreams\n  * Calico Critters\n  * Calico Critters: The Treasure of Calico Village\n  * Deadly Expose\n  * Edge of Fear\n  * Expatriot\n  * Hang ‘Em High\n  * In a Valley of Violence\n  * Katt Williams: The Pimp Chronicles: Pt. 1\n  * Malone\n  * Our House\n  * RoboCop\n  * Sleepwalker\n  * The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\n  * The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\n  * The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\n  * The Untold Tales of Armistead Maupin\n  * Thunderbolt and Lightfoot\n  * Follow This Part 3\n  * Angela’s Christmas\n\n**November 2**\n\n  * Daybreakers\n  * House Of Cards Season 6\n  * The Holiday Calendar\n  * The Other Side Of The Wind\n  * Re:Mastered: Tricky Dick And The Man In Black\n  * They’ll Love Me When I’m Dead\n  * Brainchild\n  * Trolls: The Beat Goes On Season 4\n\n**November 5**\n\n  * John Leguizamo’s Latin History For Morons\n\n**November 6**\n\n  * The Late Bloomer\n\n**November 8**\n\n  * Neighbors\n\n**November 9**\n\n  * An American Tail\n  * BASEketball\n  * Ali G Indahouse\n  * The Best of Me\n  * The Perfect Man\n  * Waterworld\n  * La Reina Del Flow\n  * Super Drags\n  * The Sinner Season 2\n  * Westside\n  * Outlaw King\n  * Medal Of Honor\n  * Beat Bugs Season 3\n  * Spirit Riding Free Season 7\n  * Treehouse Detectives Season 2\n\n**November 10**\n\n  * Almost Christmas\n  * Limitless\n\n**November 13**\n\n  * Warrior\n  * Loudon Wainwright III: Surviving Twin\n\n**November 15**\n\n  * The Windsors\n  * May The Devil Take You\n  * The Crew\n\n**November 16**\n\n  * 2 Guns\n  * Cam\n  * Narcos: Mexico\n  * The Kominsky Method\n  * Cam\n  * The Princess Switch\n  * The Ballad Of Buster Scruggs\n  * Ponysitters Club Season 2\n  * She-Ra And The Princesses Of Power\n  * Prince Of Peoria\n\n**November 19**\n\n  * The Man Who Knew Infinity\n  * The Last Kingdom Series 3\n\n**November 20**\n\n  * The Final Table\n  * Sabrina\n  * Trevor Noah: Son Of Patricia\n  * Kulipari: Dream Walker\n  * Motown Magic\n\n**November 21**\n\n  * The Tribe\n\n**November 22**\n\n  * Greenleaf Season 3\n  * Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Gauntlet\n  * The Christmas Chronicles\n\n**November 23**\n\n  * The Evolution Of Us\n  * Frontier Season 3\n  * Fugitiva\n\n**November 27**\n\n  * Bumping Mics With Jeff Ross and Dave Attel\n\n**November 29**\n\n  * Soltera Codiciada\n\n**November 30**\n\n  * Death By Magic\n  * 1983\n  * Baby\n  * F Is For Family Season 3\n  * Nicky Jam: El Ganador\n  * Rajma Chawal\n  * A Christmas Prince: The Royal Wedding\n  * Tiempo Compartido\n  * Spy Kids: Mission Critical Season 2\n\n**Related:[Netflix vs Amazon Prime Instant\nVideo](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/netflix-vs-amazon-prime-instant-\nvideo-2918310)**\n\n**Which films and TV shows are you most looking forward to?
