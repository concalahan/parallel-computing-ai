That12-megapixel sensor takes reliably colourful shots with great dynamic rangeand impressive contrast.The bigger difference is with the portrait mode. As the iPhone XR only has onesensor, it lacks the telephoto camera of the XS and as such it can’t createthe same depth map needed to accurately differentiate between the foregroundand the background. Instead, it purely uses software and the results, whilestill good, are a little more rough around the edges.

Unless you really care about the screen (and it’s worth£250/$250 to you) then we’d say plump for the iPhone XR."}
