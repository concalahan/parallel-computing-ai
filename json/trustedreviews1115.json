USB-C is the main charging connection and that sits on thebottom.The colours these phones come in are slightly different too. The Pixel 3 camein white, blue and black, with the Pixel 2 XL getting rid of the blue option.There’s a bit more parity with the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL as they both comeblack, white and a light shade of pink, confusingly named ‘Not Pink’.## **Pixel 3 vs Pixel 2: What’s new with the specs and features?**As you’d expect with a yearly upgrade of a flagship phone, the Pixel 3 andPixel 3 XL improve the chipset used to power the phones.The Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL were both powered by the Snapdragon 835, with thePixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL upping that to the newer Snapdragon 845. The 845 offersimproved speed in both the GPU and CPU, along with support for gigabit LTE.4GB RAM remains the same across all the Pixel phones and it seems odd thatGoogle hasn’t upped that to at least 6GB for the Pixel 3 or Pixel 3 XL.Storage still starts at 64GB too (again with no microSD) with a 128GB optionavailable too.During the announcement for the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL, Google talked up thecamera capabilities of the phones heavily. The 12.2-megapixel _f/_ 1.8 cameraremains similar in terms of specs, however, Google has again worked hard onthe computational side of things and some of the demo images it showed offlooked truly stunning.**Related:[Best Android Phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-android-phones-3438996)**The camera app has been tweaked too and it seems much easier to quickly jumpbetween different modes including new additions Top Shot, Super Res Zoom andNight Sight. Some of these features will then trickle down to the older Pixeldevices too.There are changes on the front camera as well. On the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XLthere was a single 8-megapixel selfie shooter – but now there are two of them.One of them remains your standard, closely-cropped sensor with the other beingwide-angle – called the Group Selfie Cam. Having a wider camera allows you tocram more faces into the photos.The Pixel 3’s battery is marginally larger than the Pixel 2’s while the Pixel3 XL actually packs in a slightly smaller cell than 2017’s XL model.The Pixel 2 had a 5-inch screen, with the Pixel 2 XL upping that to 6-inches.Both new phones announced today have larger screens than their predecessors.The Pixel 3 has a 5.5-inch FHD+ 18:9 display with the Pixel 3 XL boasting a6.3-inch 2960 x 1440 18.5:9 panel. HDR support is here too.## **Pixel 3 vs Pixel 2: Are they more expensive?**Google’s upped the starting price of this year’s Pixels, with the Pixel 3coming in at a far-from-trivial £739/$799 and the 3 XL costing £869/$899, withan additional £100/$100 added onto each if you opt for the larger 128GBstorage capacity.## **Early verdict**The Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL look like good phones, however, they seem to bevery minor updates over the outgoing models. There’s been a bump in specs andsome nice features added – wireless charging being one – but nothing we’dconsider substantial. Of course, that could all change when we properly spendsome time with those shiny new cameras."}
