What such people want is a true successor to 2013’s\n4.95-inch Nexus 5.\n\nAccording to Android Police’s Artem Russakovskii, those people are going to\nget their wish.\n\nRussakovskii has written a [Google+\npost](https://plus.google.com/+ArtemRussakovskii/posts/cf7ZgPNrH4x)\nhighlighting rumours that there will be two Nexus devices launched in 2015.\nThe second one will sport a 5.2-inch display and will be made by LG, the\nmanufacturer behind the Nexus 5.\n\n**Read More:**[ **Best Android phones 2015**  \n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-android-phones-1_round-up)  \nAs the post points out, this would be the first time Google has launched two\nNexus phones in a year. But hey, if Samsung and Apple can do it, why not?\n\nOf course, with a good half of the year to go before we see Google’s plans\ncome to fruition, there’s still plenty of time for a change. After all, this\ntime last year it’s widely held that Google had no intention of launching what\nbecame the Nexus 6.\n\n"}
