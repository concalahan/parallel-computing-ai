The Pixel Stand costs £69 in the\nUK, and it’s available to pre-order right\n[here](https://store.google.com/product/pixel_stand). At the time of\npublication, Google Store says it will start shipping on November 8.\n\nSo what can it do? The Pixel Stand is a wireless charging dock that’s designed\nfor the Pixel 3, but capable of powering up any Qi-compatible device. Google\nsays it outputs up to 10W of power with the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL.\n\nIn terms of design, there’s not a huge amount to really talk about. The Stand\nis very… minimal. It’s white, and features a circular base with a ridge at the\nfront and what looks like a backplate jutting out from middle.\n\nThese are, of course, what you’re supposed to place your phone between, as\nshown below.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n> Pixel Stand wirelessly charges your phone.

From here, it can also turn your handset into a digital\nphoto frame of sorts, showcasing images from Google Photos. Hopefully nothing\nrude though.\n\n**Read more:[Best Android phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nandroid-phones-3438996)**\n\nAlbum covers will appear on-screen if you’re playing music, and if you’re a\nsmart home ninja with a Nest Hello video doorbell, you’ll get a live feed on\nyour Pixel handset’s screen when it’s docked on the Stand.\n\nIt can also display things like your calendar and weather from the Stand, but\nGoogle wants users to predominantly interact with docked phones through Google\nAssistant.\n\nHere are some quick links to learn more about some of the other new products\nannounced at Made by Google.\n\n  * **[Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-pixel-3-release-date-specs-price-3316812) **\n  * **[Pixel Slate](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-pixel-slate-specs-release-date-price-3601351)**\n  * **[Google Home Hub](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-home-hub-uk-release-date-price-3583109)**\n\n**Are you tempted by the Google Pixel Stand?
