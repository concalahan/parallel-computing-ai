That\npositioning should boost the signal for mobile broadband users.\n\nElsewhere, the 2018 iteration is now even thinner than before; down from 10mm\nto 8.98mm. That’s enough to make it the thinnest computer in the world, Acer\nasserts.\n\nThe display, which maintains its 1080p resolution, gains a Gorilla Glass-\ncoated touch surface and, at 14-inches, is now larger than its 13.3-inch\npredecessor.\n\n**Related:[CES 2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ces-2018-news-\nrumours-dates-3350586)**\n\n2018’s Swift maintains the previous-generation Intel Core i7 processor (Kaby\nLake). Why Acer decided to omit the latest 8th-gen chips remains to be seen.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThere’s also 10-hours of battery life; up from the estimated 9-hour cell on\nlast year’s model. The company is also packing in 8GB RAM and a 256GB SSD.\n\nFor all of those improvements, you’ll also pay a much higher premium. It’ll go\non sale in March for a whopping $1,699 (around £1,250).\n\nThat puts it into the same price realm as the Dell XPS 13 and the Lenovo Yoga\n920, which do boast those newer Intel processors and higher resolution\ndisplays.\n\n**Thinner chassis or a better display?
