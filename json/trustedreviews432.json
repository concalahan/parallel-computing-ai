With a 2019 release expected, the biggest question is whether the\nplatform will bring support for[5G](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/what-\nis-5g-vs-4g-2911748). Well now the company’s addressed the issue, and it seems\nthe answer’s a little complicated. **\n\nInitially, there were rumours that the 855, the successor to this year’s\nSnapdragon 845, would not support 5G connectivity. This came from the\ncompany’s Principal Engineer/Manager Ahmed Saifuddin who’s [said\nthat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmed-saifuddin-29a28862/?trk=aff_src.aff-\nlilpar_c.partners_pkw.10078_net.mediapartner_plc.Skimbit%20Ltd._pcrid.449670_learning&veh=aff_src.aff-\nlilpar_c.partners_pkw.10078_net.mediapartner_plc.Skimbit%20Ltd._pcrid.449670_learning&irgwc=1)\nthe 855 SoC will feature a ‘Hercules Modem’ — aka a 7nm X24 LTE modem.\n\nIn other words, this suggested that it wasn’t possible to integrate the\npreviously announced 10nm 5G X50 modem directly onto the Snapdragon 855 SoC.\n\nIt’s this report that Qualcomm’s announcement today is seemingly is response\nto, but the company doesn’t technically deny its claims.\n\nInstead, Qualcomm’s press release says that the “upcoming flagship mobile\nplatform” 7nm SoC (which is almost certainly the Snapdragon 855) “can be\npaired with” the 5G X50 modem.\n\nAlthough the fact that Qualcomm doesn’t refer to the platform by name makes\nthe announcement a little hard to unpack, it sounds as though it will be left\nto phone manufacturers themselves to decide whether they want to pair the\nSnapdragon 855 with a separate compatible 5G modem.\n\n**Related:[Best smartphones 2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nsmartphone-3431175)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n## Growing pains\n\nWith 5G not expected to widely roll out until 2020, next year will be very\nearly to start rolling out devices that support the next generation of mobile\ninternet.\n\nWe’re anticipating that problems like this won’t be uncommon, as manufacturers\nrace to include 5G connectivity in their latest products. It will likely take\na while longer before we see platforms built from the ground up to support 5G.\n\nAt any rate, the usefulness of 5G will be up for debate until we see how wide\ncoverage is across the world. There’s little use paying a big price premium\nfor a device when you can only unlock 5G speeds in very specific locations.\n\n**What do you want to see from Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 855?
