It meant users wouldn’t be able attach\nthe device to more powerful speakers and enjoy improved audio.**\n\nAfter-all, the Amazon Echo has one, giving it a major leg up on the latecomer\nto the party. Why did Google not do likewise?\n\nHowever, one intrepid Google Home Mini user wasn’t about to stand for this and\ndecided to perform a little surgery on the smart speaker.\n\n**Related:[Best smartphone](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nsmartphone)**\n\nTech modder\n[SnekTek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMfcrZYOAnE&feature=youtu.be) has\nadded the missing aux audio port and posted the method to YouTube.\n\nHe had to steam off the adhesive on the bottom of the speaker, before finding\na place for the headphone port, drilling through the case and splitting the\naudio.\n\nYou can see the method in the video below (via [Android\nPolice](http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/12/09/someone-just-gave-google-home-\nmini-headphone-jack-kind/)).\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nThe best thing is, this doesn’t disable the internal speaker, but it does\nenable users to plug it into their best speakers and access all of those\nlovely voice and wireless controls.\n\nAs you can see, it works pretty darn well.\n\nIf you’re not feeling up to this challenge, then a Google Chromecast audio\nwill do the trick and enable you to stream from the Home Mini over Wi-Fi.\n\n## Home Max is here\n\nIn less universal Google Home news, the high-end Max speaker went on sale in\nthe United States on Monday. It can be snapped up today from Best Buy and\nVerizon stores.\n\nThe $399 device beats Apple HomePod to market, with Cupertino’s Siri-powered\neffort now delayed until 2018.\n\nWe still don’t know when Home Max will arrive in the UK, but we’d assume\nGoogle will open up international availability sometime in early 2018.\n\n**Have you snapped up a Google Home / Home Mini?
