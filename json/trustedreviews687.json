This\nis because, while the bevy of iPhones received minor updates, Apple’s wearable\nwas completely redesigned.\n\nWhen the Apple Watch was first released it felt like a complete dud. It was\nslow, lacked focus and, for me, spent more time on the charger than on my\nwrist. The turnaround since that initial release has been tremendous as Apple\nhas spent the last few years removing superfluous features and focusing on\nredesigning the Watch as a fitness aid rather than a notification tool.\n\nWith the Watch Series 4, Apple has crafted its best smartwatch yet.\n\n## **Apple Watch Series 4 – Price**\n\n_Here’s full pricing for the Apple Watch Series 4:_\n\n  * GPS 40mm – from £399/$399\n  * GPS 44mm – from £429/$429\n  * GPS and LTE 40mm – from £499/$499\n  * GPS and LTE 44mm – from £529/$529\n  * GPS and LTE 40mm Stainless Steel – from £699/$699\n  * GPS and LTE 44mm Stainless Steel – from £749/$749\n\n**Related:[Best smartwatch](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nsmartwatch-3434307)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![new mac mini 2018](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n###  New Mac mini 2018: Everything you need to know about the new Mac mini\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/new-mac-mini-2018-release-date-3552537\n\"New Mac mini 2018: Everything you need to know about the new Mac mini\")\n\n  * [ ![Apple Pencil](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### iPad Pro (2018) vs iPad Pro (2017): What’s new?\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ipad-pro-2018-vs-ipad-pro-2017-3612809\n\"iPad Pro \\(2018\\) vs iPad Pro \\(2017\\): What’s new?\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Apple Pencil](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Apple Pencil 2 for iPad Pro 2018 adds wireless charging, magnetic\nconnection and new gestures\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-pencil-2-2018-features-3612981\n\"Apple Pencil 2 for iPad Pro 2018 adds wireless charging, magnetic connection\nand new gestures\")\n\n  * \n\n## **Apple Watch 4 – Design and straps**\n\nThere’s been little change in the design of the Apple Watch since its\nintroduction – until now. The Series 4 is the first real reinvention of the\nwearable. I say reinvention, but if you’re familiar with previous Apple\nWatches then you’ll instantly feel at home with the Apple Watch Series 4.\n\nUnlike the majority of Wear OS wearables, the Apple Watch 4 retains the square\ndisplay, having decided against making it circular. Personally, I prefer this\n– I often find circular smartwatches try too hard to mimic ‘proper’ mechanical\nwatches and end up looking like cheap knock-offs. Then again, by keeping the\nsquared-off look there is still a hint of ‘computer on your wrist’ about the\nApple Watch that some might not like.\n\n![Apple Watch\n4](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nInstead of offering a radical redesign, Apple has tweaked everything that was\nthere before. The screen now stretches almost to the edge of the face,\nreducing the bezel that flows around the sides. Imagine the difference between\nthe [iPhone 8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-8) and [iPhone\nX](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-x), and you’ll understand\nwhat Apple has done here. Pair this updated screen with the steeper, curvier\ncorners and you’ve got a watch that really feels all-screen. I switched back\nto an [Apple Watch Series 3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/apple-\nwatch-3) midway through this review and the difference is really remarkable.\nThe older wearable feels noticeably cramped and old-fashioned in comparison.\n\nThis is also the first Apple Watch to play about with the sizing, replacing\nthe 38mm and 42mm sizes with 40mm and 44mm. I was initially sceptical about\nthe 44mm size (this is one I have been using during the review period) as\nthere were times when I felt the 42mm size was a little on the large side for\nmy wrists, but really the difference is negligible and just leads to bigger\ndisplays.\n\nThe new 40mm version has a screen size comparable to the older 42mm watch, but\nwith a display that’s more akin to the 42mm one. The 44mm, on the other hand,\nis only slightly larger than the 42mm model. If you have larger wrists then\nthe 44mm is the way to go – the larger screen is great for cramming more\ninformation and making it easier to see. However, if your wrists are on the\nsmaller side then you’re not losing _too_ much by plumping for the smaller\nsize.\n\n![Apple Watch 4 vs Watch\n3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nApple Watch 4 (left) & Watch 3 (right)\n\nA subtler design change is that the sensor array that sits on the bottom of\nthe watch has been shrunken down, resulting in a less bulbous look. This means\nthe Apple Watch 4 sits closer to the wrist than before. It’s a small design\ntweak – one you’ll only notice if you’re upgrading from a previous model – yet\nit’s something I have constantly been impressed with.\n\nFlanking the improved screen are the usual selection of buttons: the Digital\nCrown for navigation and a secondary, side button. The Digital Crown now has\nhaptic responses when you twist it, slightly bumping your finger with a subtle\nvibration. As with so many design tweaks here, it seems small at first but the\nresult is terrific. The resistance offered when you’re scrolling through\nmenus, or jumping between options in the Workout app, adds that tangible\nfeeling so often missing from techy watches.\n\nBelow the Digital Crown is the side button that’s been re-appropriated in use\nover the years. It can now either bring up your dock of favourite apps or your\nmost recently used apps. I mainly use it for bringing up [Apple\nPay](https://www.trustedreviews.com/how-to/how-to-use-apple-pay-3520824).\n\nInbetween the Digital Crown and side button is the microphone, while the\nspeaker has been shunted to the other side. This is to try and avoid any\ninterference between the two.\n\n![Apple Watch\n4](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nEven though Apple has altered the sizing, older straps and bands (Apple’s own\nor third-party) will still work just fine. This is massive news and very un-\nApple. I’ve picked up loads of straps both from Apple and from the large\nselection on Amazon over the past few years and it’s nice to know the\ninvestment is still valid.\n\nThroughout the majority of the review I have been switching between the Sport\nLoop and the Sport Strap, with the Leather Loop thrown in for the classier\noccasion. The ease of the Sport Loop, with its velcro band, is my favourite of\nthe bunch – it’s just the easiest and the comfiest. It’s made from a slightly\nelastic fabric and uses a hook and loop fixing, similar to the premium\nMilanese Loop, to secure around your wrist. Since it uses this strap, it’ll\nfit pretty much any sized wrist and allow you to alter the fit depending on\nwhat you’re doing.\n\nAll models of the Apple Watch Series 4 remain water-resistant to 50m and will\nsurvive a dunk in sea water, too. These models use the same water-ejection\nmethod as the Series 2 and Series 3, where it will play a specific tone to\neject water from the speaker.\n\n## **Apple Watch 4 – Screen and speaker**\n\nThe display is real the star of the show here, and for some it might be reason\nenough to upgrade. If you plump for the 44mm model there’s a 368 x 448\ndisplay, with the 40mm packing 324 x 394 pixels. This is the only difference\nbetween the two.\n\nBoth use [OLED](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/oled-vs-led-\nlcd-2924602) display types, offer Force Touch and 1000 nits of brightness.\nOther watches, notably the Fitbit Versa, match this peak brightness and it’s\nvital for ensuring you can comfortably read whatever’s on the watch even if\nyou’re running in intense sunlight. The touchscreen remains incredibly vibrant\nand sharp, whether displaying one of the new Apple Watch 4 exclusive watch\nfaces or your fitness stats for the day. The font is readable and icons are\neasy to see and interact with.\n\nHaving a larger panel means Apple can cram more information into the watch\nfaces it includes. There are two headline faces exclusive to the Series 4 and\nthey both let you add many more complications than were previously available.\nI’ve mainly been sticking with the Infograph option, which allows for an\nimpressive eight complications, but there’s a digital-focused Infograph\nmodular option too.\n\n**Related:[Best smartphones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nsmartphone-3431175)**\n\n![Apple Watch Series\n4](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nInfograph watch face allows for eight complications\n\nHaving so many nuggets of information available at a glance could have been\noverwhelming, however the bright and varied use of colour helps each stand\nout. If you’re a previous Apple Watch user then you’ll notice only updated\ncomplications work with these new faces and even Apple hasn’t altered many of\nits old ones. This means you might be switching back to some of the old ones\nif you’ve got a particular set-up you favour.\n\nIf you really want to show off the new display then there’s the Vapor and\nFire/Water watch faces that highlight the edge-to-edge nature of the panel.\nThe highlight of these is the fire option, which sees a roaring flame explode\nout of the dial. The functionality of these is limited though, as you can’t\nadd any complications without sacrificing the full-screen look.\n\n![Apple Watch Series\n4](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nThe new fire watch face explodes from the dial\n\nI still have a big complaint, though, and it’s the same complaint Richard\nEaston levelled at the Series 3 – why is there no always-on display option so\nI can constantly see the time? This is something just about every other high-\nend smartwatch we’ve reviewed this year has implemented and it’s sorely\nmissing here. I understand this would heavily impact battery life and Apple\nwants to ensure everyone’s watch makes it through the day, but there’s nothing\nwrong with giving consumers the choice.\n\nA quick rising of your wrist brings the screen to life and this ensures every\ntime you look at the watch the time is visible. I’d even say the Apple Watch\nSeries 4 jumps into life faster than its predecessor. You can also more\ndiscreetly view the time by rotating the digital crown when the display is\noff. This turns the display on gradually, upping the brightness little by\nlittle.\n\nThe speaker now resides on the left-hand side of the watch, moved away from\nthe microphone to ensure there’s no interference between the two. The speaker\nitself is loud, ridiculously so for something this small. It’s a shame, then,\nthat you can’t really use it for much. It’s main function is to relay Siri\nanswer and queries back to you – something it handles well – but I’d like to\nalways use it for, say, listening to a podcast while i’m home.\n\n## **Apple Watch 4 – WatchOS 5 and performance**\n\nReleased alongside the Apple Watch 4, watchOS 5 brings a handful of software\nupdates and tweaks to all the previous Apple Watch models (aside from the very\nfirst version, often dubbed Series 0).\n\nThere’s no headline-grabbing feature in watchOS 5; instead it’s a mixture of\nbug fixes and smaller features. There’s now a Podcast app, for example, which\nis ideal if you want to leave your phone at home while you go to the gym, and\na new Walkie-Talkie feature that sends short audio messages to friends. You\ncan also track your Yoga workouts.\n\n![Apple Watch Series\n4](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nYou can play podcasts from the Apple Watch\n\nWatchOS includes a number of typical smartwatch features, too. Notifications\npop up from a linked iPhone (Apple Watch supports any iPhone from the 5S) and\ncan be acted upon either with canned responses or something more personal if\nit’s an app like iMessage. There are also apps for Maps, Email, Alarms and\nplenty more.\n\nPowering the Apple Watch Series 4 is the S4 chip; the first Watch 64-bit SoC\n(system on a chip) used by Apple. It claims it’s 2x faster than the S3,\nhowever testing these claims on a device like this is tricky.\n\nThis is a snappy watch, though, and one that jumps between faces, open apps\nand workout options quickly. You’ll still have to wait an age to open an app\nthat isn’t stored in memory, but with the dwindling reliance on actual apps in\nthe watchOS ecosystem it’s a problem I have rarely struggled with.\n\nThe improved performance also helps Siri react faster, and considering the\nslightly dodgy voice-assistant is still a big play here, that’s a bonus. Siri\ncan be initiated by either holding down the Digital Crown or raising the watch\nand saying, “Ok, Siri.”\n\nSiri is far from perfect and a feature I rarely use on my iPhone, yet on the\nwatch it’s arguably more useful. Asking it to start a timer when my hands are\nsticky with bread dough is ridiculously useful, and it’s good to know I’ll\nalways be reminded when the timer hits zero even if I leave my phone in\nanother room. Siri is also great for quick measurement calculations and\nweather checks.\n\n![Apple Watch Series\n4](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nThis is the Siri watch face\n\nSiri’s skills are also built into its own watch face. The Siri face debuted on\nWatchOS 4 and has received a boost this time around with some ‘machine\nlearning’ skills. Supposedly it’s meant to throw things like music playlists\nand directions into the stream of cards, but i’ve found it’s still rather\nuseless. Unless you like your watch being taken over by a random picture you\ntook last year, that is.\n\nApple Watch Series 4 comes in two variations: one with GPS, and another with\nGPS and LTE. I’ve been using the LTE model for this review and picking this\nconnected option will add an extra £/$100 to the price if you plump for the\naluminium watch. It comes as standard on the stainless steel versions.\n\nHonestly, if I was buying this watch for myself I wouldn’t pay the extra for\nLTE. That comes down in part to the poor support it has received from UK\ncarriers – it’s currently only supported by EE and Vodafone – and the fact\nit’ll add an extra £5 to your monthly bill. It’s also fairly limited and is\nmainly used only for taking/giving calls and replying to iMessages.\n\nStill, the actual way the LTE/4G functionality works is slick. Signal strength\nis reliable and those who I rang on the watch couldn’t notice any difference\nbetween it and a phone call.\n\n![Apple Watch Series\n4](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nYou can play Apple Music directly from the watch\n\nAnother benefit of having an LTE/4G connection is music streaming directly to\nthe watch. This is limited to Apple Music (sorry Spotify users) and is a\nfantastic gym addition – letting you leave your phone in the locker and remain\nconnected to an entire music library. Tunes can also be directly stored on the\ndevice and there’s 16GB available space to play with here. Syncing songs\nacross, however, can be a fiddly and ridiculously time-consuming process, and\nit’s something best left to work overnight.\n\n## **Apple Watch 4 – Health and fitness tracking**\n\nAfter the disappointing original Apple Watch, Apple focused more with the\nsuccessor, positioning it as an accessory for tracking runs, gym sessions and\nswims.\n\nThe Apple Watch 4 keeps all the fitness-tracking features, but diversifies\nslightly to add a more health-tracking aspect too. This is where the device\nmoves from expensive gadget to potential lifesaver.\n\nHowever, it’s hard to test out these new health-focused features. Fall\ndetection is one of the big new additions here and it works thanks to the new,\nmore accurate accelerometer sensors inside the body. In theory, fall detection\nwill alert you when you fall, slip or trip over; sending out an alert to\nemergency services and a selection of pre-selected contacts if you don’t move\nfor a certain period of time after the fall.\n\n**Related:[Best running watches](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nrunning-watches-3439010)**\n\nIt’s a tremendous idea and one that could save someone’s life. It’s not,\nhowever, something that can be triggered by pretending to fall or even being\npushed over. Trust me, I’ve tried.\n\nThis feature isn’t being aimed at me though; that’s made clear by the fact\nit’s turned off by default for anyone under 65. As someone who knows the\nproblems accidental falls can cause, this feature alone would instantly make\nme want to recommend this to older relatives. That’s not something I would\nhave said about a mass-market smartwatch before.\n\nAnother huge health benefit of the Apple Watch Series 4 is the\nelectrocardiogram sensor. With an update due later in the year, this sensor\nwill be able to take an ECG, feed you back the results and allow them to be\nshared with your doctor.\n\nThe ECG app will be able to tell if your heart shows signs of atrial\nfibrillation, a serious form of irregular heartbeat rhythm, or sinus rhythm –\na normal beating. This ECG app will only be available in North America to\nbegin with, as it requires approval and checks to ensure it work correctly.\nHopefully we’ll see it in other territories in the future.\n\nHealth might be the focus here, but the Apple Watch Series 4 remains an\nexcellent wearable for both keeping an eye on your daily movements and deeper\ntracking of gym-focused workouts, swimming and yoga. The watch is packed with\npretty much every sensor you’ll need: GPS, altimeter, improved accelerometer,\noptical/electric heart rate monitor and an ambient light sensor.\n\n![Apple Watch\n4](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nThe first of the two fitness-focused apps on the Apple Watch Series 4 is\nActivity. This is, in my opinion, the finest and most encouraging step-\ntracking app on any wearable you can buy today. If you’re coming from an older\nApple Watch though, you won’t notice anything different here.\n\nThe basis of this Activity app is three rings, each of which you’re encouraged\nto fill up during the day. One is Movement, another Exercise and the final,\nStand. When you first set-up the Apple Watch you’ll be prompted to enter some\nbasic details – gender, height, weight etc – and then it’ll give you suggested\ntargets for each, You can, of course, alter these manually afterwards. As an\nexample, I selected 800 calories burned in movement, 30 minutes exercise and\nto stand at least once every hour throughout the day. There’s still no way to\ninclude flights of stairs climbed as part of your daily goal, something\nRichard Easton requested in his Apple Watch 3 review.\n\nThe ring-based visual is a great way to ensure you’re always looking at your\nactivity, helping to motivate you to fill the rings. For instance, you’ll get\na buzz on the wrist if you haven’t stood up for a while, or a quick suggestion\nthat a ‘brisk 15-minute walk’ would fill up your movement ring for the day.\nIt’s encouraging, without being patronising or simply asking you to take\n10,000 steps.\n\n![Apple Watch\n4](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nAchievements are available if you hit certain targets and you can share and\ncompete with others if you need to add some extra spice.\n\nThe workout app is the place to go for more specific tracking, particular if\nyou want to track a run, swim, cycle or round of HIIT training.\n\nThe onboard GPS (a feature included on the LTE and non-LTE models) means you\ndon’t have to rely on a connected phone – like you’d have to do with the\n[Fitbit Versa](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/fitbit-versa) or\n[Withings Sport HR](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/steel-hr-sport) –\nand the results were very accurate during my testing. As not much of a runner,\nI tended to stick to shorter runs during the review process but the data it\ncaptured matched the distances I was travelling.\n\nBeing able to stream music directly to the watch and take any incoming calls\nmeans you can head out for a 10km run with just your watch and some\n[AirPods](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/airpods). When you’re running\nyou’ll also get heart rate data – again this data was comparable to both the\nolder Apple Watch 3 and a [Fitbit Charge\n2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/fitbit-charge-2) I was using as a\ncomparison.\n\nIf your heart rate rises above a certain level (120bpm) a warning will be\ntriggered on the watch. The same will happen if your heart rate drops below a\ncertain level or becomes irregular. Like the ECG, you’ll have to wait until an\nupdate later in the year to make use of low heart rate warnings.\n\n![Apple Watch 4\n](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nHeart rate is tracked over the day\n\nI’m more at home in the pool, and the Apple Watch 4 is great for swimmers. You\nchoose from either a pool or open water swim and after selecting the length\nit’ll keep you updated on lengths swam and calories burned. Once you’re\nfinished, it’ll combine everything into an easy-to-digest overview of your\nswim. WatchOS 5 also includes automatic activity tracking, so if you forget to\ninitiate a workout the likelihood is that the watch will know.\n\nAnother appreciated trick, and something Fitbit is enabling for the Charge 3,\nis being able to set targets for your workouts. You can set it so your swim\nlasts until you’ve burned through a certain amount of calories, or have run\nfor a certain distance.\n\nThere’s still no native sleep tracking on the Apple Watch 4, so you’ll be once\nagain using a third-party alternative to monitor your slumber. I’d guess Apple\nkeeps leaving this out because of the ‘all-day’ battery claim and the fact it\nassumes you’ll be charging the watch at night. When we get a device Apple can\ncomfortably say will last multiple days, that is when I think sleep tracking\nwill be introduced.\n\n**Related:[Best fitness trackers](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nfitness-tracker-3435397)**\n\nAs someone who would never wear a full-on running and rarely tracks runs or\nswims, having the Apple Watch 4 on is a constant stream of encouragement and\nactively makes me want to keep an eye on how much exercise I do. Workouts are\neasy to start and the information churned out is genuinely useful, which makes\nme want to keep on filling my rings each and every day.\n\n## **Apple Watch 4 – Battery life**\n\nBattery life is one of the few areas of the Apple Watch Series 4 that hasn’t\nreceived a huge update. Apple makes the same ‘all-day, 18 hours of usage’\nclaim it made for the Series 3 and during my time with the watch it has met,\nand often exceeded, that.\n\nApple’s vision of this watch is clearly something you wear during the day and\nplonk on the magnetic charger at night. That’s fine by me, even though I would\nappreciate it eventually becoming a multi-day wearable.\n\nHow long the Apple Watch Series 4 lasts hangs significantly on your usage. On\nthe days that it was purely tracking my movement, telling me the time, playing\npodcasts and alerting me to notifications, it would end the day at 35-40%,\nleaving enough spare juice had I forgot to charge it. There were even a few\noccasions where I would make it through two days without having to enable the\npower-saving mode. When it does drop below a certain percentage of remaining\njuice, the watch switches to a much simpler mode where the time is only\ndisplayed when you press one of the buttons.\n\nThe days when I was utilising the GPS for workout tracking or LTE for phone-\ncalling had a much more obvious effect on the battery. This is to be expected,\nof course. Still, the results I achieved were good.\n\n![Apple Watch\n4](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nThe charger plus onto the back of the Apple Watch 4\n\nRunning for an hour – with GPS, LTE and AirPods connected via Bluetooth – the\nApple Watch Series 4 lost between 17-23%. Disconnect the AirPods and remove\nthe LTE functionality and you’ll save about 6-8%. Obviously these times vary\ndepending on how often you check the watch and if you receive/take calls\nduring that period.\n\nLTE calling depletes the battery faster than hammering the GPS. This reaffirms\nthe point that this is purely meant as an addition to your phone, rather than\na futuristic wrist-based replacement for it.\n\nCharging is reasonably quick and requires about 45 minutes to reach 50% and\nmarginally less than two hours to get all the way to 100%, The charger itself\nremains a small magnetic puck, which clips onto the bottom of the watch. The\nmagnets are strong and it’s not easy to accidentally knock the watch off once\nit’s in place.\n\nIt is quite annoying having to always the remember the proprietary Apple Watch\ncharger though and it feels like Apple should have, by now, come up with a\nsimpler solution. [AirPower](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/delayed-\napple-airpower-wireless-charging-pad-may-doomed-failure-3582003) – a charging\nmate that’d juice up\n[AirPods](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/airpods), iPhones and Apple\nWatch simultaneously – seemed like the solution, but has yet to materialise.\n\n## **Why buy the Apple Watch 4?**\n\nApple Watch Series 4 is not only the most impressive Apple Watch yet, but is\ncomfortably the most fully featured smartwatch I have ever tested. It’s\nApple’s best, most thought-out release in years.\n\nIt’s a masterful combination of design; genuinely useful features and an\nimpressive ecosystem. Apple’s ability to push categories like phones and\nlaptop forward has diminished over recent years, but this wearable is so far\nahead of competitors such as the [Samsung Galaxy\nWatch](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-watch) and Wear\nOS releases from Fossil that it almost seems unfair.\n\nPair the updated design featuring that gorgeous screen with the vast array of\n(potentially) life-saving features and you’ve _finally_ got a smartwatch that\nfeels like something other than a luxury device missing a point.\n\nNothing is perfect though, and I would still like to see an Apple Watch that\ntracks my sleep natively and doesn’t require plugging in at least every other\nnight. But they’re just minor quibbles in the grand scheme of things.\n\n## **Verdict**\n\nThe Apple Watch 4 is the best smartwatch I have ever used.\n\n## Score\n\n  \n\n"}
