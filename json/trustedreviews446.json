As one of, if\nnot the biggest game on the planet right now, offering different options to\nplayers is always a good thing. Currently, the cheapest bundle option for\nBattle Royale is the starter pack, which costs just £3.99 and includes a skin,\na back bling, and 600 V-Bucks. Going further down the maths rabbit hole, 1000\nV-Bucks costs £7.99, so the 600 V-Bucks alone in the starter pack already gets\nyou your money back in V-Bucks. Throw in the skin and the back bling and it’s\na pretty snazzy deal.\n\nIt looks like, judging from the pricing and the items offered, the Deep Freeze\nBundle is following in those footsteps. £25 would net you roughly 2,800\nV-Bucks in-game, give or take. A skin like this would be around 1,500 (if\nwe’re pricing at the lower end of the spectrum), the glider around 800 – same\nfor the pick – and while you can’t currently buy back blings separately,\ncombine that with the 1,000 extra V-Bucks and it’s not the worst package in\nthe world.\n\nAs always if you’ve ever got any burning Fortnite questions – like what’s a\nV-Buck? – you can always check out our [Fortnite Season 6\nhub](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/fortnite-season-6-news-update-skins-\nweapons-battle-pass-challenges-3505854).
