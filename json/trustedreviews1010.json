Instead, binary add-ons\n– which are things like PVRs, screensavers, and visualisations – will be\nhoused in a central repository for you to install separately, just like some\nof the other addons Kodi users might be familiar with.\n\nNow that the Kodi software you download will just feature the basics, it also\nmeans you don’t have to download an entire build just to refresh your binary\naddons, as they can be updated independent of the larger platform.\n\n> Important Kodi v18 notice: You need to install any PVR, Screensaver,\nVisualisation, Image decoder or even certain file systems that you used before\nfrom the Binary repo like any other addon.  \n> Read here:<https://t.co/ctL4MxWnZ1>\n[pic.twitter.com/3mEhv0cQOu](https://t.co/3mEhv0cQOu)\n\n>\n\n> — Kodi (@KodiTV) [October 24,\n2018](https://twitter.com/KodiTV/status/1055086429968195584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nThe new binary repository is currently available for Kodi v18 Leia on Android,\nmacOS and Windows, and you can find Kodi downloads for all manner of operating\nsystems – including Android and iOS – [here.](https://kodi.tv/download) Note\nthat the iOS version retains pre-installed binary addons due to “platform\nlimitations”.\n\nAlternatively, the full Kodi 18 Leia beta 4 change log is available to\n[view](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/milestone/113?closed=1) on GitHub and\nthere’s a blog [post](https://kodi.tv/article/kodi-v18-leia-beta-4) on the\ngroup’s website offering an overview of the key changes.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\n**Let us know what you think of Kodi 18 Leia on Twitter @TrustedReviews.**\n\n"}
