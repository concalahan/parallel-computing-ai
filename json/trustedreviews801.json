We explain the Wi-Fi name changes.**\n\nIt’s good news for ordinary internet users today as the Wi-Fi Alliance has\nrevealed that it is ditching its clunky Wi-Fi standard branding in favour of\nnew, easy to understand labels.\n\nThe latest generation Wi-Fi standard, 802.11ax, becomes Wi-Fi 6, while older\n(but still more widely used) specifications 802.11ac and 802.11n become Wi-Fi\n5 and Wi-Fi 4, respectively.\n\nAnything that pre-dates 802.11n/Wi-Fi 4 isn’t officially getting renamed, but\nif you wanted to, you could extend the overhaul all the back to 1999’s\n802.11b, which would now be Wi-Fi 1.\n\nThe move is designed to help consumers better understand which Wi-Fi standard\ntheir devices support, the Wi-Fi Alliance said, adding that it expects\nhardware manufacturers to begin adopting the simplified version numbering on\nits products in the immediate future, along with the newly revealed logos. By\nway of reference, that’s an official Wi-Fi Alliance mocked up ‘Wi-Fi 6’\nsticker at the top of the page.\n\nIt’ll also be more easy to understand the speed capabilities of networks in\nthe future, if the Alliance gets its way, as it wants to see the numbers added\nto the end of Wi-Fi connections, so you’ll be able to opt to link up your\ndevice to a ‘5’ over a ‘4’, in theory.\n\n**Related:[Best routers](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nrouter-3444249)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n> “For nearly two decades, Wi-Fi users have had to sort through technical\nnaming conventions to determine if their devices support the latest Wi-Fi. Wi-\nFi Alliance is excited to introduce Wi-Fi 6, and present a new naming scheme\nto help industry and Wi-Fi users easily understand the Wi-Fi generation\nsupported by their device or connection,” commented Wi-Fi Alliance President\nand CEO Edgar Figueroa.\n\nHere’s a brief summary of the key Wi-Fi naming changes.\n\n  * 802.11ax is now **Wi-Fi 6**\n  * 802.11ac is now **Wi-Fi 5**\n  * 802.11n is now **Wi-Fi 4**\n\nWe reckon the new Wi-Fi names can only be a good thing, as the old ones were\nfairly convoluted and difficult for most consumers to decipher. Now, whether\nyou’re considering buying a new device or trying to get the most out of an\nexisting one, it’ll be a lot easier to know what Wi-Fi speeds it’s capable of\nsupporting.\n\n**Got any questions about the new Wi-Fi names?
