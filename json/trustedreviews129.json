We’ve rounded up some problems we’ve noticed with iOS 11, and ways to\nfix them.\n\n## **iOS 11 problems: Not enough space to install**\n\nA classic iOS problem: If you’re still rocking a 16GB iPhone that’s nearly\nfull, then you might have problems actually downloading iOS 11. Apple’s latest\nupdate requires over 2GB of free space on your phone, which on a 16GB device\nis quite a lot.\n\nThe first way around this is to simply delete some old photos and videos, but\nobviously that’s not ideal. iOS can also suggest apps to remove until the\nupdate is completed, and then it will reinstall then.\n\n**Related:[iPhone X – Everything you need to\nknow](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-x-release-date-specs-\nfeatures-uk-price-2951157)**\n\nBut the easiest way around this annoying issue is to simply plug in your\niPhone to a Mac or PC running iTunes and install it this way. This downloads\nthe software on your computer, rather than your phone, so you don’t need that\nfree space.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\n## **Can’t send Exchange email in iOS 11**\n\nIf you’re using an Exchange or Office 365 account through the Mail app in iOS\n11, you might be getting a ‘ _Cannot Send Mail. This message was rejected by\nthe server’_ error message when you try and send an email.\n\n[Apple has actually confirmed this is a bug with iOS\n11](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208136) and it has said it will be\nfixing it in an upcoming update.\n\nWe have actually encountered this problem ourselves, and found a good way to\nsolve it is to switch from Wi-Fi to mobile data to send your message.\n\n## **Photo incompatibility**\n\nOne of the smaller changes in iOS 11 relates to how pictures and videos you\ntake are saved. Previously, iOS would save these in the very popular JPEG and\nH.264 formats, but it has now switched to HEIF and HEVC. These are new formats\nthat offer better quality even when compressed, hopefully saving you space,\nbut as they’re brand-new there will likely be some compatibility problems.\n\nFor instance, early on in the iOS 11 beta process these new formats weren’t\nsupported by Google Photos. Thankfully, Google updated its app and it now\nworks fine.\n\n**Related:[iPhone 8 vs iPhone\n7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-8-vs-iphone-7-3286334)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIf you’d rather not deal with these pestering issues, you can revert back to\nthe older formats. Just head into **Settings > Camera > Formats and click\n‘More Compatible**’.\n\n## **Apps not working in iOS 11**\n\nWith the switch to iOS 11, Apple has finally killed support for phones and\napps that are still 32-bit. Apple switched to a 64-bit processor with the\niPhone 5S, and this means any phone before this isn’t compatible with iOS 11.\n\nIt all means that any app not updated in the last few years to support 64-bit\nwill not work anymore.\n\n**Found any problems with iOS 11?
