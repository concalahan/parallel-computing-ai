{"result": 0, "title": "Samsung Galaxy Note 9 review | Trusted Reviews", "description": "*   * ![Samsung Galaxy Note 9 front]()Samsung’s panels also have much better colours than competing OLEDs from LG –in my opinion, anyway – and that’s certainly the case here. In the defaultmode everything looks vibrant and punchy, without sacrificing too much colouraccuracy. There might be slightly more punch to reds than you’d see in reallife, but I think that’s more pleasing to the eye here.In their infancy OLEDs on phones suffered with poor brightness and as a resulthad difficulty with poor outdoor visibility. That’s not the case here: thepanel is ridiculously bright and I tended to not even feel the need to push itpast 45-50%. The brightness will also boost in super-bright environmentsmaking it easy to read.**Related:[Samsung S9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9)**One minor issue, especially in sunnier situations, is reflections on thatcurved display. This has been an issue for all Samsung phones with this designtrait and it remains here. It doesn’t affect usability too much though, and Igot used to it after a few days.[ Next  S Pen, Performance and Software](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-9-s-pen-performance-and-software)"}
