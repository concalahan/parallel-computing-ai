Apparently, this is made possible\nusing a custom fanless cooling technology built by Acer that’s being dubbed\nDual LiquidLoop.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: Acer | Acer Switch\n\nInside the laptop, you’ll find an [8th-generation Intel\nCore](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/intel-8th-gen-core-specs-technology-\nexplained-2952599) i7 processor and Nvidia’s GeForce MX150 graphics card, an\nentry-level mobile GPU. The laptop itself weighs less than 1.15kg with the\nkeyboard detached, and features a brushed aluminium body that Acer says offers\n“a robust feel and beautiful tactile touch”.\n\nAcer has equipped the Switch 7 Black Edition with a large 13.5-inch IPS\ndisplay that offers a resolution of 2256 x 1504 pixels. It runs on Window 10,\nsupports Windows Hello, and even includes an optical-based under-glass\nfingerprint sensor that lets you power on the device through user\nauthentication.\n\nThe Acer Switch 7 Black Edition is the most expensive of the new laptop line-\nup, and will be available in Europe from December, starting at €1,999.\n\n**Related:[Best laptops for\nstudents](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-laptops-for-students)**\n\n## Acer Swift 5\n\nNext up is the Swift 5 ( _pictured above_ ), a new machine that Acer says is\ndesigned for users who want portability, performance, and style to boot.\n\nThe lightweight chassis is the main selling point – this device weighs less\nthan 1kg, which is Apple MacBook territory. The weight is kept down thanks to\na “sophisticated selection of materials” that includes magnesium-lithium\nallots for the top and bottom cover, and magnesium-aluminium alloys for\nadditional sturdiness on the palm-rest area. Last year’s [Swift\n5](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/acer-swift-5) weighed in at nearly\n1.4kg, so this is a big deal.\n\nAs expected, the Acer Swift 5 also features an 8th-generation Intel Core\nprocessor (unspecified at this point), and boasts a fairly generous 8-hour\nbattery life. There’s a Full HD IPS touchscreen display too, which – when\npaired with Dolby Audio Premium sound – should make for respectable Netflix\nbingeing.\n\nAcer is selling the Swift 5 in Europe starting in December, with a confirmed\nrecommended retail price of €1,099.\n\n## Acer Chromebook 15\n\nAcer’s latest all-metal Chromebook is a bit of a beast, weighing in at over\n1.7kg, packing a 15.6-inch screen. With that bulk you get a laptop that’s said\nto last 12 hours on a single charge. This is thanks to its low power Intel\nCeleron or Pentium processor, which will offer modest performance in exchange\nfor power efficiency. You get a Full HD screen, upwards-facing speakers and a\nwide-angle webcam, along with Google’s lightweight Chrome OS.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIt’ll go on sale in October for $399 (probably £399) in a variety of\nspecifications, so watch this space for what we get here in Blightly.\n\n## Acer Spin 5\n\nLast, but certainly not least, is the Acer Spin 5, a lightweight convertible\nmachine that prices in cheaper than all the other laptops revealed during the\nannouncement.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: Acer | Acer Spin\n\nThe Spin 5 comes in 13-inch and 15-inch variants, the former of which weighs\njust 1.5kg and measures in at a svelte 15.9mm. It also features an 8th-\ngeneration Intel Core processor, and can be equipped with up to 16GB of DDR4\nmemory.\n\nOther configuration options include up to 13 hours of battery life and a\ndiscrete [Nvidia GeForce GTX\n1050](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-gtx-1050) graphics\ncard option for the 15-inch model.\n\nThe Acer Spin 5 will be available in Europe from September, with the 13-inch\nmodel starting at €899 and the 15-inch model setting you back €999.\n\n**Related:[Best laptops](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-laptops)**\n\n**What do you think of Acer’s new fare?
