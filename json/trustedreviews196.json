It would be less\nmadcap than making cardboard robots, after all, and that’s a ****bizarre dream\nthat the company has made a glorious reality with[Nintendo\nLabo](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nintendo-labo)** **.**\n\nNintendo [has ](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/01/nintendo-is-not-\nhopping-on-the-vr-bandwagon-any-time-soon/)denied it’s interested in virtual\nreality, but modders have uncovered a setting hidden away deep within the code\nthat suggests this might not be entirely true.\n“ICommonStateGetter::SetVrModeEnabled(bool)”, one line of code reads.\n\n**Related:**[ **Nintendo Switch\ngames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/nintendo-switch-games-3435122)\n\nSo what happens if you enable this? This, according to one Twitter modder:\n\n> <https://t.co/wSPNcuuGVa>  \n> So I just tried and a screen appeared. Interesting…\n[pic.twitter.com/MLiKfYpokb](https://t.co/MLiKfYpokb)\n\n>\n\n> — random (@random666_kys) [August 8,\n2018](https://twitter.com/random666_kys/status/1027156369877749760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nFor any of you who can’t watch the video right now, the screen splits into two\nimages, before showing the caption “Éloigner la console de votre visage puis\ntouchez fermer”. Google translates that as “Keep your face [by] the console\nand touch close,” which feels like pretty standard advice for using VR, where\nthe image is split into two for each eye.\n\nUnfortunately, that’s all it does. When you press close, nothing happens,\nwhich is hardly surprising given this is not an officially – or even\nunofficially – supported mode for the Switch.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nSo is this proof that Nintendo was or is looking at VR? It’s possible, but a\nmore mundane explanation for this hidden code may lie in the architecture of\nthe system. The Switch, like the Nvidia Shield and Google Pixel C, uses a\nNvidia Tegra X1 SoC. In other words, this code could just be a leftover from\nAndroid’s own graphics APIs rather than something Nintendo has been noodling\nwith.\n\n**Related:**[ **Upcoming Nintendo Switch\ngames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/upcoming-nintendo-switch-\ngames-3522184)\n\nOn the other hand, the translation above does specifically use the word\n“console”. Would you describe an Android tablet or the Nvidia Shield as a\nconsole? Where’s a French language expert when you need one?\n\nEven if it _is_ some kind of hidden VR mode specifically for Nintendo Switch,\nit’s worth setting expectations at a low bar. The Switch screen can output at\n1280 x 720. Halve that (one screen per eye) and you’re looking at a ropey\nresolution of 640 x 360. PSVR, for comparison, outputs at 1080 x 1200.\n\nAdd to that the need to output a solid 60fps for each eye to avoid motion\nsickness, and you’re looking at quite a tough challenge for the Switch, no\nmatter how many units Nintendo has sold.\n\n**Would you like to see Nintendo embrace VR on the Switch?
