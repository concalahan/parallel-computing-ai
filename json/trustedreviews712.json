The first\n–the [NUCLUN](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-confirms-own-nuclun-cpu-\nand-first-phone-to-be-powered-by-it) – actually landed on the LG G3 Screen,\nand didn’t go down too well.\n\nThe second was intended to be a direct [Snapdragon\n810](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/snapdragon-810-features) rival,\nand would feature four Cortex-A57 cores and four Cortex-A53 cores. This was\nscrapped apparently, however, due to technical issues.\n\nIt’s worth noting that ARM’s Cortex-A72 processor is destined for 2016\nsmartphones, so we probably won’t see LG’s chip offering in any of this year’s\nhandsets at least.\n\nLG will likely stick with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon chips for its 2015 flagships,\nwith the [LG G Flex 2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/lg-g-flex-2-review)\nalready confirmed to be carrying the Snapdragon 810.\n\n"}
