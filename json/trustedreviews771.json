This means we might see a a\ncheaper iPhone at Apple’s September launch event, or the range might adopt the\nname scheme of the iPad, where release years are used to denote particular\nmodels.\n\nHowever, we’ve also [seen rumours](https://www.cultofmac.com/548389/iphone-\nse-2-iphone-x/) (via a CAD render from a case manufacturer, shown below) that\nthe new handset could follow the design cues of the iPhone X with an edge-to-\nedge display and a display notch, allowing it to pack a much larger display\ninto a handset of the same size.\n\n**Related:[iPhone X Plus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-x-\nplus-2018-release-date-specs-price-rumours-3461723)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nImage credit: Olixar\n\nAnother report has claimed that the handset will see the return of the\nheadphone jack to Apple’s handsets. Considering the budget nature of the\nrange, not having to use expensive wireless headphones or an adaptor would be\nvery welcome.\n\nHowever, other reports have claimed the exact opposite about the 3.5mm jack,\nso it’s still all to play for.\n\nSpeaking of high-end features, the phone might make use of Apple’s excellent\nFace ID tech that made its debut in the iPhone X if [a report\nin](https://www.cultofmac.com/547793/iphone-se-with-face-id-could-debut-in-\nseptember/) _Macotakara_ is to be believed.\n\nThere are also rumours flying that the internals of the iPhone SE 2 will\nfeature an A11 Bionic CPU like what we’ve already seen in the iPhone 8 and X.\nIf true this would make it an incredibly powerful little phone, but only time\nwill tell whether these rumours are correct.\n\nRead on for everything we know so far about the rumoured iPhone SE 2.\n\n**Related:[Apple Pencil 2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-\npencil-2-release-date-3433463)**\n\n## iPhone SE 2 Name: What will it be called?\n\nAlthough reports have been claiming that the SE 2 is currently in development\nunder the codename ‘Jaguar’, that’s obviously not the name the phone will be\nreleased under.\n\nPreviously, the prevailing logic has been that the phone will be released with\nthe name ‘iPhone SE 2’, but more recently [a leak has\nclaimed](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-se-2018-name-headphone-\njack-3463002) that the phone will have exactly the same name as its\npredecessor, indicating that it will be adopting the same naming scheme as the\niPad, which keeps the same name from year to year.\n\nThe leak comes courtesy of Evan Blass, who tends to be very reliable with this\nkind of information.\n\n> [pic.twitter.com/1223C0s70N](https://t.co/1223C0s70N)\n\n>\n\n> — Evan Blass (@evleaks) [May 11,\n2018](https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/994931903470931968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nFor now though, we’re going to continue referring to the phone as the SE 2.\n\n## iPhone SE 2 release date\n\nWith the iPhone SE having been released at a dedicated event in March 2016, we\ninitially had our fingers crossed that we would see an appearance at Apple’s\neducation-themed event in Chicago in March 2018, alongside the [new 2018\niPad.](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/new-ipad-2018-release-date-specs-\nprice-rumours-leaks-3423309) , and that got our hopes up for [WWDC\n2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/wwdc-2018-dates-rumors-news-3399519)\nin June.\n\nAlas.\n\nBoth events came and went without any mention of any iPhone whatsoever, so the\nnext possible announcement date could be otherwise a launch could have to wait\nuntil Apple’s main iPhone launch event in September, a date favoured by a\n[recent report](https://www.cultofmac.com/547793/iphone-se-with-face-id-could-\ndebut-in-september/) in _Cult of Mac_ , which claimed that the phone would be\nannounced alongside the company’s next flagships.\n\n**Related:[New iPad Pro (2018)](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ipad-\npro-2018-release-date-specs-price-3482812)**\n\n## iPhone SE 2 price\n\nWith its compact form-factor, the iPhone SE has always been meant as the\nbudget sibling of the iPhone family, and we’d expect this to continue with the\niPhone SE 2.\n\nThe price of the current iPhone SE starts at just £349, while the mainstream\niPhone 8 and 8 Plus start at £699 and £799 respectively. In an ideal world\nwe’d love to see the SE 2 hit the same price point as the current SE, but a\nslightly increased price is more likely.\n\n### Trusted Reviews Exclusive iPhone XS Deal\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n###\n\n[Apple iPhone XS – 10GB, £40pm with £350 upfront on O2\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\nGiving you plenty of data for the low price of just £40 a month, this monthly\ncontract with O2 is an incredible deal that can't be missed if you want to be\none of the first people to own an iPhone XS.\n\n[Mobiles.co.uk\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n|\n\n£350 upfront\n\n|\n\n£40/month\n\n[View\nDeal](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n£40/month\n\n|\n\n£350 upfront\n\n|\n\n[Mobiles.co.uk\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n## iPhone SE 2 concepts\n\nWith Apple not having shown off any official images of the rumoured phone,\nfans have stepped in to give their interpretation of what the SE 2 could end\nup looking like.\n\nRenowned concept designer [Martin Hajek](https://www.martinhajek.com/iphone-\nse2-revealed/) has developed one such render that closely mimics the design of\nthe current SE. It’s got the same square edges as the current model, while\nalso integrating design flourishes from the iPhone 8 including a small camera\nbump and a single solid back colour. Inspired by this year’s WWDC invite, it\ncertainly looks the part and also suggests that wireless charging might\nfeature.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAnother concept has come from EverythingApplePro, and can be seen in the\nYouTube link below. This concept eliminates the camera bump, but keeps a\nuniform back colour.\n\nBoth concepts remove the headphone jack from the current iPhone SE. The 3.5mm\njack first disappeared with the iPhone 7, and last year’s models showed no\nsigns of Apple reversing the trend.\n\n## iPhone SE 2 specs and design\n\nThe strongest rumour we’ve heard so far about the SE 2’s design comes from a\nvideo posted on the social network Weibo. The video shows a handset that’s\nborrowed heavily from the design cues of the iPhone X, including curved edges,\nthe removal of the home button, and even a small X-style notch on the top of\nthe screen.\n\nThe concept also shows off a small camera bump on the rear of the phone\ncontaining a dual camera configuration.\n\nThis design was later backed up by a subsequent report that claimed that the\nphone would come [complete with Face\nID](https://www.cultofmac.com/547793/iphone-se-with-face-id-could-debut-in-\nseptember/), which is consistent with the lack of home button seen in the\nvideo. A [later rumour](https://www.cultofmac.com/548389/iphone-\nse-2-iphone-x/) that originated with a well known case manufacturer added\nfurther fuel to this fire by again claiming that the phone would boast an\nedge-to-edge display and an X-style notch.\n\n**Related:[New Mac Mini (2018)](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/mac-\nmini-2018-release-date-3552537)**\n\nBut the iPhone X similarities don’t stop there. Well-regarded mobile leaker\nand designer Ben Geskin has\n[shared](https://twitter.com/VenyaGeskin1/status/987629167108902912) the\nfollowing render and design rumours on Twitter, suggesting that the iPhone SE\n2 would get a glass back and wireless charging capabilities in line with the\nflagship handset.\n\n> New iPhone (probably SE2) coming soon – code name: Jaguar  \n> Glass Case, Wireless Charging, In Mass Production already.\n[pic.twitter.com/vhcq71VPxJ](https://t.co/vhcq71VPxJ)\n\n>\n\n> — Ben Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) [April 21,\n2018](https://twitter.com/VenyaGeskin1/status/987629167108902912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nIn terms of the internals of the phone, some rumours point towards an A11 chip\nbeing used, while others suggest an earlier generation A10 chipset is more\nlikely. Our guess is that Apple will use the A10 chipset, to keep the SE 2\naffordable, and to ensure it’s specs don’t match the premium iPhones released\nlast year.\n\nThe question of the headphone jack remains contentious, with some claiming\nthat it [won’t have\none](http://www.macotakara.jp/blog/rumor/entry-34838.html), while others claim\nthat [it will](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-se-2018-name-\nheadphone-jack-3463002).\n\nFinally, the iPhone SE 2 is also tipped to be on the receiving end of a mighty\ncamera upgrade, with some claiming that it will be treated to the same\n12-megapixel sensor as the iPhone 8 (no, not the dual-camera found on the\nlarger [iPhone 8 Plus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-8-plus)).\n\n**Related:[Best cheap phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-cheap-\nmobile-phones)**\n\n![iPhone 8\nback](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\niPhone 8\n\n## iPhone SE 2 Rumours and News: What we’d like to see in the iPhone SE 2\n\nOur main concern with the iPhone SE 2 is that it continues in the same spirit\nof the existing iPhone SE. That means that wherever possible an affordable\nprice should take priority over premium features.\n\nSo while it would be nice to see functionality like an edge-to-edge display,\nwireless charging, Face ID, and a dual camera trickle down from the higher end\nmodels, we don’t want them to be included if they’re going to push the price\nof the iPhone SE 2 over £400.\n\nWe’d like the headphone jack to make a return on the iPhone SE 2, but we’re\nnot going to get our hopes up too much. In our minds, a budget phone will\nlikely be purchased by someone who doesn’t want to spend a lot of money on\nexpensive wireless headphones, making a physical jack a priority.\n\nAside from that we’re excited to see what Apple brings to the table with a\nbudget phone in 2018.\n\n**Related:[Best iPhone X deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-\niphone-x-deals-3289493)**\n\n### The top iPhone 8 Plus deals right now\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=6224&clickref=TR-\niPhoneBlackFriday&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fonehouse.co.uk%2FiPhone-8-Plus-64GB%3Fhtrid%3D94121)\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=6224&clickref=TR-\niPhoneBlackFriday&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fonehouse.co.uk%2FiPhone-8-Plus-64GB%3Fhtrid%3D94121)\n\n###\n\n[ Apple iPhone 8 Plus – 50GB, £48/month and no upfront cost on EE\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=6224&clickref=TR-\niPhoneBlackFriday&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fonehouse.co.uk%2FiPhone-8-Plus-64GB%3Fhtrid%3D94121)\n\nA massive 50GB monthly allowance makes this Vodafone contract a great option\nfor all you hardcore gamers, streamers and surfers out there.
