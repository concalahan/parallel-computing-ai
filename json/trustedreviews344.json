Last year’s\nflagship iPhone signified a fork in Apple’s smartphone design language, most\nnotably with the adoption of an elongated display and the characteristic notch\n– a feature that’s become commonplace in 2018.\n\nThe X and XR both take the form of a sandwich of curved glass with a metal\nframe bordering the face and back – polished stainless steel on the iPhone X,\ncolour-matched matte 7000 series aluminium on the XR. Whichever handset you\npick, there’s no headphone jack here, just the company’s own Lightning\nconnector at the base. The 5.8-inch display of the older X is dwarfed by the\nnewer, larger 6.1-inch Liquid Retina Display on the XR. Despite its additional\nsize, however, you could argue that it offers the weaker viewing experience;\nit trades AMOLED technology for LCD (even though Apple claims this is “the\nmost advanced LCD ever in a smartphone”).\n\nBoth handsets are pretty hardy, too, thanks to IP67 dust and water-resistance,\nwhilst their glass-backed bodies also accommodate Qi wireless charging.\n\nThe iPhone X gave us our first taste of Face ID, doing away with the long-\nstanding Touch ID-laden physical home button that once defined the look of an\niPhone. Instead, it incorporated Apple’s new TrueDepth camera array, plus\nAnimoji – a feature unique to the X amid 2017’s iPhone crop. Now all three of\nthis year’s entrants, including the iPhone XR, sport a TrueDepth sensor of\ntheir own and, as such, share in the X’s\n[Animoji](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-x-animoji-3335178) and,\nnow, Memoji support.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\n## iPhone XR vs iPhone XR – Specs and features\n\nBeyond the TrueDepth sensor and the capabilities it facilitates, the handsets\nshare a few other features too. They offer the same 64GB and 256GB storage\nconfigurations, although the XR also comes in a 512GB configuration; both run\niOS 12 (with the iPhone X getting an upgrade from iOS 11); both pack in\n7-megapixel front-facing cameras; and both support HDR10 and Dolby Vision.\n\n| **iPhone X** | **iPhone XR**  \n---|---|---  \n**Display** |  5.8-inch 1124 x 2436 AMOLED | 6.1-inch 1792 x 828 IPS LCD  \n**Processor** |  Apple A11 Bionic | Apple A12 Bionic  \n**Rear camera** |  Dual 12-megapixels | Single 12-megapixels  \n**Front camera** |  7-megapixels | 7-megapixels  \n**Software** |  iOS 12 (upgraded from iOS 11) | iOS 12  \n**Storage** |  64/256GB | 64/256/512GB  \n  \nApple’s A11 Bionic chip is still proving to be a formidable piece of silicon\nin benchmarking tests. It continues to render the iPhone X an unquestionably\nresponsive handset, delivering a flagship-class experience whether you’re\nbrowsing social media, gaming or enjoying an augmented-reality experience. The\nXR’s newer A12 Bionic chip simply takes things up a notch and should top the\niPhone X in every benchmark and real-world performance test you can throw at\nit.\n\n## iPhone XR vs iPhone X – Camera\n\nThe biggest visible difference, aside from size, may well be what lies on the\nback of both of these robust smartphones. The iPhone X’s dual 12-megapixel\ncamera array sat atop the pile with regards to features and quality when\ncompared to what its launch siblings, the [iPhone\n8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-8) and [iPhone 8\nPlus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-8-plus), had to offer.\n\nThe main advantage of that dual setup is lossless optical zoom, which the\nsingle sensor on the XR lacks. Despite its monocular configuration though it’s\nthe first iPhone that retains the company’s portrait mode (which throws subtle\nbackground blur or virtual lighting effects into the mix) technology on the\nrear camera too.\n\n## iPhone XR vs iPhone X – Price\n\nUnless you were living under a rock from September to November time last year,\nyou would have heard about the £1000/$1000 iPhone. Due to the technical\nadvancements that Apple brought about with the iPhone X, the company decided\nthat its new top handset justified a bump up to the ceiling of iPhone starting\nprices. At £999/$999 for the base 64GB model, the iPhone X was\nunapologetically pricey.\n\nThe newer iPhone XR, meanwhile, is a slightly different proposition. It’s\nstill far from an affordable handset at £749/$749, but provided you’re okay\nmissing out on the X’s superior screen and dual camera, you can pick up a more\npowerful smartphone with greater future-proofing for a touch less.\n\n### Best iPhone XR Deals\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=tr-\niphonexr&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xr-64gb-\nblack%3Ftariffcode%3DDD1ZMFEB18)\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=tr-\niphonexr&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xr-64gb-\nblack%3Ftariffcode%3DDD1ZMFEB18)\n\n###\n\n[Apple iPhone XR 64GB Black – 4GB of data on Vodafone (use code TRUSTED10)\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=tr-\niphonexr&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xr-64gb-\nblack%3Ftariffcode%3DDD1ZMFEB18)\n\nIf you don't mind paying an upfront cost and only need a moderate amount of\ndata a month, this contract gets you a low monthly cost.
