In a statement issued to _Trusted Reviews_ , a representative\nannounced that there’s a new 13MP camera sensor that’s equipped with Phase-\ndetection and autofocus.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**LG K10 Plus**\n\nThey also noted that the LG K10 (2018) will be available in a total of three\nvariants: K10, K10 Alpha and K10 Plus. All three will come with a 5.3-inch HD\n(1280 x 720) screen, a 1.5GHz octa-core CPU and a 3000mAh non-removable\nbattery.\n\nThe latter will, however, have 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage as standard,\nwhile the former and middle will have a mere 2GB and 16GB. Oh, and they won’t\nall come with the same camera setup. The K10 Alpha will have a smaller 8MP\nsensor.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**LG K8**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nLG said the K8 (2018) hasn’t been treated to as big of an upgrade as the K10.\nIt has a revamped 8MP rear-facing camera, a faster rear-mounted fingerprint\nscanner, a 1.3GHz quad-core CPU and 2GB of RAM (up from 1.5GB), but that’s\nabout it.\n\nMobile World Congress (MWC 2018) is scheduled to run from February 26 through\nMarch 1. A number of leading manufacturers – including Huawei, LG, Samsung and\nSony – are expected to take the wraps off new hardware at the gathering.\n\n**Related:[Galaxy S9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-\ngalaxy-s9-release-date-specs-features-price-uk-3266552)**\n\n**Does the LG K8 (2018) or LG K10 (2018) sound like something you’d be\ninterested in finding out more about?
