Choices you make will impact the fate of characters\nand the troubled society they inhabit.\n\nThe idea that technology will eventually come to surpass us is nothing new.\nAfter all, we live in a society where artificial intelligence is advancing all\nthe time. Mainstream media loves to hone in on the premise that AI will\nsuddenly gain sentience and put the human race to bed. In reality, it’s a\nlittle more complicated than that. But envisioning such a future is\nfascinating, as the works of Philip K Dick, Isaac Asimov and countless others\ndemonstrate.\n\nAnd now, Quantic Dream wants to tackle the ideas of robotic sentience and\ntrans-humanism with Detroit: Become Human. It fails in some aspects, tackling\nmature themes with juvenile detail and a distinct lack of nuance. But, this\ndoesn’t stop it from being an exceptional narrative adventure that had me\nhooked throughout.\n\n**Order Detroit: Become Human from**[ **Amazon UK**](https://amzn.to/2k9jF18)\n\n![Detroit Become\nHuman](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nDetroit: Become Human has you playing as three main protagonists across an\noverarching narrative. Connor is a highly advanced android detective, tasked\nwith investigating other androids known as deviants. Next up is Kara – a young\nfemale android who finds herself caring for a young girl amidst a city slowly\nfalling to ruin. Finally, we have Markus. He is a deviant himself, who slowly\ncomes to lead a revolution for his kind all over the world.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nConnor is the undeniable highlight here, partly because his narrative avoids\nventuring into themes Quantic Dream simply doesn’t have the talent to tackle\nproperly. Instead, it’s a sci-fi buddy cop experience, where you work\nalongside grumpy police lieutenant, Hank, who’s hiding a dark past you’ll soon\nuncover.\n\nTheir relationship is formulaic yet engrossing, presenting a growing dynamic\nthat felt genuine. Watching as Hank goes from despising Connor to treating him\nas not only a partner but a friend was touching, even if the conclusion lacked\nresolution.\n\nThe quality of Connor’s story also transitions into how the game plays, as his\nsections are the most inventive, action-packed and emotionally resonant to\ncontrol. For example, the opening scene is a fantastically thrilling race\nagainst time as you scan evidence scattered across a crime scene, while a\nhostage situation unfolds only a few feet away. One mistake and it’s all over.\n\nScouring for clues as the situation unfolds is thrilling, and it can end in so\nmany ways. After multiple playthroughs I saw Connor talk the suspect down and\nsacrifice himself. The outcome can have a major impact on the unfolding\nnarrative, and knowing that playable characters might not see the end is an\nincentive to stay on your toes.\n\nSadly, it becomes clear the plot can’t veer off the tracks too much or the\ncore message of androids and their position in society is lost.\n\nThe outcome of significant events can be changed depending on the choices you\nmake, but this doesn’t alter the quality of writing or themes being addressed\nin Detroit: Become Human.\n\n**Related:**[ **Upcoming PS4\nGames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/upcoming-ps4-games)\n\n![Detroit Become\nHuman](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nKara’s story is a one of parenthood, as she tries to guide a young girl to\nsafety. She’s a fugitive, struggling with her own emergent humanity and\nwhether she has a right to be a mother at all. It’s moving at times, but plot\ntwists I won’t spoil here demolish what could have been a touching conclusion.\nA series of stellar moments can’t save a character who stumbles through cliche\nafter cliche, without giving the player a real sense of closure.\n\nUnlike Connor, Kara’s inconsistencies can’t be saved through a thrilling\nmixture of investigations and fight scenes. Her vulnerable nature makes such\nthings a bigger obstacle, and thus she finds herself on the sidelines through\nsequences suffering from inconsistent pacing and some seriously eye-rolling\nstorytelling.\n\nOne chapter follows Kara and company as they seek shelter in an abandoned\ntheme park amidst a snowstorm. It could be pulled straight from an episode of\n_Scooby Doo_ , undermining all dramatic importance.\n\nDetroit: Become Human is filled with such jarring scenes. The most ridiculous\nof which has Connor chasing a suspect through a strip club before being jumped\non by a pair of rogue android lesbians. Yes, I’m being serious.\n\nThis is a shame, because the subject matter of Become Human is perfect for\naddressing the themes of love and sexuality, particularly in how intimate\nmatters would apply to robotic beings that strive for a meaningful existence.\n\nInstead, Quantic Dream thrusts meaningless one-off instances with a\nrecklessness that feels pointless. The aforementioned couple never make\nanother appearance, acting as a stepping stone for Connor and nothing more.\n\n**Related:**[ **E3\n2018**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/e3-2018-2949170)\n\n![Detroit Become\nHuman](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nMarkus’ story suffers the most from this hamfisted approach to\ncharacterisation. It’s the weakest of the trio, but also the most ambitious in\nthe way it aims to tackle android equivalents of civil rights, slavery and\nparallels to racism.\n\nOnce again, the player is hit over the head with these messages so directly it\nbecomes almost laughable. Moments of poignancy are reduced to predictable\nstory revelations that offer no worthwhile conclusion.\n\nIf you’re willing to overlook an occasionally clumsy, predictable narrative\nthen you’ll find a worthwhile sci-fi tale in Detroit: Become Human. Well,\nyou’ll certainly be captivated by its excellent presentation. It’s gorgeous,\nshowcasing jaw-dropping scenes across the futuristic cityscape as it’s\ndrenched in rain, snow and fog across the surprisingly long journey. Character\nmodels are just as breathtaking, providing a sense of impressive\nphotorealistic emotion.\n\nAction sequences are equally stunning, with ace choreography that player\ndecisions have a real hand in executing. Much like Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two\nSouls before it, Detroit is played with rudimentary movement controls and\nquick-time events for all commands. It’s simple and easy for anyone to pick up\nand play, although in certain instances it felt unresponsive. Having to repeat\nthe same sections because Kara or Connor started derping about made major\nmistakes feel like no fault of my own.\n\nFortunately, all chapters can be replayed through a selection screen, each of\nwhich hosts a generous number of checkpoints if you suddenly change your mind\nregarding a big event. It’s greatly implemented with the option to overwrite\npast decisions, influencing the narrative without another full playthrough.\n\n**Related:**[ **Best PS4\nGames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/ps4-games-3431751)\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**VERDICT**\n\nDetroit: Become Human is complicated. It’s a technological marvel with great\nperformances and an entertaining narrative at its core. Kara, Connor and\nMarkus are all given enough room to breathe as characters that you feel\nconnected to all of them. I cared about where their stories would end.\n\nUnfortunately, Quantic Dream oversteps its boundaries and muddles the water\nwith thematic elements that feel awkwardly handled. The player isn’t expected\nto interpret anything on their own as hamfisted messages are thrust upon them\nagain and again.\n\nIt’s hard not to feel that with a little more focus and maturity that this\ncould have been something special.\n\n## Score\n\n  \n\n"}
