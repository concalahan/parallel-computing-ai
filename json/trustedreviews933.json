For instance, the Home Hub\ndoesn’t use the scaled-down Android Things operating system and doesn’t\ninclude the Qualcomm SD624 Home Hub platform.\n\nInstead, the Home Hub runs on a version of the Google Cast software it uses\nwith its Chromecast devices and an Amlogic chip rather than the Qualcomm\nplatform, which was developed for the smart displays.\n\nSo, essentially, Google developed an operating system for these devices and\nthen decided not to use it. Why? Well, Google says it’s because developers are\nhappy using Android Things.\n\nDiya Jolly, Google‘s VP of product management, told\n[ArsTechnica](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/10/google-home-hub-under-\nthe-hood-its-nothing-like-other-google-smart-displays/): “There’s no\nparticular reason. We just felt we could bring the experience to bear with\nCast, and the experiences are the same. We would have easily given the third-\nparties Cast if they wanted it, but I think most developers are comfortable\nusing Android Things.”\n\n**Related:[Google Home Hub vs Amazon Echo\nShow](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-home-hub-vs-amazon-echo-\nshow-3602099)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nGoogle’s real reason for dropping the Android Things/Qualcomm combo could be\ndown to an effort to make the device as affordable as possible.\n\nAfter all, the Home Hub is a little less premium than some of the other smart\ndisplays out there. Ars Techica points out the Amlogic chips deployed by\nGoogle usually appear in lower-end smart TVs and media players.\n\nThe company also eschewed a web cam for making video calls and only has a\n7-inch display. The Home Hub is priced at just £139/$139, which is $50 less\nthan the next smart display up.\n\n**Will you be buying the Google Home Hub when it goes on sale on October 22?\nDrop us a line @TrustedReviews on Twitter.**\n\n"}
