Then\nagain, “currently unavailable” is very different to scrapped.\n\nReports have suggested that Apple is experiencing serious technical\nchallenges. Nobody would have expected it to be easy to develop a multi-device\nwireless charging device that can charge in any position, but overheating in\nparticular appears to have been a serious issue.\n\nThe AirPower no-show was arguably the low point of a fairly underwhelming\nevening.\n\nThe new iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max are extremely expensive and don’t\nrepresent major upgrades on the iPhone X, which Apple has now stopped selling\naltogether, and the [iPhone XR](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-xr-\nrelease-date-specs-price-3579137) is also pricier than many expected.\n\n**Read more:[iPhone XS vs Galaxy\nS9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-xs-vs-galaxy-s9-3564946)**\n\nThe only other piece of new hardware unveiled at the event was the [Apple\nWatch 4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-watch-4-specs-release-\ndate-3565562), which sadly doesn’t feature a circular screen, but does\nrepresent a big upgrade over the Apple Watch 3.\n\n**What’s your take on everything Apple launched this week?
