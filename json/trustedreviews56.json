Overall it\nfaired well, particularly thanks to its impressive performance and dual rear\ncameras.\n\n**Related:[Samsung Galaxy Note 9 vs Galaxy\nS9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-9-vs-\ngalaxy-s9-3527010)**\n\nNow it has to take on the more productivity-focused Note line, and while the\nnew Galaxy Note 9 shares plenty with its more svelte Galaxy S siblings, there\nare a few key differences that help it to take the fight to Apple.\n\nGenerally speaking, based on artificial benchmarking Apple’s latest A11 chip\ntypically fares better than the Exynos 9810 (and Qualcomm Snapdragon 845\ndestined for 2018 Galaxy flagships in the US and Asia). However, with 6GB/8GB\nof RAM to help keep things running smoothly (up to more than twice that of the\niPhone X), with real-world use the Note 9 will likely perform admirably for\nthe duration of your average two-year contract.\n\n**Related:[Best smartphones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nsmartphone-3431175)**\n\n![Samsung Galaxy Note 9 handheld office video lifestyle press\nimage](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nSamsung has done a great job of pushing its extended aspect ratio, high-\nresolution AMOLED displays to the boundaries of it top-end phones – but Apple\ntook things further in the screen-to-body ratio department with the launch of\nthe iPhone X. If you’re comfortable living that notch life, then you might\nprefer what Apple has to offer. Otherwise, the additional screen real-estate\nrenders the Note 9 the better option for productivity and media consumption.\n\nSpeaking of media, both phones support HDR viewing from supported apps, such\nas Netflix. The use of OLED panels also means you get to enjoy rich colours\nand excellent contrast whichever handset you prefer.\n\n**Related:[Samsung Galaxy Note 9 vs Galaxy S9\nPlus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-9-vs-\ngalaxy-s9-plus-3525284)**\n\nAs for the cameras, both phones pack in 12-megapixel dual sensors on the rear,\nwith the secondary sensor of each offering lossless 2x optical zoom. Apple\ntrumps Samsung with its superior 4K video-recording quality and frame rates,\nwhile Note 9 boasts 960fps super-slow motion burst recording, just as on the\nS9 and [Samsung Galaxy S9\nPlus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9-plus).\n\nOptical image stabilisation and portrait mode functionality feature on both\nphones, too, with the iPhone adding the option of virtual studio lighting and\nscenes. In response, the Note adds Snapchat Lens-style overlays for some added\nfrivolity.\n\n**Related:[Best Android phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nandroid-phones-3438996)**\n\n## Samsung Galaxy Note 9 vs iPhone X – Specs comparison\n\nSo how does the Note 9’s fundamental hardware (and software) compare to the\nmighty iPhone X:\n\n| **Galaxy Note 9** | **iPhone X**  \n---|---|---  \n**Display** |  6.4 inches, 1440 x 2960, Super AMOLED | 5.8 inches, 1125 x\n2436, OLED  \n**Processor** |  Exynos 9810/Snapdragon 845 | Apple A11 Bionic  \n**RAM** |  6GB/8GB | 3GB  \n**IP rating** |  IP68 | IP67  \n**Rear camera** |  Dual 12 megapixels | Dual 12 megapixels  \n**Front camera** |  8 megapixels | 7 megapixels  \n**Battery** |  4000mAh | 2716mAh  \n**Software** |  Android 8.1 Oreo | iOS 11  \n**Storage** |  128/512GB + microSD up to 512GB | 64/256GB. Non-expandable  \n**Stylus** |  S Pen w/ Bluetooth | None  \n**Starting price** |  £899 | £999  \n  \n## Samsung Galaxy Note 9 vs iPhone X – Design and software\n\nThese are both premium handsets. Apple’s iPhone X comes in just two shades – a\nglass-backed Space Grey and a Silver option, both feature a reflective\nsurgical-grade steel frame banding around the edge. The Note 9, meanwhile,\nwill arrive in three shades: Midnight Black, Lavender Purple and Ocean Blue\n(with a yellow S Pen).\n\nBeing an Apple device in 2018, the iPhone shrugs off the headphone jack,\nleaving just the single Lightning port for data and power – although this is\none of the first iPhones to support Qi wireless charging as well. The body of\nthe iPhone might look fragile, but Apple has also ensured that it’s IP67 dust\nand water-resistant, so you can happily use it in the bath or the rain.\n\nSamsung arguably offers some of the most premium Android-based alternatives to\nthe iPhone, and the Note 9 looks to be the biggest and best example of this\nyet. It, too, features a curved glass front and back with a metal frame in\nbetween. Unlike last year’s Galaxy S8 twins, the metal frame now comes colour-\nmatched to whichever option you choose. It supports fast charging thanks to\nthat glass design, but adheres to both the Qi and PMA standards as well as\naccommodating Samsung’s own fast wireless charging standard. There’s also\nstill a headphone jack and the whole thing is IP68 certified to boot.\n\n**Related:[Samsung Galaxy Note 9 vs Galaxy S8\nPlus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-9-vs-\ngalaxy-s8-plus-3526323)**\n\nThe iPhone’s notch doesn’t just house the front camera but also the TrueDepth\nsensor array that powers the phone’s Face ID authentication. It’s faster and\nmore secure than Samsung’s existing iris and face-recognition technologies\ncombined, but the Note also includes a fingerprint sensor under the rear\ncamera. This also supports gestures within the Android-based user experience.\n\n![iPhone\nX](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nComparing iOS to Android is always a tricky affair. The experience offered up\nby the iPhone X showcases some notable changes on the interaction front that\naren’t necessarily for the better (compared to more traditionally-shaped\niPhones). However, it also offers a consistently great app experience and,\npaired with the powerful internals, still feels fast and fluid after months of\nuse.\n\nSadly, the Note 9 doesn’t launch on the freshly named [Android 9.0\nPie](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/android-pie). Instead, it arrives\non the slightly older Android 8.1 Oreo, with its own Samsung Experience UI on\ntop. It offers a more coherent navigation structure to that of iOS on the\niPhone X and has the added benefit of all that S Pen stylus functionality.\n\n**Related:[Samsung Galaxy Note 9 vs Galaxy Note\n8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-9-vs-\nnote-8-3526974)**\n\nWhip out the S Pen and its new Bluetooth connectivity lets you remotely\ncontrol presentations while your Note is hooked up to the big screen using the\ndesktop-like DeX environment 9which no longer requires any form of dock). You\ncan remotely pause and play media with it, too. Air Command also means the S\nPen can be used to grab snippets on-screen, doodle Live Messages (which mirror\nApple’s Digital Touch feature), and translate text to or from other languages\nin real-time.\n\n## Samsung Galaxy Note 9 vs iPhone X price – Which is better value?\n\nThe iPhone X launched with a headline-grabbing £999 price tag in the UK, and\nthat’s for the smaller capacity 64GB model. Samsung’s new Note is equally\npremium but only break that same threshold in its higher-capacity form, with\nthe 128GB costing £899 and the 512GB version costing £1099.\n\n## Early Verdict\n\nAt first glance, it would seem that the Note 9 offers more bang for your buck,\nmatching the iPhone on most fronts and offering additional benefits such as\nfaster wireless charging, DeX support and the S Pen stylus. However, for some\nthe superior app experience, performance and compact power of the iPhone X\nstill make for a more compelling purchase.\n\n"}
