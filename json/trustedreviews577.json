There will be two\nmodels with full-array back light and local dimming. This means you can\nbenefit from good contrast, even if your budget doesn’t stretch to the OLEDs.\n\n3) ThinQ – LG is rolling out a new AI platform, which sits on top of the\nexisting (and excellent) webOS interface. Basically, you can now use your\nvoice to control your TV – to search Netflix, change channels, change modes,\nfind TV programmes, set a timer, for example. This will be compatible with\nGoogle Home and Amazon Echo smart speakers.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n**Related:[Best TV](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-tv)**\n\n## LG TV 2018 – 4K OLED\n\nLG was responsible for kicking off the OLED revolution, so it stands to reason\nthe company is pushing the format harder than any other manufacturer in the TV\nmarket. There are five lines of OLED models, ranging from the moderately\naffordable to the ridiculously fancy.\n\nWith the exception of the junior B8 model, all benefit from the new Alpha 9\n(A9) processor, which offers a 35% improvement on CPU and GPU performance,\nplus double the RAM. This marks a significant upgrade over the 2017 models,\nwith superior noise reduction, motion handling, depth enhancement and dynamic\ntone mapping.\n\nColour accuracy has been upgraded too. The 2018 models have 35,937 colour\npoints on the Look-Up Table, as opposed to 4913 points in 2017. Translation:\nwe’re looking at seven times the colour accuracy.\n\nThe A9 processor is also capable of handling HFR (high frame rate) video up to\n120fps. There isn’t anything similar being broadcast at the moment, but LG is\nfuture-proofing here. Gamers will be able to play in 1080p resolution with HDR\nup to 120fps – but not in 4K.\n\nAs was the case with LG’s 2017 models, the 2018 models offer the same picture\nquality on the whole. The panel, processing and picture performance remain\nsimilar across the range. The differences come by way of the design elements\nand audio performance.\n\nThe exception to this is the junior B8 model, which doesn’t include the A9\nprocessor. More on that below.\n\n**Related:[Best 4K Tvs](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-4k-tv-\ndeals-2018-3397341)**\n\n![LG W8\nOLED](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**LG W8 – 65 and 77 inches**\n\n  * LG OLED65W8 (£7,999)\n  * LG OLED77W8 (£14,999)\n\nAlso known as the Wallpaper TV, the W8 is the flagship model and the ultimate\nstatus TV in LG’s arsenal. It’s a wafer-thin screen that is mounted on your\nwall with magnets. The sound system and connections sit separately in a\nsoundbar, which attaches to the screen via a thin (and nearly invisible)\nribbon.\n\nSomewhat annoyingly, the W8 looks virtually identical in design to last year’s\nW7. The picture performance isn’t the same, however.\n\n![LG G8\nOLED](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**LG G8 – 65 inches**\n\n  * LG OLED65G8 (£5,999)\n\nThe G series OLED was LG’s original ‘Signature’ model, and was made to really\nshow off the company’s talents. As before, you get a gorgeous ‘picture on\nglass’ design, which is more flashy than the W series’ minimalist vibe.\n\nPrevious G series OLEDs featured a folding soundbase design – the soundbar\ncould be flipped down – for those wanting to wall-mount the TV. This year, the\nG8 doesn’t have the transformation element. It’s a fixed panel of glass,\ncurving down into a fixed soundbar. Lovely.\n\n![LG E8\nOLED](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**LG E8 – 55 and 65 inches**\n\n  * LG OLED55E8 (£3,499)\n  * LG OLED65E8 (£4,999)\n\nIf you like the fancy glass design, but you have no need for a soundbar, this\nis the model for you. The LG E8 focuses on the picture and the design, and is\nideal for anyone with an existing sound system.\n\nIt’s a smart move by LG – the previous generation E model came with a\nsoundbar, which made it uncomfortably similar to the soundbar-toting G model\nabove it.\n\n![LG C8\nOLED](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**LG C8 – 55, 65 and 77 inches**\n\n  * LG OLED55C8 (£2,999)\n  * LG OLED65C8 (£4,499)\n  * LG OLED77C8 (£7,999)\n\nThis is the no-frills model. There’s no shiny glass design, nor a fancy\nsoundbar. But that makes it more affordable and accessible. While the other\nmodels are great for showing off, this is the TV that gets the job done.\n\nLG clearly expects to sell this model in greater quantities. Last year’s C7,\nwith its reasonable price tag, was a huge seller – especially when the Black\nFriday sales knocked prices down to around £1500. If you’re looking for value,\nthis is the model you should keep an eye on.\n\nInterestingly, this is the first time that a ‘lower’ OLED has been available\nin a monster 77-inch option.\n\n![LG B8\nOLED](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**LG B8 – 55 and 65 inches**\n\n  * LG OLED55B8 (£2,499)\n  * LG OLED65B8 (£3,999)\n\nLast year, the B and C models were essentially the same TV with different\nstands. This year, they’re entirely different TVs, with the B8 serving as the\n‘junior’ model. It doesn’t feature the A9 processor found throughout the rest\nof the range.\n\nInstead it’s home to the A7 processor, which isn’t quite as powerful. It\ndoesn’t benefit from the A9’s level of noise reduction or colour accuracy, nor\nits HFR handling. But it does feature the A9’s Black Frame Insertion – an\neffective way to improve motion handling without the overly glossy look\nbrought on by Motion Interpolation modes.\n\n**Related:[Best soundbars](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nsoundbars)**\n\n## LG TV 2018 – 4K LED LCD models\n\nLG is definitely focusing on its 4K OLED models, but that doesn’t mean it’s\nforgotten about the more affordable LED LCD TVs, which make up its mid-range\nmodels. LG calls them the ‘Super UHD TV’ range.\n\nThese TVs use LG’s nano-cell tech to achieve better colour performance than\nstandard LED LCD TVs. They’re direct rivals to Samsung’s Quantum Dot TVs.\nWhat’s the difference? Well LG says nano-cell particles are more uniform than\nQuantum Dots, which theoretically means more accurate and consistent colours,\nespecially when viewed off-centre.\n\nThree models have been announced so far, all of which feature the A7 processor\nfound in the B8 OLED.\n\n![LG SK95](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**LG SK95 – 55 and 65 inches**\n\n  * LG 55SK950 (£1,999)\n  * LG 65SK950 (£2,699)\n\nThe SK95 sits at the top of the Super UHD TV range. The most exciting thing\nhere is that it benefits from direct backlighting, as opposed to the edge\nlighting found on most LED LCDs.\n\nIt isn’t just any backlighting, either. This set features FALD, or full array\nlocal dimming, which consistently yields the most lighting precision on these\nTVs. You won’t get OLED levels of control, but this TV will be able to handle\nsimultaneous light and dark areas better than most LED LCDs. LG says you get\n2.5 times better black levels, and 16 times the lighting control.\n\nLG wouldn’t be drawn on how many dimming zones there are, but the company did\nsay this TV is capable of between 1000 and 1500 nits of brightness.\n\n![LG SK85](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**LG SK85 – 49, 55 and 65 inches**\n\n  * LG 49SK850 (£1,299)\n  * LG 55SK850 (£1,699)\n  * LG 65SK850 (£2,499)\n\nThe SK85 is a step down from the SK95, with fewer dimming zones and lower peak\nbrightness. However, it does still benefit from direct backlighting, which\nautomatically puts it above the existing SJ850 it replaces.\n\n![LG SK80](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**LG SK80 – 55, 65 and 75 inches**\n\n  * LG 55SK800 (£1,199)\n  * LG 65SK800 (£1,499)\n  * LG 75SK800 (£2,199)\n\nThis is the no-frills option. It’s still a nano-cell model but we lose the\nbacklighting. This is an edge-lit model, so contrast is lacking compared to\nthe FALD models. If you want quantity over quality, you’re in luck – this\nmodel is available at 75 inches.\n\nThat’s everything LG has announced so far, but I expect there will be more\naffordable LED LCD models, both in 4K and Full HD resolution.
