Pie\n\n## What is the Sony Xperia XZ3?\n\nWhen it comes to its smartphones division, you couldn’t accuse Sony of resting\non its laurels. Certainly, the company launches new phones more often than\nsome people have hot dinners.\n\nThe Xperia XZ3 follows hot on the heels of the [Sony Xperia\nXZ2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sony-xperia-xz2), giving Sony a\nsecond stab at going up against the likes of the [Samsung Galaxy\nS9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9) and [Huawei\nP20](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/huawei-p20). It’s also\nconveniently timed ahead of the forthcoming [Google Pixel\n3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-pixel-3-release-date-\nprice-3316812).\n\nLike the Xperia XZ2, the XZ3 shows that Sony has truly moved on in terms of\ndesign. Thanks to a gorgeous new OLED display, a more modern design and top\nspecifications, Sony finally feels like it has a fitting flagship. It isn’t\nquite ready to usurp its rivals but it’s a big step in the right direction –\neven if, ultimately, it isn’t that exciting.\n\n## Sony Xperia XZ3 – Design\n\nUntil earlier in 2018, Sony had been clinging onto its OmniBalance design\nlanguage – with its acute angles and sharp edges – for approaching half a\ndecade. That’s practically a lifetime when it comes to tech. Just compare an\n[iPhone 5](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/apple-iphone-5) to anything\nyou see today and you get an impression of how quickly tastes change.\n\nThankfully, it appears that Sony is finally ready to move on. The Xperia XZ3\nfeels like a much more modern phone, although it still isn’t quite up to date.\nIts design has strong parallels with last year’s [Google Pixel\n2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-2) and the [Samsung\nGalaxy S8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s8).\n\n**Related:[Best smartphones 2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nsmartphone-3431175)**\n\n![Sony Xperia XZ3\nhomescreen](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n###  Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nI mention the Galaxy S8, and not the newer Galaxy S9, because the S9 has\nreduced those top and bottom bezels. Placed next to smartphones such as the\n[OnePlus 6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/oneplus-6), it’s in this\nregard that the Xperia XZ3 can still look a little dated.\n\nSlightly thick top and bottom bezels aside, the much higher screen-to-body\nratio does help make the XZ3 feel like a more modern phone. It remains svelte,\nwhich is a huge positive considering the unwieldy heft of the [Sony Xperia XZ2\nPremium](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sony-xperia-xz2-premium).\n\nThis is a handset that’s covered in Gorilla Glass 5, both front and back, and\nheld together with a tough aluminium rim. It feels well made, but all that\nglass does make it a little slippery in the hand.\n\nFlip the phone around and one of my biggest grievances becomes apparent. The\nfingerprint scanner is awkwardly placed, smack in the centre of the rear.\n\n![Sony Xperia\nXZ3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nGrabbing the phone for the first time, it’s likely that the majority of people\nwill find they naturally assume the camera is, in fact, the fingerprint\nscanner. With the scanner so low down, you have to hold the phone lower, which\nis awkward\n\nThe scanner is level with the power button on the right, which I’ll also argue\nis also placed in an unnatural position.\n\nAll of the phone’s buttons sit along the right edge, which leaves it feeling a\nlittle busy and unbalanced. The top half houses a volume rocker, the\naforementioned power button sits in the middle, then towards the bottom,\nthere’s a dedicated shutter button for the camera.\n\n![Sony Xperia\nXZ3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe shutter button can be half-pressed for focusing as it is on a fully\nfledged camera, and adds good tactility for snaps. However, I wish the button\nhadn’t been physically identical to the power button.\n\nLike the XZ2 Premium, the headphone jack has been omitted, but you do get a\nUSB-C to 3.5mm adapter included in the box. The XZ3 supports LDAC over\nBluetooth for better quality, so audiophiles might not be quite as perturbed\nif they have compatible headphones (most models are from Sony).\n\nSony has bundled in its Dynamic Vibration System again here, and I actually\nquite like it. It’s definitely gimmicky, but also kind of fun. It ramps up the\nhaptic vibration in line with the audio you have playing for some extra\nsensory feedback.\n\nActually, it’s a shame the feature only works with the screen on. I can\nimagine it would be battery-wasting fun to have it in your pocket while you\nlisten to music, almost like the trance vibrator packs for anyone who\nremembers the video game Rez. If you’re going to do something as gimmicky as\nthis, Sony, you may as well go all in.\n\n![Sony Xperia\nXZ3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe screen is flanked by stereo speakers integrated into the bezel, and these\nproduce a decent amount of volume. A little bit of Dynamic Vibration does\nactually help round out the low-end when watching films. Fortunately, you can\nchoose the level of Dynamic Vibration you want; add in too much and you’ll\nprobably find it a distraction.\n\n## Sony Xperia XZ3 – Display\n\nThe display in the XZ3 has come on leaps and bounds from previous Sony\nflagships, due in no small part to the move from LCD to OLED technology. The\n6-inch, QHD+ (1440 x 2880) OLED panel is fantastic to look at. The blacks are\nas deep as you’d expect and colours are much richer than previous Sony\nefforts.\n\nSony has supposedly used the same X Reality Pro engine from its Bravia line of\nTVs, and its efforts have paid off. The display supports HDR, so compatible\ncontent looks great. Brightness levels are great, too, so the screen is easy\nto see outdoors, and offers decent viewing angles overall.\n\nThere’s an ambient display mode that can show notifications and the time\npermanently, when you pick up the phone, or when you double-tap the screen.\nThere’s also a nifty photo playback mode for the ambient display that shows\noff some of your photos.\n\nThe edge of the display now curves around the sides slightly. Sony makes use\nof this with ‘Side Sense’; double-tap the side of the screen to bring up a\nmenu with shortcuts to apps, settings and notifications.\n\n![Sony Xperia\nXZ3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIt’s a feature I could see myself using. However, getting it to work proved\nfrustrating, requiring me to hold the device in a very specific way. I’m not\nsure that it can handle multiple parts of your hand touching the screen at the\nsame time, which is practically impossible to avoid.\n\nIt’s a shame because it’s difficult to reach the notification shade on such a\nlarge phone one-handed. On other phones – Huawei or OnePlus models, for\nexample – I’ve become used to a swipe down on the rear fingerprint sensor, but\nthat isn’t an option here. Instead, there’s a notification shortcut buried in\nthe Side Sense menu.\n\nYou’re also able to swipe down the edge of the display as a ‘Back’ shortcut,\nbut I kept triggering this by accident. I ended up having to disable Side\nSense altogether after a week of attempting to get to grips with it.\n\n##  **Sony Xperia XZ3** – Performance\n\n**Screen** |  6-inch, QHD+ OLED w/ HDR  \n---|---  \n**Performance** |  Snapdragon 845  \n**RAM** |  4GB  \n**Storage** |  64GB + microSD  \n**Rear camera** |  19MP, _f/_ 2.0 with 4K HDR recording  \n**Front camera** |  13MP, _f/_ 1.9  \n**B** **attery** |  3300mAh, fast charge, wireless charging  \n**Software** |  Android 9 Pie  \n  \nWhen it comes to specifications for a flagship smartphone in 2018, the XZ3\nchecks pretty much all the boxes. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 is the same\nsystem-on-chip seen in handsets from the OnePlus 6, Samsung Galaxy S9\n(dependent on territory), [LG\nG7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/lg-g7), and Sony’s earlier 2018\nXperia XZ2. It’s still a plenty powerful chip.\n\nPerhaps the only shortcoming is the 4GB of RAM, which pales against the\nOnePlus 6 – but then the Galaxy S9 similarly makes do with 4GB. It isn’t\nsomething that will impact day-to-day performance. The standard 64GB of\nstorage is expandable through microSD too, which is welcome.\n\nFrom the below comparison table, you can see the Xperia XZ3 acquits itself\nwell against its rivals:\n\n| **Single-Core** | **Multi-Core** | **AnTuTu 7**  \n---|---|---|---  \n**OnePlus 6** |  2124 | 9045 | 267,001  \n**Huawei P20 Pro** |  1921  | 6837  | 209,658  \n**Huawei Mate 10 Pro** |  1906  | 6740  | 178,091  \n**Galaxy S9 Plus** |  3720 | 8890 | 251,205  \n**iPhone X** |  4257 | 10,364  | 235,607  \n**Pixel 2** |  1917 | 6312 | 184,336  \n**Xperia XZ3** |  3447 | 7669 | 255,187  \n  \nI didn’t encounter any stutters hopping between apps. Oddly, the only minor\nhiccup involved bringing up the keyboard when tapping on a text field in\ncertain apps such as WhatsApp. There’s a momentary stutter, which might well\njust be a bug.\n\nSimilarly, games run without a hitch. Frame rates in PUBG and Asphalt 9 were\nsilky smooth.\n\n##  **Sony Xperia XZ3** – Software\n\nThe Xperia XZ3 comes with Android 9 Pie out of the box, which is a step up\nfrom the Xperia XZ2. However, some of the Android updates seen in Pie for\nother phones – such as Google’s Pixel 2 – are absent. For example, there’s no\nsign of the new gesture controls.\n\nThe continued frustration of pre-installed apps remains with inclusions like\nBooking.com, Kobo, AVG anti-virus and Amazon apps. In addition to these are\nSony’s suite of apps, most of which you probably won’t care for. There are\ngimmicky options such as AR Effect and 3D Creator, and Xperia Lounge – whose\npurpose appears to be simply to serve you Sony-related adverts. Note, too,\nthat it may not be possible to uninstall some of these apps; you might only be\nable to disable them.\n\n![Sony Xperia\nXZ3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIt’s not all bad news on the software front, however. Sony has added handy\nfeatures such as a Glove mode option, which will be handy for prodding away at\nthe touchscreen when the weather turns colder.\n\nThen there’s the Photo Playback option for the ambient display. This can pull\nin photos from your camera roll to show when the phone is in standby; these\ncan be geolocated so you get photos taken from your current location. At home,\nthis meant being greeted by photos of our cats; in the office, it meant seeing\nthe face of _Trusted’s_ mobiles editor, [Max\nParker](https://www.trustedreviews.com/author/max-parker), and photos of my\nlunch.\n\nAnd of course, there’s the aforementioned Side Sense – which, unfortunately,\ndoesn’t work very well.\n\n##  **Sony Xperia XZ3** – Camera\n\nWhile the Xperia XZ2 Premium introduced a dual-camera setup, it’s back to just\na solo snapper for the XZ3, which is a tad disappointing. It has a\n19-megapixel sensor paired with a _f/_ 2.0 aperture lens. The Xperia XZ2\nPremium not only has two lenses, but both have larger apertures than the\nsingle option here.\n\n![Sony Xperia XZ3 in\nhand](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIn general, the Xperia XZ3’s camera is fine – but it never particularly\nimpresses. It has a habit of adding too much contrast to photos, making them\nlook unrealistic and overly processed. Under trickier lighting conditions –\nwhen the sun is relatively low in the sky, for example – it has a tendency to\nover-expose shots, too. Low-light performance isn’t bad, although not as\nstrong as the likes of the Google Pixel 2 or Samsung Galaxy S9.\n\nAlso included is a faux-bokeh mode, where the camera uses software to try to\nsimulate a shallow depth of field, but it can get things quite wrong. That’s\nwhere a second camera sensor would have been useful for calculating depth. The\ncamera app can also be a tad slow, and the auto-focus can hunt and struggle to\nget a lock as fast as I’d like.\n\nOtherwise, the Xperia XZ3 delivers generally acceptable photos the majority of\nthe time. They’re just nothing special.\n\n![Sony Xperia\nXZ3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSome low-light shots can end up looking a little washed out.\n\n![Sony Xperia\nXZ3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe camera can capture decent levels of detail.\n\n![Sony Xperia\nXZ3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nColours are generally rich.\n\n![Sony Xperia\nXZ3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSome trickier scenes can end up overexposed.\n\n![Sony Xperia\nXZ3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nLow-light shots retain good detail with acceptable noise.\n\n![Sony Xperia\nXZ3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThere’s a predictive capture mode, where you can pick the best shot from a\nbatch.\n\n![Sony Xperia\nXZ3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSome shadow detail can get lost.\n\nSony has also added some automatic gesture recognition into the camera app.\nRaise the phone up, as if you’re about to take a photo, and it will\nautomatically offer up the option of the camera app. It works semi-reliably,\nbut, more often than not, I found myself resorting to the shutter button to\nlaunch the camera.\n\nThe XZ3 can shoot 4K HDR video, and it can also now manage 960fps super slow-\nmotion video at 1080p.\n\n##  **Sony Xperia XZ3** – Battery life\n\nThe 3300mAh battery isn’t the biggest unit but paired with the more power-\nefficient OLED panel and the Xperia XZ3’s stamina, it’s pretty respectable.\nWith standard use – which for me included lots of social media, some Spotify\nstreaming, and listening to podcasts – I could take the phone off charge in\nthe morning at 7:30am and still have around 20% remaining by 10pm.\n\nI experimented with having the ambient display mode turned on permanently,\nwith photo playback enabled. I found that under generally the same conditions,\nI’d end up with around 15% battery by 10pm.\n\nWatch HDR content on Netflix at around half brightness and you’ll see a drop\nof around 10-12% an hour, which isn’t too bad.\n\nThe good news is that the Xperia XZ3 supports Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 for\nfast charging, and that glass back panel also means that Qi wireless charging\ncapability is included, too.\n\n## Why buy the Sony Xperia XZ3?\n\n![Sony Xperia\nXZ3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nUltimately, the Sony Xperia XZ3 is a competent flagship phone. It’s just a\nlittle difficult to feel particularly excited by it.\n\nIt certainly gets plenty right, helping to bring Sony in line with its rivals.\nPlus, the move to OLED is a positive one.\n\nHowever, the device feels dated already. Ultimately, the Xperia XZ3 does\nlittle to really stand out from the crowd. On one side you have the likes of\nthe OnePlus 6, which delivers similar performance and an arguably more\nattractive design for less. On the other is the Huawei P20/P20 Pro and Samsung\nGalaxy S9, phones that innovate more around their cameras.\n\n## Verdict\n\nA big step in the right direction for Sony flagships.\n\n## Score\n\n  \n\n"}
