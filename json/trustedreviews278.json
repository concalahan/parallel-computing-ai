But I just think in terms of mobility and freedom andpeople’s ability to move,” the Ford lead tells us. “I think it certainly wouldbe overwhelming to say you must now only be driven, you can never driveyourself.”(apester:569795558089e8dd05d295f8)**Related:[Apple Car](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-car-news-rumours-driverless-price-release-date-electric)**However, he suggests a system whereby the actual driving of vehicles mightonly be done in designated areas.“Do I see a day potentially where driving becomes like horseback riding?Potentially so. And might that be done in limited areas? Potentially so,”Butler tells us. “Might we see a scenario where similar to what’s happening ina lot of major cities, like London, for instance, we have restrictions on thetype of driving that you can do, and where you can drive at particular pointsin the day?

I really can’t see thathappening, but maybe that’s just because I’m a passionate driver myself.”What do you make of Don Butler’s comments? Let us know below."}
