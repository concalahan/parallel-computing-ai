There’s also a camera above the\ndisplay.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n**Related:[CES 2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ces-2018-live-news-\nhighlights-3350586)**\n\nNot a lot is known about the specs, but Google has confirmed the smart display\nwill run on the Qualcomm SD624 Home Hub platform.\n\nSony is also working on a smart display with Google Assistant integration, but\nwe’ve yet to see that model in the flesh.\n\nAway from the touchscreen solutions, Altec Lansing, Anker, Bang & Olufsen,\nBraven, iHome, JBL, Jensen, LG, Klipsch, Knit Audio, Memorex, Riva Audio and\nSōLIS are all building audio accessories with the Google Assistant at their\nheart.\n\nMeanwhile Jaybird, JBL, LG and Sony are working on Assistant-powered\nheadphones.\n\nGoogle also announced Assistant for Android Auto at CES, while Kia has pledged\nto build the tool directly into some of its vehicles.\n\n**Has the Google Assistant dominated CES 2018?
