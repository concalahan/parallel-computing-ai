Speaking at the North American International Car\nShow in Detroit, Chris Urmson, the man in charge of Google’s self-driving jam\njars, dismissed concerns about regulatory issues, saying the onus is on\ndevelopers to handle safety issues and change public perception.\n\n“We don’t think there is a regulatory block,” he said, [The Wall Street\nJournal](http://www.wsj.com/articles/google-sees-self-drive-car-on-road-\nwithin-five-years-1421267677) reports. He added the worst thing Google could\ndo was “surprise” the US regulators that it’s working with.\n\nThis isn’t hyperbole. The prototypes are being developed and assembled right\nnow, and will undergo further testing in the spring, the [Detroit Free\nPress](http://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/detroit-auto-\nshow/2015/01/14/google-car/21759099/) reports.\n\nUrmson pointed to the fact that driverless cars are already legal in some\nstates including Nevada, Florida, Washington DC, California and Michigan. He\nthinks many will follow Georgia’s example, and decide they don’t need to amend\ntheir law to allow autonomous cars.\n\nThe cost of the vehicles is another hurdle. Urmson said currently, the radars\nand lasers required to sense what’s around the car cost around $75,000, though\nthat will come down.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n**Read more:** [Toyota teams up with Oculus Rift for VR driving\nlessons](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/toyota-teams-up-with-oculus-for-\nvr-driving-lessons)\n\nGoogle isn’t going it alone. It’s been in talks with the big boys of the motor\nindustry, including General Motors and Fiat Chrysler. It takes a similar\napproach to its hardware, outsourcing production of its Nexus phones and\ntablets to manufacturers like LG and HTC.\n\nNexus car, anyone?\n\nOur very own [Milton Keynes is set to get driverless cars this\nyear](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/driverless-cars-coming-to-milton-\nkeynes-by-2015), though they’ll travel a set route rather than ferry you\nanywhere you want.
