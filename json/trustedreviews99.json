Here’s the latest on the Rift 2, including rumoured features and\nrelease date.\n\nThe prospect of an Oculus Rift 2, a direct sequel to the original headset, was\nthrown into doubt by the [departure of Oculus co-founder Brendan\nIribe](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/oculus-co-founder-quits-\nfacebook-3609365) in mid-October 2018.\n\nSome reports claimed the departure was the result of the cancellation of the\nRift 2, as Facebook focused on the growth of mainstream VR rather than on\nhigh-end experiences to push the medium’s potential.\n\nRift 2 cancelled? That was the first we’d heard of it. As recently as Oculus\nConnect 5 developer conference in late September, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg\nwas on record talking about “the next version of Rift.” Prior to that, the\n“Half Dome” prototype with varifocal displays and a 140-degree field of view\nwas previewed by Facebook at its F8 developer convince in May 2018.\n\n**Related:[Oculus Rift review](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/oculus-\nrift)**\n\nSo what gives? Well, it appears reports of the Rift 2’s demise – in light of\nthe [Oculus Go](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/oculus-go) and the\nforthcoming standalone Quest headset – may have off base. Facebook quickly\nsought to shoot down the report on October 22 and has since provided _Trusted\nReviews_ with a statement on its plans for the Rift 2.\n\nIn the statement, a Facebook spokesperson said while the company isn’t ready\nto unveil its plans for the Rift 2, it is definitely still happening. The\ncompany said there’ll be more news on the product in 2019.\n\nIt reads: “We are planning a future version of Rift. You may remember Mark\n[Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg] saying this at OC5: “… when we release the next\nversion of Rift — which isn’t this year — all of the content that works for\nRift will also work on the next version.” So while we aren’t quite ready to\ntalk about the next version of Rift, PC VR is still a category we are\ninvesting in.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Oculus Rift](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Oculus Rift 2: New report says ‘Rift S’ could be a pretty modest update\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/oculus-rift-2-release-date-3609895\n\"Oculus Rift 2: New report says ‘Rift S’ could be a pretty modest update\")\n\n  * [ ![Starship](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### When it comes to robot parcel delivery, San Fran is eating Milton Keynes’\ndust\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/starship-robot-parcel-delivery-\nuk-3613614 \"When it comes to robot parcel delivery, San Fran is eating Milton\nKeynes’ dust\")\n\n  *   * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### How to create a haunted smart Halloween home\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/create-haunted-smart-halloween-\nhome-3613611 \"How to create a haunted smart Halloween home\")\n\n  * \n\n“It’s still a part of our strategy – we’re continuing work across product and\ncontent and you’ll see this manifest next year. Additionally, Nate [Oculus co-\nfounder Nate Mitchell] continues to lead the Rift/PC team and there are no\nchanges there.”\n\nThere are two possibilities here: The first is that the Rift is going ahead as\nplanned with a true successor that pushes the envelope for high-end VR. The\nother scenario, and perhaps the most likely, is that the true Rift 2 has been\nscrapped in favour a less expansive update. That might also explain Iribe’s\nreported reason for fleeing Facebook.\n\n> Plans to build a PC headset further down the line is a different\nclarification than them shelving plans for a productized \"Rift 2\" headset.\nThere may be future PC headset with the Rift name, but the next-generation\nthat was being planned has been cancelled. <https://t.co/9MILJIoyc8>\n\n>\n\n> — Lucas Matney (@lucasmtny) [October 22,\n2018](https://twitter.com/lucasmtny/status/1054447200078573568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n**Related:[Best Oculus Rift games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\noculus-rift-games)**\n\n## Oculus ‘Rift S’ tipped as modest update to original\n\nTechCrunch, which initially reported the Rift 2 had been “cancelled” is\nstanding by its story, [as of October\n31](https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/31/after-canceling-rift-2-overhaul-oculus-\nplans-a-modest-update-to-flagship-vr-headset/). A new report says the Rift 2\nwould have been a “complete redesign” codenamed “Caspar”. That’s no more, the\nsources say, with Facebook now planning more of a refinement to the original\nRift.\n\nThe new model might even be called the “Rift S” according to the report, and\nwe know from covering iPhones forever, that adding the letter S, generally\nmeans an iterative update rather than a great shake up.\n\nThe key change, according to the report could be the addition of the Insight\n“inside-out” tracking system, which is central to the functionality of the\nforthcoming standalone Oculus Quest headset. That would replace the\n“Constellation” tracking system on the original Rift. Worryingly, the report\npoints out:\n\n> “While the Insight system would likely offer users a much more simplified\nsetup process, a clear pain point of the first-generation product, “inside-\nout” tracking systems have greater limitations when it comes to the lighting\nconditions they work in and are generally less accurate than systems with\nexternal trackers.”\n\nElsewhere we could see higher resolution lenses on the next Rift headset, the\nreport says.\n\n## Oculus Rift 2 features\n\nSo far there’s been plenty to help us piece together what an Oculus Rift 2\nheadset might look like. We can rest assured the system will require a\nrelatively powerful PC in order to handle the high-end VR workload, while a\nmachine running Windows 10 is also likely to be a staple.\n\nMany VR fans will hope the Rift 2 will free them from cables with a wireless\nheadset or an adapter acting as a go-between for the Rift and the accompanying\nPC. We can also expect next generation processors powering the experience.\n\nThe Half Dome prototype showcased in May previewed potential new features like\na wider 140-degree field of view, moving varifocal displays, as well as hand\nand eye tracking.\n\nIt appears the Rift 2 could also benefit from advanced hand and even finger\ntracking in the virtual reality environment. Last year in a Facebook post,\nZuckerberg revealed new gloves were in testing that would enable users to type\non a virtual keyboard or shoot webs like Spider-Man.\n\nHe wrote: “We’re working on new ways to bring your hands in virtual and\naugmented reality. Wearing these gloves, you can draw, type on a virtual\nkeyboard, and even shoot webs like Spider Man. That’s what I’m doing here.”\n\nThe next-gen Rift could also benefit from eye-tracking technology, meaning\nusers would no longer have to physically turn their head in order to explore a\nVR space.\n\n## Oculus Rift 2 price and release date\n\nFacebook says there are plans to update users on the PC VR strategy next year.\nIt’s unclear whether that will see the launch and release of the second-\ngeneration Rift. In terms of price, we’d hope the company doesn’t raise the\ncost much beyond the current $399/£399 it costs to grab the headset.\n\n**Do you think there’ll be an Oculus Rift 2?
