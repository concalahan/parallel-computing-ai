Credit: WinFuture.de\n\n**Dell may be working on a two-screened Windows 10 device running the\nunreleased Snapdragon 850 processor, judging by a recent leak.**\n\n[WinFuture.de](http://winfuture.de/news,103460.html) has unturned information\nsuggesting an oft-touted Surface Phone could actually be made by Dell and\narrive in a difference guise than expected.\n\nThe Windows 10 on ARM device revealed by the report is codenamed Januss and\nhas apparently been in development since the summer of 2017 . The codename\ncould pretty significant in this incidence given Janus was a Roman god of\nbeginnings, who had two faces.\n\n**Related:[Windows 10\nreview](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/windows-10) **\n\n### Form factor\n\nHowever, the information discovered from within Dell offers no true indication\nof the form factor this curious device might take.\n\n[Microsoft’s Andromeda project](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/microsoft-\nandromeda-folding-tablet-3317880) speaks of foldable, hinged device with a up\nto three screens (including one on the outside for use when the device is\nfolded) and telephony capabilities. It appears Dell’s work here might be based\naround that concept.\n\nAccording to WinFuture it appears Dell has its contract manufacturer Compal\nworking on the hardware, which has a compass, accelerometer and gyroscope.\nThat suggests it’s designed to be used as a phone or tablet rather than a\nnotebook. The report also shows evidence of a built-in LTE modem, so users are\nalways connected.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nLenovo, ASUS and HP have all readied Window 10 on ARM devices running the\nSnapdragon 845 processor, but Dell’s effort could be the first to arrive on\nthe as-yet-unnannounced Snapdragon 850 SoC.\n\nThat mid-cycle update is supposed to be a souped up 845 clocked to 3.0 GHz,\naccording to recent rumblings, but Qualcomm is yet to make it official.\n\nWhether Dell’s mysterious will make it past the concept stage and emerge on\nthe market is still unclear.\n\n**Is this a device you’d be interested in?
