The12-megapixel sensor now has a clever mechanical aperture shift that will movebetween f/2.4 and f/1.5, depending on your environment.When it’s bright and sunny it will utilise the f/2.4 aperture, with the widerf/1.5 kicking in when things get darker or you’re inside. This should resultin fantastic shots during the day, but equally impressive ones in the tougherconditions that most smartphone cameras would struggle in. The S8 did have a12-megapixel sensor, but the aperture was a fixed f/1.7.4K video can now be shot at 60fps, rather than just 30fps, and slow-motion canbe cranked all the way up to 960fps for a very short time. Like the S8, the S9can also shoot in 120fps and 240fps in 1080p.Bixby, Samsung’s virtual assistant, is available on both phones and can beaccessed via a dedicated button.## **Samsung Galaxy S9 vs S8 price – Which is better value?**Prices for the Samsung Galaxy S9 start from £739 for the 64GB model.
