Brian Cox and\nEmile Hirsch are a father and son coroner duo attempting to uncover the\nsecrets surrounding a woman who has arrived on their slab in odd\ncircumstances.\n\nIt’s not ruining anything to say she’s no ordinary corpse but this is nails in\npalms levels of tense as the truth behind Jane Doe is gradually revealed with\nevery precise incision. It’s not for the faint of heart but this is essential\nhorror viewing.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Lethal League Blaze\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/lethal-league-blaze \"Lethal League\nBlaze\")\n\n  * [ ![FlexPai](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### The Royole FlexPai is the world’s first foldable phone you can actually\nbuy\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/royole-flexpai-foldable-phone-3613773\n\"The Royole FlexPai is the world’s first foldable phone you can actually buy\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Blizzcon 2018](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### BlizzCon 2018: All you need to know before this weekend’s huge convention\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/blizzcon-2018-news-dates-virtual-ticket-\ngoody-bag-schedule-3603422 \"BlizzCon 2018: All you need to know before this\nweekend’s huge convention\")\n\n  * \n\n## 2) The Rezort – 2015\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nLet’s play the good news, bad news game. The good news is that humans have\nsomehow survived the zombie apocalypse. Yay. The bad news is that the only\nundead that are left are kept on an island and hunted for sport by the\nexceptionally rich. Oh\n\nThe Rezort might be a shameless mash up of Jurassic Park and Dawn of the Dead\nbut that doesn’t make it any less of a joyously trashy brains-splattered romp.\nAn excellent collection of irritating characters are here for your bloody\ndismemberment pleasure, and Dougray Scott growls his way happily through the\nwhole thing. Throw in a Romero-esque political undertone and The Rezort is an\nunsung zombie gem.\n\n## 3) The Invitation – 2015\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIt’s probably just good life advice but maybe don’t go to a dinner party with\nyour ex wife and her new partner if you think they might be part of a creepy\ncult. Sadly Will, played by Tom Hardy lookalike Logan Marshall Green doesn’t\nheed this particular instruction, joins the festivities and starts to get\nsuspicious of the hosts’ intentions. Is is just to serve up the best risotto,\nor is there something more sinister afoot? The paranoia here is real and\nyou’ll question every action of every guest as they settle down to their meal.\nTwisty in all the right ways and constantly surprising, The Invitation is\nexceptionally tense viewing.\n\n## 4) Hush – 2016\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nHome invasion movies are a very specific brand of horror and one that,\nunderstandably, just aren’t a comfortable watch. Hush, then is the home\ninvasion movie for people who normally can’t watch them. Directed by Mike\nFlanagan, the man responsible for the excellent Haunting of Hill House (also\non Netflix), this tense thriller follows Maddie, a deaf author who lives alone\nin the woods. Yep, it’s just as dangerous as it sounds.\n\nIn true horror style, a masked murderer arrives to make her life hell, but\nthis is no gory torture porn escapade. What follows is a nail biting game of\ncat and mouse as despite not being able to speak or hear, Maddie fights back.\nJust like this year’s A Quiet Place, Flanagan uses sound in ways that mean you\njust won’t be able to sit still.\n\n## 5) The Cabin in the Woods – 2011\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nHorror comedy doesn’t get much better than what happens when Buffy the Vampire\nSlayer’s Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon combine creative powers once again like\nthe Avengers of smart scares. You know the set up here or, at least, you’ll\nthink you do.\n\nA crew of very attractive young people – oh hello, Chris Hemsworth – all head\naway from the big city to spend the weekend in a, well, cabin in the woods.\nUnsurprisingly, things go very wrong indeed but the horror that ensues isn’t\nquite what you expect. No spoilers but a razor sharp script, and knowledge of\nevery teen horror trope in the bloodied book ensures that The Cabin in the\nWoods is hilarious gory fun.\n\nPlus, for bonus viscera-covered horror comedy, you could do a lot worse than\nTucker and Dale Vs Evil, also on Netflix.\n\n## 6) Creep – 2014\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe less you know about Creep, the better but it’s a great reason not to\nanswer online adverts looking for filmmakers. This isn’t found footage in the\nstyle of The Blair Witch Project or Rec, there’s nothing supernatural at work\nhere but that makes it all the more terrifying when Aaron accepts the job of\nfilming the messages of a dying man, Josef, and things don’t go quite\naccording to plan.\n\nith a truly disturbing performance by Mark Duplass as Josef, Creep is a dark\nand hilarious descent into madness. Want more? The good news is that the\nequally unnervingly funny Creep 2 is waiting on Netflix for you too. That’s\ntwo for the price of one. You’re welcome.\n\n## 7) Under the Shadow – 2016\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nHorror does not exist in a vacuum. Quite the opposite. Movies like Dawn of the\nDead tackle consumerism, The Babadook the pain of grief and the demons of\nmental illness, and, more recently, Get Out with the racial politics of modern\nAmerica.\n\nAnd now, there’s Under the Shadow, which sees a young mother tackle the djinn\nspirits haunting her and her daughter amidst 1980s Tehran. The deft weaving of\nthe supernatural and the oppression of Sharia law is an impressive feat, and\nwhile this is a great ghost story alone, it’s a stark and moving depiction of\nlife in Iran.\n\n## 8) Don’t Breathe – 2016\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \nSurely a bunch of young criminals deserve what they get when they break into\nthe house of a blind man who apparently doesn’t trust banks and is hoarding\ncash? Surely, no matter what awaits inside, what they are doing is wrong and\nthey should suffer the consequences? Well it’s time to test your morals with\nthis gloriously nasty thriller from Evil Dead remake director Fede Alvarez. T\n\nhere’s some tonal handbrake turns throughout and you might not be ready for\nsome reveals but the tension as the apparently harmless old man turns the\ntables is gloriously fraught. One sequence in the pitch black basement of the\nhouse is truly terrifying and yes, a perfect reason to be afraid of the dark.\n\n## 9) Triangle – 2009\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThis floating horror starring Melissa George never quite gets the credit it\nshould so here we are making sure you watch it this Halloween. Like most scary\nmovies, the less you know, the more you’ll enjoy the surreal nasty at work\nhere but just know that it’s not all plain sailing when a group of friends\nhead out on a yacht. After a storm capsizes their boat, the group boards a\npassing ocean liner which is somehow deserted. This is a ghost ship that holds\nplenty of secrets and serious horror.\n\nDon’t Google, just head on in and prepare for an enjoyably twisted narrative\nand some nasty death to boot.\n\n## 10) Insidious – 2010\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThere’s been three Insidious’ – Insidiousi? – movies and a veritable universe\nof Conjuring films since, but that doesn’t mean James Wan’s original jump-\nscare-packed horror has lost any of of its potency. The relentless haunting of\nthe Lambert family – led by an excellent Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne – is\nstill great exercise for your goosebumps as a disturbing force attempts to\nseize the soul of their son.\n\nSure, it cranks from clever creeps and scares into less subtle sheer ghost\ntrain ridiculousness by the end, but there’s plenty of nightmarish imagery to\nkeep you suitably disturbed after the credits roll.\n\n**Read more:[Black Friday deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-\nblack-friday-2018-deals-2952384)**\n\n**Share your favourite Halloween horror movies with us on Twitter\n@TrustedReviews.**\n\n"}
