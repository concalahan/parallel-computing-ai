And it looks like the Japanese electronics giant could have\neven bigger things in store for[MWC\n2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/mwc-2018-news-rumours-dates-preview-\nbarcelona-3372243).**\n\nFor as long as we can remember, Sony has made a habit out of rendering the\nfingerprint reader useless on its smartphones in the United States, making\nthem an unpopular choice amongst consumers in the region – but its latest mid-\nto-high-end offerings – the listed above) seem to mark a much-needed turning\npoint.\n\nAnnounced at [CES 2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ces-2018-best-\nhighlights-news-3350586) on January 8, the Xperia XA2 and Xperia XA2 Ultra\nfeature a 5.2-inch and 6-inch Full HD screen, respectively. They also ship\nwith a Snapdragon 630 processor, instead of MediaTek Helio chipsets like their\npredecessors, and bundle 4GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage at the lowest\nconfiguration.\n\nThese upgraded specs, for our UK readers, are probably the trio’s biggest\nselling point compared to previous models.\n\nThe Xperia L2, on the other hand, was designed to bridge the size gap between\nthe Xperia XA2 and Xperia XA2 Ultra. It ships with the same 5.5-inch 720p\ndisplay as its predecessor, the [Xperia\nL1](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sony-xperia-l1), though it’s been\ntreated to an upgrade in RAM and storage – 3GB and 32GB – as well as an\nimproved (on paper) 8-megapixel selfie camera.\n\n**Related:[Xperia XZ Premium 2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/sonys-\nxperia-xz-premium-2-release-date-price-specs-rumours-uk-3347992)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Xperia XA2 and Xperia XA2 Ultra**\n\nAll three smartphones will go on sale in the UK and US by the end of February\n2018, with pricing still a mystery. That said, if they’re appraised the same\nway as their precursors, the Xperia L2 will be priced at around £170 ($200),\nthe XA2 at approximately £220 ($270) and the XA2 Ultra at roughly £300 ($370).\n\n## New Xperia Phones 2018: What’s next?\n\nA new flagship, if the rumour mill is anything to go by.\n\nAt MWC, we’re expecting see Sony debut the [Xperia XZ\nPro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/sony-xperia-xz-pro-release-date-\nprice-design-specs-leak-3373728), which fans of the Xperia line can think of\nas the XZ2 Premium.\n\nGossip is still a bit thin on the ground at the moment, but many of us are\nexpecting to see a significant redesign, with the XZ Pro getting a 5.7-inch 4K\nOLED screen with an 18:9 aspect ratio. Internals are sure to be boosted, as\nwell, with the device likely to pack a [Snapdragon\n835](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/snapdragon-835-phones-processor-\nspecs-speed-benchmark-chipset-cores-2944086) SoC – though some say a leap the\n[Snapdragon 845](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/snapdragon-845-release-\ndate-phones-specs-features-benchmarks-news-rumours-2948107) could be on the\ncards.\n\nIt’s due to be unveiled at Sony’s Mobile World Congress press conference,\nwhich is set for February 26. We’ll be reporting live from the ground as\nusual, so check back closer to the time for even more juicy details.\n\n**Do you like the sound of either the **Xperia L2, Xperia XA2 or Xperia XA2\nUltra?
