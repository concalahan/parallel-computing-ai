While I was one of the rare\nfans who enjoyed Ninja Theory’s DmC reboot back in 2013, it failed to capture\nthe original series’ spirit with its foul-mouthed Dante and borderline\nobsessive relationship with dubstep.\n\nNow, I love a good banger, but this wasn’t the aesthetic I’d come to expect\nfrom the beloved action franchise. This all changes with Devil May Cry 5, a\ndirect sequel to the fourth instalment that knows exactly what it’s doing in\nterms of story, style and being an absolute badass.\n\nMy demo begins as Nero and business partner/crafty engineer Nico stroll into a\ndevastated London aboard a rusty old van with ‘Devil May Cry’ scorned across\nthe side in bright, fluorescent neon. It’s clear from the first few seconds\nthat DMC is back, and it’s ready to let you know it.\n\n**Related:**[ **Best Xbox One\nGames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/xbox-one-games-3435271)\n\n![devil may cry\n5](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nAfter dropping you off, Nero is thrown straight into the action. London has\nbeen devastated, with demon running amok amongst the almost non-existent,\npost-brexit population. Obviously, being demons, they hone in on Nero in\nseconds, meaning it’s time for a fight. This is where Devil May Cry 5’s most\ninnovative new feature comes in: Devil Breaker.\n\nThis is Nero’s arm and can be detached and customised to your liking with an\narray of gnarly powers. Pressing the circle button elicits a small punch, but\nholding it is an entirely different story. When I did so, Nero threw a\nhorrendously hard punch before his arm spewed forth a constant beam of energy\nthat dealt absurd amounts of damage.\n\nIt looks amazing, too, solidifying how drastic a visual makeover Devil May Cry\nhas received. The brief demo allowed me to switch between a handful of\ndifferent Devil Breakers, so I imagine deeper equipment management is waiting\nin the wings. Nero can also use his artificial limb to fly toward enemies or\nthe exact opposite, launching across the environment at ludicrous speed. It\nalready feels amazing to play, and that’s with only three weapons at your\ndisposal.\n\nOf course, Nero’s Red Queen (Sword) and Blue Rose (Revolver) make a well-\ndeserved return and have also been gifted a scandalous redesign that helps his\ncharacter pop all the more. They’re heavy and satisfying to use, and indicate\nthat Devil May Cry 5 is aiming to make combat feel weightier and more\nconsequential than previous entries. Sending enemies back to the depths they\ncame from is a blast, especially when they look so horrific.\n\nUpgrades and customisation are confirmed and will be handled by Nico and her\ntrusty transit van, which can seemingly appear at certain points in the world\nto help Nero stock up on the fly. I’m crossing my fingers for unlockable bonus\ncostumes, which have long been a staple of the Capcom library. Perhaps a\ncheeky crossover with [Resident Evil 2\nRemake](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/resident-evil-2-remake-release-\ndate-gameplay-3261369) is in order?\n\n**Related:**[ **Cyberpunk\n2077**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/cyberpunk-2077-release-date-\ngameplay-2948412)\n\n![devil may cry\n5](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nUpon scouring through the streets of London, Nero is greeted by a huge,\ndemonic tree made of seemingly organic material. It looms ominously over the\ncity, and is most definitely our hero’s objective. It needs to be stopped, and\nhe’s happy to murder thousands of demons to make that happen. This includes\nboss encounters such as the grotesque ‘Incandescent Goliath.’\n\nThat’s not only a strong name, but also proved to be a formidable tussle that\nI escaped from unscathed. When a monster swallows up the world around you and\nfires it out of his belly as a flaming projectile, you know he isn’t messing\naround. I was initially concerned that Devil May Cry 5’s grounded visual style\nwould clash with its more outlandish elements, but that definitely isn’t the\ncase.\n\nRecent trailers confirmed that Devil May Cry 5 will launch three playable\ncharacters: Nero, Dante and an unnamed third, who could end up being Vergil,\nwho most recently appeared as a major villain in Devil May Cry 3. A trio of\nplayable faces promises plenty of variety and room for experimentation, a\nsaving grace as the game’s combat system encourages and rewards you for mixing\nup fighting styles whenever possible.\n\n## First Impressions\n\nDevil May Cry 5 is a glorious return for the outrageous action series,\nshowcasing all the important hallmarks while pushing the boundaries of what we\nexpect from it.\n\nNero controls with a demonic grace that has me itching to slay a bunch of\ndemons, it’s just a shame we’ll have to wait until March 2018 to take the\nreigns as some of the world’s greatest demon hunters.\n\n**Are you looking forward to Devil May Cry 5?
