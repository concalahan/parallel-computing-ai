Given the site’s hit and miss\nhistory of leaks, however, we’d suggest taking these reports with a sizeable\npinch of salt for now. Although trends would suggest a QHD display and\nimproved snapper will be on the S6’s hit-list, Samsung has yet to officially\nacknowledge the existence of such a device.\n\nOne of the most eagerly awaited upcoming smartphones, the Galaxy S6 will,\naccording to the latest reports, pair the same 16-megapixel, OIS-enhanced\nrear-mounted camera as found on the Note 4 with a upgraded 5-megapixel snapper\naround front.\n\nAnother crossover taken from the Note 4 will be increased storage capacities.\nThe S6 will reportedly ditch 16GB as the base storage option, instead opting\nfor 32GB, 64GB and 128GB capacities.\n\nGiven Samsung’s insistence on launching multi-configuration options of its\nbiggest phones, the Snapdragon 810 processor packing S6 will reportedly land\nalongside an Exynos loving handset.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThis Samsung-chipped option is tipped to run a new Exynos 7420 processor, a\n64-bit chip which pairs four Cortex-A53 cores with four Cortex-A57 cores.\n\nFurther features expected to be heading for the S6’s specs sheet include\nGoogle’s new Android 5.0 Lollipop OS and a new, in-house developed LTE modem.\n\nAlthough the latest leaks have failed to point to when the Galaxy S6 will\nenter the realms of reality, previous reports have pointed to a MWC 2015\nunveiling for the future [iPhone\n6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/iphone-6-review) rival.\n\n**Read More:** [Sony Xperia Z4 release\ndate](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/sony-xperia-z4-release-date-rumours-\nnews-specs-and-price)\n\n"}
