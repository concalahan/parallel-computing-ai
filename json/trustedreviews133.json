{"result": 0, "title": "Xbox One Backwards Compatibility: Modern Warfare 2 is now playable. | Trusted Reviews", "description": "![Xbox One\nX](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nXbox One backward compatibility is an incredibly popular feature, with a\ngrowing list of titles well worth checking out. The Xbox 360 had a wonderful\nlibrary of games, and it’s awesome to see them running on the [Xbox\nOne](https://www.trustedreviews.com/xbox-one-review).\n\nPlaying [Xbox 360](https://www.trustedreviews.com/microsoft-xbox-360-250gb-\nreview) titles on Xbox One is free and simple All you need to do is insert an\nXbox 360 disc into your system or download it directly from the online\nmarketplace. Much like Xbox One games, everything is installed straight to\nyour hard drive, so make sure you’ve got enough space. **  \n**\n\nAll of the digital downloads linked to your account will be available straight\naway, so long as the game is supported by Microsoft. Your achievements, cloud\nsaves and whatnot also carry over.\n\nIf you’re an Xbox Live Gold member, many of the games found in Microsoft’s\nGames with Gold service are backward compatible, giving you a handful of new\ngames to play around with each and every month.\n\nIt’s interesting to note that the\n[PS4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/playstation-4-review) is still not\nbackward compatible, with Sony instead throwing its eggs into the [Playstation\nNow](https://www.trustedreviews.com/playstation-now-review) service basket.\nThis lets you rent PS3 titles and stream them to your PS4 along with select\nSony Bravia Smart TVs and Sony Blu-ray players.\n\n**See also:[PS4 backwards compatibility – Can I play PS3 games on my\nPS4?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/ps4-backwards-compatibility-can-\nyou-play-ps3-games-on-ps4)**\n\n## Xbox One backwards compatibility – How does it work?\n\nTo turn the Xbox One into a backwards compatible machine, Microsoft has built\nan Xbox 360 emulator that will run on the new console. This basically means\nthat Microsoft has essentially built an Xbox 360 in software, which then runs\nwithin the Xbox One. This emulator does all the same things as the Xbox 360,\nbut it just sits inside the newer console.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Spintires: Mudrunners – American Wilds Edition\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/spintires-mudrunners-american-wilds-\nedition \"Spintires: Mudrunners – American Wilds Edition\")\n\n  * [ ![Galaxy Note 10](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Best Phone 2018: 10 best smartphones revealed and rated\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-smartphone-3431175 \"Best Phone\n2018: 10 best smartphones revealed and rated\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Wooting One Keyboard](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Wooting One\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/wooting-one \"Wooting One\")\n\n  * \n\nThe emulator springs into life when you insert a compatible Xbox 360 disc and\nlets you download and install the title right to your HDD. You’ll notice that\nany Xbox 360 game you have installed on your Xbox One will be shown with an\nXbox 360 logo strip down the left hand side, so you can quickly distinguish\nbetween your old and new games at a glance.\n\nAs you had to with the Xbox 360, you’ll need to keep the game disc in the tray\nwhile you play, but you won’t need to be connected to the internet unless you\nwant to access any of the game’s online components.  \n**  \nSee also:[ P](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/ps4-5-ps4k-playstation-\nneo-news-rumours-price-release-date-games-psvr)[S4 Pro vs PS4: Which is\nbetter?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/ps4-5-ps4k-playstation-neo-\nnews-rumours-price-release-date-games-psvr)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIf you’ve previously purchased any compatible Xbox 360 titles from the Store,\nthese will automatically show up in the right-hand panel of your “My Games and\nApps” section of your Xbox One, where it lists games that are “Ready to\nInstall”.\n\nYou can then pick and choose which games out of your Xbox 360 collection you\nwish to install on your Xbox One — after all you might not have space for all\nof them.\n\nWhat’s great about the Xbox One backwards compatibility service is that even\nthough it’s running your Xbox 360 games within an emulator, you can still take\nadvantage of the Xbox One features while you play.\n\n**Backwards Compatibility and multi-disc games**\n\nXbox’s Major Nelson confirmed in a\n[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/comments/4j4yca/_/d34c0hm?context=3) post that\nXbox One’s backwards compatibility now works for games with multiple discs.\n\n“I can confirm that the BC [backwards compatibility] team has done work to\nsupport multi disc scenarios. Be sure to thank the BC engineers,” Major Nelson\nwrote.\n\nSo now it seems the possibilities are truly endless when it comes to backwards\ncompatibility on Xbox One. For those looking for a bit of nostalgia amongst\nall their new and shiny gaming goodness, we could be seeing plenty more\navailable.\n\n## Xbox One backwards compatibility – How much does it cost?\n\nUnlike Playstation’s Now streaming service, which charges for all games even\nif you previously owned them, this Xbox 360 emulation on Xbox One will be\ncompletely free for all supported games. That’s definitely a nice touch.\n\n“It is free. You don’t have to pay for the emulator. You don’t have to pay\nagain for the games or anything. They’re your games. It just works,” added\nMoulster.\n\n**See also:[Upcoming Xbox One Games

Some games are a notable improvement over Xbox 360, while others\nfail to maintain a solid framerate due to the emulation. With any luck this\nwill improve over time as Microsoft refines and updates the feature.\n\nAlso, the same can be said for games like Guitar Hero or Rock Band due to the\nsame hardware issues.  \n**  \nSee also:[Xbox One vs Xbox 360](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/xbox-\none-vs-360)**  \n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n_**What games would you like to see added to Xbox One Backwards Compatibility?\nLet us know on Facebook and Twitter @trustedreviews.**_\n\n"}
