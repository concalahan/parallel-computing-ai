Set up a ‘romantic’ profile and Alexa will make\nyour bedroom redder than downtown Amsterdam before you can so much as say,\n“Giggity.”\n\n  * **[Get Skill](http://amzn.to/2gRwERO)**\n\n## 7) Control your thermostat\n\n![Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd-\ngen](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAlexa now supports the Nest range of Learning Thermostats, meaning you can\nsimply say “Hey Alexa, raise the living room temperature by 2 degrees,” and\nyou’ll be toastier than chestnuts roasting on an open fire.\n\n  * **[Get Skill](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nest-Labs-Inc/dp/B01LXYILGF/ref=sr_1_1?tag=georiot-trd-21&s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1484241779&sr=1-1&keywords=nest&ascsubtag=trd-21465845-21)**\n\n## 8) Uber: Call for a ride\n\n**![uber](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \n**  \nUber is a little fiddly to set up with Alexa, but once you’ve got it sorted,\nit does feel a little bit like magic.\n\nIt took us a couple of attempts to link an Uber account to our Echo, and If\nyou try to just ask for an Uber, Alexa will tell you to ask for it in a\nspecific way.\n\nAfter you’ve got the knack though, just say the necessary incantation and a\nride will roll up outside your location. Neat.\n\n  * **[Get Skill](http://amzn.to/2hEZ7u5)** ****\n\n## 9) 7-Minute Workout: Get a guide workout\n\nJust say, “Alexa, start 7-minute workout,” and shock of all horrors, Alexa\nwill take your candy ass through a 7-minute workout!\n\nIf you’re unsure of any of the exercises, the app on your phone will show you\nlittle pictures of what you should do.\n\nIt’d be nice if Alexa was a bit more encouraging, or played some music to help\nmotivate you, but it’s pretty good all the same.\n\n  * **[Get Skill](http://amzn.to/2hlLeS5)**\n\n## 10) Spotify: The best for music streaming\n\n![Spotify](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSpotify is the best music streaming service around, and with Echo, Premium\nsubscribers can simply shout out what they want to be played, be it a specific\nartist, mood, playlist and even decade.\n\nIt’s a no-brainer to enable as soon as you fire up your new smart speaker and,\nbetter still, it comes pre-loaded – just enable it as your default music\nplayer and you’re away.\n\n  * [**Learn more**](https://support.spotify.com/us/listen_everywhere/on_speaker/spotify-amazon-speakers/)\n\n## 11) Wake up to your favourite song\n\nWhile we’re on the subject of music, as of December 18, Echo users can now\ncommand Alexa to wake them up to the tunes of their choice. Whether you need\nsome heavy metal to stun you out of your slumber, or some Marvin Gaye for a\nrelaxing Sunday morning in bed with the paper, Alexa has you covered.\n\nYou won’t need an additional Skill download for this; just say “Alexa wake me\nat 8am to…” and choose from artists, playlists, tracks or even a random\nselection. Best news is it works with all supported music services.\n\n## 12) Control your whole home entertainment set-up\n\n![Logitech Harmony\nElite](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIf you’re the proud owner of a Logitech Harmony Hub and a compatible remote,\nthen you can use your Echo to add voice controls. You can command Alexa to\nturn on the TV or media player, or play and pause content on your television\nscreen, This is particularly handy if you’ve lost the remote down the back of\nthe sofa.\n\nA recent improvement even simplified the voice controls. You can simply say\n“Alexa, turn up the volume/turn on BBC 1.”\n\n  * **[Get Skill](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Logitech-Harmony/dp/B01M4LDPX3/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1513947401&sr=1-1&keywords=harmony)**\n\n## 13) The Guardian: All the latest news\n\nAsk Alexa for the latest news, headlines, podcasts and more with this skill –\nshe’ll even read you entire articles if you want.\n\nIt’s well useful for all those times you want to meditate on how horrible the\nworld is whilst doing the washing up…\n\n  * **[Get Skill](http://amzn.to/2hlUuG3)**\n\n## 14) Sky Sports: Never miss a goal\n\n![Sky\nSports](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nGetting mad when your team concedes a last minute equaliser has never been\neasier, as Alexa will feed you back all the latest scores and sport news.\n\nIt’s available on your snazzzy right out of the box, so all you have to do is\nask.\n\n## 15) National Rail: Get train updates\n\nGone are the days of having to fiddle with an app to find out Southern’s\nfecked up your commute again.\n\nWith Echo, all you’ll need to do is chat to Alexa for a breakdown of the\nlatest morning misery.

Alexa might just be\nyour saviour, as you can ask your Echo to remind you about meetings and other\nimportant events\n\nNeglected an anniversary, for example? Combine your reminder with begging\nAlexa to order some last minute flowers for the ultimate in time-efficient\ngetting out of jail.\n\n  * **[Get Skill](http://amzn.to/2gwCYli)**\n\n## 17) Control Fire TV with your Echo\n\n![Amazon Fire\nTV](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nMost Amazon Fire TV devices now come with an Alexa voice remote, but if it’s\nacross the other side of the room, that’s a whole lot of energy expenditure\nthat could be used for keeping warm. So, US Echo owners (and we’re hoping UK\nsoon), can now control their Fire TV devices with Alexa on the Amazon Echo.\n\nYou could say “Alexa open Hulu” or Alexa “show me comedy films” for example.\nYou can even say “Show me films with Clint Eastwood,” leveraging the universal\nsearch feature.\n\nIf you only have one Fire TV, Alexa should complete the pairing process\nautomatically.\n\n## 7 more cool Alexa integrations\n\n**1) LG’s new Smart InstaView Fridge** comes with Alexa functionality\n\n**2) Ford’s Sync 3** infotainment platform now supports certain Alexa voice\ncontrols\n\n**3)** Former Featured Kickstarter\n**[Bixi](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/bixi-adds-gesture-control-to-any-\nsmart-device-and-is-our-crowdfunding-pick-of-the-week)** has unveiled a new\nremote featuring Alexa\n\n**4)[Lenovo’s Smart Assistant](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lenovo-s-\nsmart-assistant-home-hub-is-here-and-it-s-got-alexa-smarts)** speaker bakes in\nfull Alexa smarts\n\n**5)** The latest 4K TVs from affordable brands **Seiki, Westinghouse and\nElement** offer native Alexa support\n\n**6) Nabi** has a kid-friendly smart speaker called Aristotle, which is\npowered by Alexa\n\n**7) Whirlpool** promised its full line-up of connected wares will sync with\nAlexa this year\n\n**Related:[Amazon Black Friday\n2017](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/amazon-black-friday-\ndeals-2017-uk-2993188)**\n\n## And some Alexa Skills to avoid…\n\n**![Just eat\nrobot](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)**\n\n**Acoustic Tuner** : This Alexa ‘skill’ doesn’t even listen to your strumming,\nit just spits out a generic tone for you to aspire to.\n\nIt’s worse than even the cheapest digital tuner you could buy, so just avoid.\n\n**Just Eat** : Alexa claims to be able to repeat any Just Eat order you’ve\nplaced before but, alas, it doesn’t work.\n\nAccording to the instructions, all you have to do is order something via the\ndelivery service, and then you can re-order simply by uttering the correct\nphrase.\n\n**Related:[Amazon Echo setup\nguide](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/amazon-echo-setup)**\n\nWe tried it out, ordering a pizza using a computer like some fossil from the\n90s, and then tried to repeat the order with Alexa, who refused to acknowledge\nwe’d ever had a cheesy, greasy 3,000 calorie disc of joy shipped to the front\ndoor.\n\nIf you look at the user reviews, everyone is having this problem, so while\nthis could be useful one day, it’s best left on the backburner for now.\n\n**Daily Cat Facts** : Just what we all need.
