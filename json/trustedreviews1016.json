With the consumer-ready release of [iOS\n12](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ios-12-release-date-features-3385158),\nwe’ll all finally be able to create ‘Memojis’ of our own.\n\n## What is an Animoji?\n\nIn case you missed the hype, Animojis are the company’s fully 3D rigged\ncharacter heads modelled on popular emoji icons that can mimic your facial\nexpressions based on data pulled directly from the [iPhone\nX](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-x)’s TrueDepth camera array.\n\nWhilst the popularity of its use within Apple’s native Messages app remains\nquestionable, the feature did give rise to the Animoji Karaoke trend that had\nfoxes, monkeys, aliens and even unicorns miming along to popular tunes on\nsocial media (before copyright strikes pulled many of them down again).\n\nAt the start of 2018 Apple even built on the trend itself, releasing a series\nof truncated music videos using the same technique. Then, with the unveiling\nof iOS 12 at [WWDC 18](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/wwdc-2018-3399519),\nthe company revealed that it would be introducing new characters to the\nAnimoji roster and launch a new variation on the technology called ‘Memojis’.\n\n## What is a Memoji?\n\nMemojis use the same clever face-tracking tech as Animojis but this time turn\nyou into the subject, taking the shape of a highly-customisable avatar\nmodelled on your likeness. They can exist against a white void, just as\nAnimojis first did, or sit as an overlay on your face in real-time when using\nyour iPhone’s camera.\n\n## How do you make a Memoji?\n\nTo make one, you’ll simply need to press the ‘+’ symbol in the Animoji section\nof the Messages app, then start creating your likeness by choosing from\nvarious options including skin colour, hairstyles and eye colour.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nYou’ll also be able to add accessories including earrings and sunglasses,\nbefore saving your digital face into your Animojis ‘team’.\n\n## What new Animojis are slated for iOS 12?\n\nWhilst some additions have already started popping up for existing iOS 11\nusers, such as the lion, dragon, skull and bear, the full cast of expressive\nnew characters that come with iOS 12 includes a ghost, koala, tiger and T-Rex.\n\nTongue detection is another new development slated for the next release of iOS\ntoo, so that’s good…?\n\n## Which devices support Animojis and Memojis?\n\nAs a feature, Memojis are expected to be supported by any iPhone that sports a\nTrueDepth camera array, which means the existing iPhone X as well as the\nrumoured iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, which are expected to be launching\nalongside iOS 12 on September 12.\n\n**Are you an Animoji fan or has Apple gone one gimmick too far?
