Neither watch\nis out just yet, but which will deserve a place on your wrist?**\n\nWith its recently announced Fitbit Ionic, the market leader in fitness\ntrackers made a bold move into the fully-fledged smartwatch category,\nincluding many of the features that made the [Apple Watch\n2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/apple-watch-2) such a fantastic\nhybrid fitness smartwatch. With the announcement of the Apple Watch 3 we’ve\nnow seen Apple’s response.\n\n**Related:[Best Apple Watch Black Friday\ndeals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-apple-watch-deals-3238555)**\n\nBefore we kick off deciding which is a better fit for your needs, if you’re\nconsidering any Apple Watch, keep in mind you’ll need to have an iPhone to\npair it with. There’s no such problem with the Fitbit Ionic, which will\nhappily work with iPhone and Android phones alike.\n\n**Related:[Best Fitbit](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-fitbit_round-up)**\n\n## Apple Watch 3 vs Fitbit Ionic – Design and display\n\nApple and Fitbit are the two main companies still releasing non-circular\nsmartwatches today, with most manufacturers opting to release smartwatches\nthat look more like traditional watches. There are certainly pros and cons to\nboth approaches, with legibility of information on a squared-off watch being\none of the distinct advantages.\n\nThe Apple Watch 3 has a 38mm option with 272 x 340 resolution and a 42mm\noption with 312 x 390 resolution. Both models have a 1000nits display\nbrightness, which is great for outdoor use. The Apple Watch 3 sees the return\nof the characteristic rotating crown, which is a clever way of interacting\nwith the screen without getting your fingers in the way of the screen.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe Fitbit Ionic uses a 1.42-inch touchscreen with a 348 x 250 resolution that\ngoes up to 1000nits in brightness. The resolution also means the display is\none of the sharpest smartwatches out there. Rather than a rotating digital\ncrown, the Ionic has three hardware buttons flanking its display. At launch,\nit will be available in three different colour combinations with replaceable\nwrist straps that use quick release clips.\n\nBoth smartwatches include water-resistance to 50m, meaning they’re safe in the\npool and the shower.\n\n## Apple Watch 3 vs Fitbit Ionic – Sensors and specifications\n\nBoth smartwatches include the main sensors you would expect of a fitness-\noriented smartwatch, including: GPS, accelerometer and heart rate monitor. The\nFitbit Ionic also has the advantage of an altimeter, which allows it to track\nyour elevation data during exercise, making those mountainous bike rides more\nworthwhile for fans of data. The Apple Watch 3, unlike the Apple Watch 2, now\nhas an onboard altimeter, meaning you don’t need to use a paired iPhone for\nelevation data.\n\nThe Fitbit Ionic also has a Relative SpO2 sensor, which can detect blood\noxygen levels. Fitbit hasn’t said what it plans to use this for just yet, but\nit has potential for improved sleep tracking by detecting conditions such as\nsleep apnoea. The Apple Watch Series 3 could potentially support such sensors\nseparately through its improved core Bluetooth support.\n\n![Fitbit\nIonic](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nBoth the Apple Watch 3 and Fitbit Ionic support their own versions of\ncontactless payments through Apple Pay and Fitbit Pay. This means you can\nleave your wallet behind and still make payments through a debit or credit\ncard attached to payments account.\n\nThe Apple Watch 3 has an optional cellular LTE model, which has its own e-SIM\ninside. This means it has its own data and cellular connection so you’re not\nreliant on your iPhone. This means you can make and receive calls directly\nfrom the Apple Watch 3, as well as respond to messages or do anything else\nthat requires connectivity. The great news is that the e-SIM will use the same\nphone number as your iPhone. No more separate phone number for your wearable.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nOnboard storage for both, around 2GB for the Apple Watch 3 and 2.5GB on the\nFitbit Ionic, will let you store your favourite workout playlist, and you can\npair wireless Bluetooth headphones. Fitbit hasn’t revealed what chipset is\npowering Fitbit OS on the Ionic, but we do know the Apple Watch 3 will use\nApple’s custom wearable chipset, the S3, which has been improved considerably\nover its predecessor.\n\n## Apple Watch 3 vs Fitbit Ionic – Activity and exercise tracking\n\nAs with most smartwatches released today, health and fitness play prominent\nroles in both the Apple Watch 3 and Fitbit Ionic. You can expect the usual\nactivity tracking during the day, keeping tabs on the amount of steps you take\nas well as letting you know you’ve been a bit too sedentary for too long.\n\nBoth smartwatches are water-resistant, so include swim-tracking for those who\nenjoy getting in a few laps at the pool. Both devices are able to detect the\nnumber of laps swum as well as recognising different strokes.\n\nOne of Fitbit’s strengths is its automatic exercise tracking, meaning you can\njust start exercising and it will log the details without any user input. This\nworks for walking, running, cycling and elliptical machines. When running, the\nwatch will even urn on its GPS and track your route information for you\nwithout you having to do anything. Just lace up your running shoes and set\noff.\n\nThe Apple Watch 3 isn’t as automated but it does support a wide range of\nsports and exercises, which is to be bolstered further with watchOS 4. More\nniche activities such as bowling, skiing and functional strength training are\nto be added.\n\nApple has another extra feature called GymKit. This lets you pair your Apple\nWatch with compatible gym equipment such as treadmills or elliptical machines.\nThe Apple Watch is then able to share two-way data with the equipment. This\nmeans your user data, such as age and weight, can be shared with the\nequipment, alongside your heart rate data, so you get more accurate calorie\nburn. The machine in turn can share data such as distance and elevation,\nautomatically logging a workout in the Apple Watch’s Workout app. Having tried\nthis out, it’s definitely very useful for logging your indoor workouts.\n\n**Related:[Best fitness trackers](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nfitness-tracker)**\n\n![Fitbit\nIonic](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Apple Watch 3 vs Fitbit Ionic – Smartwatch functionality and apps\n\nThis is one area where the Apple Watch 3 has a distinct advantage thanks to\nhow long the Apple Watch range has been around, as well as the popularity.\nThere’s a wide range of apps available on watchOS from shopping to\nproductivity and even games. The smartwatch side is also a much stronger\noffering with far more convenient features available, such as receiving calls\nfrom your wrist or making requests to Siri by using the built-in microphone,\nwhich isn’t available on the Fitbit Ionic due to a lack of a microphone.\n\nYou’re also able to respond to incoming messages through a range of methods\nincluding using handwriting recognition and your voice. The Fitbit Ionic is\nmuch more passive for now, merely mirroring your notifications to your wrist.\nIt’s better than having to whip out your phone all the time but there’s\ndefinitely room for improvement.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIt’ll take time for more apps to become available for Fitbit OS, too, but\nFitbit is promising development will be approachable, something it’s leveraged\nfrom the acquisition of Pebble. For now there will only be limited apps\navailable at launch but expect more to come. One we know that’s definitely on\nthe way is support for Deezer in 2018. So you’ll at least have an extra option\nalongside the Pandora support that’s only available in tbe US.\n\nBoth the Apple Watch 3 and Fitbit Ionic will let you customise the watchface\nfor a more personal experience but the Apple Watch 3 has the edge again here\nthanks to context sensitive information being delivered straight to a new Siri\nwatchface in [watchOS 4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-\nwatchos-4-new-features-release-date-download-2950900). New with the Apple\nWatch 3 is the ability for Siri to speak to you through the built-in speaker\nmeaning you don’t even need to look at the screen for information.\n\n![Fitbit\nIonic](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Apple Watch 3 vs Fitbit Ionic – Battery life\n\nBattery life has always been a stumbling block for smartwatches to date. The\nApple Watch 2 helped improve things with more than two days of use. The Fitbit\nIonic could well be the watch for you if you value sheer longevity, however.\nFitbit is reporting more than 4 days use from a single charge, although you’ll\nonly get 10 hours of GPS tracking. That’s mighty impressive.\n\nThe Apple Watch 3 will have the same battery life as the Apple Watch 2, which\nApple rates at around 18 hours. We’ve seen more than two days dependent on\nuse. Battery life when using the GPS for an outdoor workout is only rated at 5\nhours, however, or just 4 hours if using GPS and LTE. Battery life is where\nthe Fitbit Ionic has the distinct edge.\n\n## Apple Watch 3 vs Fitbit Ionic – Which is better value for money?\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe Fitbit Ionic will launch at £299 in the UK. The Apple Watch 3 will cost\n£329 for the GPS model and £399 for the GPS + Cellular option. That’s not a\nlot separating the entry-level Apple Watch 3 and Fitbit Ionic, so the Fitbit\nwill have its work cut out convincing people to not go with the more\nestablished wearable.
