It’s\na series I’ve personally loved since it debuted in 2004, even though it’s been\nconsidered by many to be overshadowed by its competitors. For a developer to\nmake a single series for 13 years and still deliver a title such as Horizon\nZero Dawn is incredible. Not only is it comfortably the most gorgeous-looking\ngame on [PlayStation 4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/playstation-4-review),\nbut it’s also brilliant fun to play – and often verges on masterpiece levels\nof game design.\n\nLet’s start with those visuals. Ahead of launch in carefully chosen gameplay\nfootage, you’ll no doubt have seen just how stunning this game is. What’s\nsurprising is how it remains consistently beautiful through every frame.\nPlaying on [PS4 Pro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/ps4-pro-review), this\nadventure is easily the best example of\n[4K](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/4k-tv-10-reasons-why-you-should-\ncare) and [HDR](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/hdr-tv-high-dynamic-\ntelevision-explained) I’ve yet to experience. If you’ve been looking for a\nreason to justify purchasing either the Pro or an expensive new TV, Zero Dawn\nis it.\n\nWhen running around completing missions it can be easy to forget that Horizon\noffers beauty in every landscape. Taking the time to stop and take in the view\nnever fails to disappoint. The lush greenery that Aloy, our flame-haired\nheroine, sneaks through to hunt animalistic machines, the sun-kissed desert\nthat whips up sandstorms as she rides through the mountains or the snow-\ncovered trees – every frame is a painting with no detail spared.\n\n**Related:[Horizon Zero Dawn – The Frozen Wilds\nReview](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/horizon-zero-dawn-frozen-\nwilds)**\n\nYou know a developer is confident in its game’s visuals when it includes a\ndedicated photo mode, and I’ve spent more time taking snaps in Horizon’s world\nthan I have on most holidays. I’ve said it already, but this is the best-\nlooking game on PS4. Yes, even better than [Uncharted\n4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/uncharted-4-review).\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Budget tax](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### UK announces ‘digital services’ tax on tech giants – here’s what you need\nto know\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/uk-digital-services-tax-budget-3612456\n\"UK announces ‘digital services’ tax on tech giants – here’s what you need to\nknow\")\n\n  * [ ![Best Steam Deals](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### When is the next Steam Sale?

In my time with Horizon\nI’ve experienced hardly any issues and not a single noticeable framerate drop.\nThe only slight quibble is occasional texture pop-in as the game is a bit late\nto load the surrounding scenery, but other than that, I’m often wondering how\non earth this thing is running on a PS4. This was the type of experience I\nthought I had to buy a top-end PC to experience.\n\nWhen you’re done gawking at the scenery, you’ll be moving through Aloy’s\nengaging and compelling story. It’s well told and assisted by excellent voice\nacting from every cast member. Guerilla Games has set up some excellent themes\nthat kept me invested even when there could be hours between campaign\nmissions.\n\nIn a post-post-apocalypse, Aloy – a young huntress based in the northern\nregions of a vast land – seeks to discover more about her past. She’s\nsurrounded by a people who, in the face of fear and uncertainty, have devolved\nand retreated into tribalism, blind faith and violence. Aloy’s hunt for not\nonly her past, but the past of the human civilisation that came before the\ndivided one in which she exists, is incredibly intriguing.\n\n**Related:[Best PS4 Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nps4-games)**\n\n**![Horizons Zero Dawn\n3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)  \n**  \nIt kept me invested because this is a story unlike any other in video games.\nThere are clear inspirations – Zero Dawn’s map structure is reminiscent of\n[Game of Thrones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/game-of-thrones-\nseason-7-release-date-trailer-got-spoilers-predictions-uk), except with robots\ninstead of White Walkers and incestuous royalty. The Nora – Aloy’s adoptive\npeople – represent the Northern tribe, and as such are treated as savages. As\nthe story slowly peels itself away, you’ll only become desperate to find out\nmore. It is why my attempts to play for just 30 minutes often led to several\nhours of solid gameplay. The extended sessions were aided by an incredibly\nsatisfying combat system, too.\n\nZero Dawn was announced at a time when it seemed every game needed a bow and\narrow. Rise of the Tomb Raider and [The Last of\nUs](https://www.trustedreviews.com/the-last-of-us-remastered-review) did it to\ngood effect, but Aloy’s use of wood and string is the most enjoyable of the\nlot. Her freedom of movement on the battlefield, coupled with a vast arsenal\nwhich only grows larger, makes every encounter incredibly tactical.\n\nAloy must focus on stripping these vast machines of their armour, exploiting\nweaknesses to elemental damage or vulnerabilities in their structure to take\nthem down. There aren’t any easy fights, either – Aloy is often the weakest\ndog in the fight. This is why taking on multiple enemies at once is usually\nfutile, and in many cases it’s wiser to either avoid confrontation or stick to\nstealth. I’ve died plenty of times in battles, no matter how much I improved.\n\nThis doesn’t become frustrating, but what is annoying is a problem Guerilla\ncarries over from Killzone: the lack of clear damage indication during fights.\nWhen Aloy is hit, it’s very hard to tell how close she is to death in the heat\nof battle. After one hit, a quick look at the health bar tells me she’s lost\naround 15%, so I carry on, only for her to die from seemingly innocuous\nattacks seconds later. It becomes incredibly annoying during the more crucial\nencounters, and no matter how aware you are of the problem, the act of\nspinning plates is too much at times. Even Call of Duty’s heavy breathing or\nblood spatter would be more informative.\n\nBetween fights Aloy will need to forage for resources. Horizon teeters on the\nbrink of becoming diet Diablo with its approach to gathering everything in\nsight, particularly in the early hours of play, but soon you’ll become\naccustomed to the myriad items you must utilise. Hunting not only robots, but\nalso the animals of the world to create health potions, new weapons, traps and\nmore are vital in order to remain well equipped for what lies ahead, and it’s\nnot long before you’ll be crafting plenty more and resources you believed to\nbe plentiful quickly become empty.\n\n**Related:[Monster Hunter World\nReview](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/monster-hunter-world)**\n\n**![Horizons Zero Dawn\n4](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)  \n**  \nThis is why running from location to location isn’t such a chore. While there\nmay be several miles between objectives, quick-travel isn’t always the most\nviable option, as gathering materials is often a necessity. It also helps that\nthere’s a huge number of side missions to do along the way.\n\nGuerilla has put as much thought into its side quests as the main missions,\nmeaning I want to collect each of them and keep them in my to-do list, ticking\noff as many as possible before moving on to the next main campaign mission.\nEach has its own self-contained narrative, much like a tale in The Witcher 3,\nand speaking to inhabitants of the world once again is great because of the\ngreat visual design and voice acting.\n\nIn terms of what Aloy must actually do, the game doesn’t offer much variety:\ngo here, use Aloy’s Focus to discover a track, follow it, fight the enemy.\nThat’s more often than not the pattern of most side missions, but that’s fine\nas the gameplay loop is satisfying and again the stories keep me invested.\n\nThe problems arise more in the menus and UI. The waypoint system means it can\noften be tricky to actually get to the objective, as the marker is often all\nover the place. The marker that’s placed in the centre of the screen tends to\nfollow the main pathways, whereas the marker that’s placed on the compass atop\nthe screen is as the crow flies, meaning they’ll contradict each other,\nespecially when Aloy ventures off the beaten track. There have been many times\nI’ve resorted to opening the main map and using that to guide me instead, as\nthe in-game guide is useless and sometimes sends me on the longest route\npossible.\n\n**Related:[Yakuza 6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/yakuza-6-release-\ndate-gameplay-news-trailer-story-pre-order-3249392) **\n\n**![Horizons Zero Dawn\n5](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)  \n**  \nAnother issue is the selection of active quests. Aloy can only select one\nquest at a time, but this also includes tutorials which can often be completed\nduring a main or side mission. For example, after obtaining a new weapon, its\ntutorial might instruct you to “kill five machines” with it. This tutorial,\nand its rewards will only be earned while the quest is active, but doing so\nwill deactivate all other quests. It’s a minor issue, but it is annoying that\nI can’t simultaneously complete overlapping missions.\n\n## VERDICT\n\nI didn’t expect Horizon Zero Dawn to be this good. I doubt I’ll be the only\none saying they were surprised that the Killzone developer has been able to\ndeliver a game with such breadth, depth, and consistently rewarding gameplay.\n\nCouple all of that with a compelling story led by an engaging lead protagonist\nand you have a brilliant game, an absolute must-buy for all PS4 owners.\n\nThose with a PS4 Pro and an HDR TV will find an even more beautiful experience\non offer, but everybody who plays Horizon: Zero Dawn is in for an absolute\ntreat.\n\n## Score\n\n  \n\n"}
