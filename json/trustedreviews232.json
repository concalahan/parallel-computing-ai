The big improvement here is that AirPlay will now be able to\nhandle streaming to multiple speakers, and will function much more like a\nmulti-room system, similar to that of Sonos.\n\nAt the moment, the biggest beneficiaries of AirPlay 2 will be HomePod owners.\nWith the iOS 11.4 update installed, you’ll be able to pair together two of the\nspeakers to deliver a much wider soundstage.\n\nHowever, as more AirPlay 2 devices enter the market you’ll be able to\nintegrate them into your multi-room setup. You’ll then be able to sync music\nacross multiple speakers, pair speakers together in stereo, or else control\ndifferent music across different rooms from a single iOS device.\n\nThe other big feature that’s set to arrive in iOS 11.4 is Messages on iCloud,\nwhich will allow you to sync your sent messages across different iOS devices −\nhandy if you don’t want to lose your conversation history when you move to a\nnew phone.\n\n## iOS 11.4 download\n\nNot everyone will get access to the new update at the same time, as Apple is\nexpected to roll them out gradually starting from 10am PT (6pm UK time).\n\nHowever, you can check if the update is available for you by heading into the\n**Settings** menu, tapping **General** and then selecting **Software Update**.\nIf the 11.4 update is available then it will show up here, otherwise you’ll\nsee a message saying that your device is already up to date.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nIt can take a couple of hours for updates to become available, so be patient.\n\n**Have you tried out iOS 11.4 through one of the betas?
