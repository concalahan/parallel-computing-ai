In an interview with\n[IGN](http://uk.ign.com/articles/2016/06/14/e3-2016-state-of-\ndecay-2-is-4-player-co-op-isnt-an-mmo), studio founder Jeff Strain explained\nthat the game did start off in that genre, before becoming what it is now,\nwith the team aiming to give fans “exactly what they want”.\n\n**Related:[Xbox One S vs PS4\nPro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/ps4-pro-vs-xbox-one-s)**\n\n**![state of decay\n2](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)  \n**  \n“This is not a session-based experience. It’s drop-in/drop-out,” Strain\nexplained. “The key thing that I want everybody to know is, it doesn’t require\nyou to be online. We’ve designed it very much with the intention of it being\nthe easiest, most convenient type of multiplayer you can imagine”\n\n## State of Decay 2 gameplay – What can we expect?\n\nState of Decay 2 looks set to refine and evolve the gameplay seen in the\noriginal game, which saw players scavenge for resources and build communities\namong the wastelands of rural communities left behind in the outbreak. Working\ntogether with fellow survivors, players must try and maintain order as long as\npossible before total chaos breaks out and you must flee to another location.\n\nUnlike the first game, there will be no single protagonist. Instead, each\ncharacter will be given different stats and traits, with each playing their\nrole within the group to help everyone survive.  \n**  \nRelated:[Best Xbox One Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-xbox-one-\ngames_round-up)  \n**\n\n**![state of decay\n2](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)  \n**  \nUndead Labs recently confirmed that State of Decay 2 will include three\nindividual maps at launch. All of your resources will carry across them, too.\nThis should make it far easier to prepare yourself against the flesh eating\nmenace. The maps will be incredibly varied, each roughly the same size as the\nfirst game’s entire landmass.\n\n“You should expect to see slightly different environments, definitely\ndifferent landmarks and locations, different layouts lending themselves to\ndifferent strategies, unique home sites, and even different mission types,”\nUndead said.\n\n## State of Decay 2 trailer – How does it look?\n\nIGN First has released a healthy chunk of gameplay footage you can watch\nbelow:\n\n**_What do you hope to see from State of Decay 2?
