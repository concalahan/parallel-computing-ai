While Apple’s iOS progresses with\nnumbers, Google is making its way through a diabetes-inducing roster of\ndelicious food in alphabetical order – and Android N is next.\n\nPrevious Android software names included: _Cupcake (1.5), Donut (1.6), Éclair\n(2.0), Froyo (2.2), Gingerbread (2.3), Honeycomb (3.0), Ice Cream Sandwich\n(4.0), Jelly Bean (4.1), KitKat (4.4), Lollipop (5.0), and Marshmallow (6.0)_.\n\nBut what is Android N going to be called? Well, at its\n[I/O](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/google-io-2016-news-what-to-\nexpect) developer conference keynote,Google revealed it had launched a new\n[website](https://www.android.com/versions/name-n/) that lets anyone suggest a\nname for Android N. Google says it plans to search through the lot and pick\nout a winner.\n\nIn the spirit of this news, here are some of the most eligible – and most\nyummy – candidates for the Android N branding.\n\n![android n\nname](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)What’s your favourite name?\n\n## Nutella\n\nOh, Nutella. Sweet, sweet Nutella. This scrummy hazelnut cocoa spread is one\nof the world’s most recognised brands. That’s mostly because it’s seriously\ntasty and you can put it on almost anything, software included.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n**For:** Nutella was always the frontrunner for the role, in terms of\nspeculation anyway. It’s famous, everyone loves it (peanut-allergists\nnotwithstanding), and it hails from Italy…just like Western civilisation. A\nshoo-in, no doubt.\n\n**Against:** Everyone thinks Android N will be named after Nutella, which may\nbe a big incentive for Google to give us the slip with another name entirely.\nSneaky Google.\n\n![android n name\n13](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Nougat\n\nNutella is a brand name, which makes things complicated. But nougat is just\nnuts, egg, fruit and some sugar, and that means it’s fair game for Google.\n\n**For:** Nougat is great, and it’s fun to say. _Nougaaat_. Say it.\n\n**Against:** There’s nothing sexy about nougat. Marshmallow is gooey and\nversatile. Lollipops are great too. But nougat is little more than congealed\nnuts. Google is better than congealed nuts, surely?\n\n![android n name\n9](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)  \n**Related:[Best Android Smartphones 2016](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-\nandroid-phones-1_round-up)**\n\n## Neapolitan Ice Cream\n\nThe humble Neapolitan ice cream, yet another product of Italy, and a staple\ndessert for Farmfoods shoppers in summertime. The triple-threat of vanilla,\nchocolate, and strawberry flavours will give the other contenders a run for\ntheir money.\n\n**For:** Neapolitan ice cream is fragmented. Just like Android.\n\n**Against:** Three words is a bit long for an Android name, as proved by the\ntongue-tiring Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich. We’re exhausted already.\n\n![android n name\n3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\n## New York Cheesecake\n\nBehold, breaker of diets and widener of waistbands: it’s the New York\ncheesecake. It’s a regional cheesecake variant that relies heavily on cream.\nHeavy, heavy cream. God bless America.\n\n**For:** New York is a world-power city like no other. And cheesecake is one\nof the most universally beloved desserts. Did we mention the heavy, heavy\ncream?\n\n**Against:** Google has fans all over the planet, but a dessert named after a\nsingle US city? That’s non-inclusive – this is 2016, after all! We’re all\nabout diversity here at _TrustedReviews_ , and Nuneaton deserves just as much\nlove as New York, even if it doesn’t have its own cheesecake. Or anything at\nall, really.\n\n![android n name\n7](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\n## Nut Brittle\n\nLike nougat, nut brittle is beholden to no trademark law. It’s smashed-up\nsugar candy, so Google can nab it with ease.\n\n**For:** Nut brittle is a popular treat in the US, Europe, and the Middle East\n– it’s a dessert without borders. Just like Android.\n\n**Against:** Nut brittle is cheap to make. Computer software is expensive to\nmake. This is a relationship that just won’t work.\n\n![android n name\n11](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Nerds\n\nNerds is fast catching up with Nutella as a favourite for the win. It’s an\nAmerican candy produced by Nestlé, so there are some trademark crinkles that\nneed to be ironed out, but it’s possibly the most appropriate name we’ve seen\nso far.\n\n**For:** Isn’t it _obvious_?\n\n**Against:** Nerd. Geek. Boffin. Throw off the chains of stereotyping and fly\nfree, you ruddy basement dwellers.\n\n![android n name\n5](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\n## Nankhatai, Nolen Gur, Namak Pare\n\nIf you hadn’t noticed, Google’s new CEO Sundar Pichai is Indian. Well, India\n_has_ noticed, which is why many of the subcontinent’s most ardent fans reckon\n2016 could be the year that Android is named after an Indian dessert:\nNankhatai, Nolen Gur, Namak Pare – take your pick.\n\n**For:** India is one of Android’s biggest markets. In fact, by 2017, IDC\nreckons India will be the third biggest market for smartphones globally. This\nis arguably a better case than the one for New York cheesecake, anyway.\n\n**Against:** What the heck is Nankhatai?\n\n![android n\nname](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \n**Related:[Best Android Apps 2016](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-\nandroid-apps_round-up)**\n\n**Hands-on with Android N:**\n\n**What do you think Android N should be called?
