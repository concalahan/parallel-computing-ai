The Mate 20 Pro pulls the same trick with graduatedglass backs in a wider assortment of colours, some of which also debut an all-new ‘hyper optical’ hairline pattern that improves grip too.**Related:[Best Phablets](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-phablet-3500572)**Both phones rock a triple camera array on their backs, although the Mate 20makes its camera setup more of a feature, setting them within a rounded squarein the centre of the phone’s back. Whether this is a design improvement ishard to say, but it certainly helps the Mate 20 Pro stand out from the crowdof other glass-backed rivals out there.## Mate 20 Pro vs P20 Pro: How do their specs and features differ?Even though both phones follow similar principles, everything has been ampedup on the Mate 20 Pro.The P20 Pro uses Huawei’s late-2017 flagship processor, the Kirin 970, whilethe new 7nm Kirin 980 makes its debut on the Mate 20 Pro, promising up to a20% speed improvement and a 40% improvement in power efficiency over the olderchip. Both phones also come with 6GB of RAM, so they’re well-equipped fordemanding multitasking and the like.The special edition leather-backed P20 Pro does offer a little extra oomphwith a whopping 8GB of RAM, but it’ll likely still fall short of the Kirin980’s advanced efficiency.| **P20 Pro** | **Mate 20 Pro**  ---|---|---  **Dimensions** |  155 x 73.9 x 7.8 mm | 157.8 x 72.3 x 8.6mm  **Weight** |  180 grams | 189 grams  **Display** |  6.1-inch OLED, 18.7:9 ratio, DCI-P3, HDR, Full HD+ (2240 x1080) display | 6.39-inch curved OLED,  19.5:9, DCI-P3, HDR,  WQHD+ (3120 x 1440) display  **Processor** |  Kirin 970 | Kirin 980  **RAM** |  6GB/8GB | 6GB  **Rear camera** |  40 + 20 (mono) + 8-megapixel triple camera | 40 + 20 (RGB)+ 8-megapixel triple camera  **Front camera** |  24-megapixel | 24-megapixel w/ depth sensing face unlock  **Battery** |  4000mAh | 4200mAh  **Software** |  Android 8.1 Oreo w/ EMUI 8.1 | Android 9.0 Pie w/ EMUI 9  **Storage** |  128GB/256GB.

Sadly, aside from greaterpeace of mind over the P20 Pro’s tech, the additional effort Huawei has madehere doesn’t grant the Mate 20 Pro the ability to authorise sensitive actionslike purchases or let you log into banking apps using the sensor. Suchfunctionality will only come about if developers make use of the sensor’sspecific APIs, and right now, that seems unlikely.There’s a whopping 4000mAh battery inside the P20 Pro. It offers some of thebest battery life of any flagship currently on the market and what’s more, itfeatures respectably rapid 22.5W [fastcharging](https://www.trustedreviews.com/how-to/what-is-fast-charging-3521693). Like so many aspects of the Mate 20 Pro, it takes all ofthese great aspects from the P20 Pro and improves upon them.Not only does the phone sport a larger 4200mAh power pack, but it’s also thefirst of the company’s phones to debut even more rapid 40W SuperCharge fastcharging and it’s the first of Huawei’s phones to integrate wireless charging.The company didn’t skip either, granting the Mate 15W fast wireless chargingand, in an industry first, wireless reverse charging – letting you juiceanother Qi-enabled smartphone (such as an [iPhoneXS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xs) or [Samsung GalaxyS9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9)) wire-free.**Related:[Best Wireless Charger](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-wireless-charger-3505891)**Both phones’ primary triple camera arrays might sound the same on paper butHuawei has switched things up with its newer phone. While the resolutionremains unchanged, the company is now confident that its new Matrix Camerasystem takes good enough shots that it can do away with the secondarymonochrome sensor used by the likes of the P20 Pro. Instead, the Mate 20 Probenefits from an ultra-wide angle 20-megapixel secondary RGB sensor that letsyou capture even wider shots and take macro images as close as 2.5cms fromyour subject.What’s more, the beefier processor lets you capture markedly smoother 4K videoat 30 frames per second, along with new filtered shooting modes that add real-time effects to footage such as colour pop.**Related:[Best Phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-smartphone-3431175)**## Mate 20 Pro vs P20 Pro: How much more expensive is the new Huawei?The Huawei P20 Pro may have only been out five months but its flagship pricehas already fallen to a more approachable €640/£669.
