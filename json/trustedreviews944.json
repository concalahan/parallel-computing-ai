And our one to avoid is a smart toothpick\ndispenser that really sets our teeth on edge.\n\n**Related:[We all secretly want a robot butler – and Big-i is the\nanswer](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/big-i-is-a-robot-butler-for-\nthe-home-and-this-week-s-featured-kickstarter)**\n\n## What is AER?\n\n![aer\nrender](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIt might look like one of those [toy rockets](https://www.amazon.co.uk/NERF-\nVortex-Aero-Howler-Colours/dp/B000F490LG) that makes a whistling sound when\nyou throw it, but it’s actually a housing for your GoPro. Lug it up into the\nair, and your GoPro will record video or take photos during its trajectory.\n\n## Why is it interesting?\n\nBecause it’s a fun, cheap alternative to a drone. Drones need flying\nexpertise, and charging, and if they break, you’ll be out of pocket to the\ntune of hundreds of pounds. Plus, you’re not allowed to fly them anywhere near\neven lightly populated areas.\n\nAER, however, is more like a toy.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\n![aer\nfootball](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIts foam bumper is designed to take a few knocks, and provides ample\nprotection for your camera. It’s easy to use, too. Put your GoPro into the\nhead, slide the wings together, then screw them into the head – that’s it.\nThere’s no charging or calibrating required.\n\nIt’s designed specifically with GoPro in mind, fitting the [GoPro\nHero3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/gopro-hero3-black-edition-review),\n[4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/gopro-hero4-black-review) and the recently\nlaunched [5](https://www.trustedreviews.com/gopro-hero5-review). (The 5\nfeatures voice control too, so you can starting filming mid-flight just by\nspeaking.)\n\nIt’s streamlined, and its weight distribution will help it fly further than\nyou’ve ever thrown. It certainly seems to be flying far in the promo video.\nEither that or it was launched from a canon.\n\n**Related:[CCROV is the world’s first underwater 4K\ndrone](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/ccrov-the-world-s-first-\nunderwater-4k-drone-makes-a-splash-as-our-featured-kickstarter)**\n\nWith the camera in the head, it’ll always fly straight, so you won’t end up\nwith any vomit-inducing twirly videos. It floats, is waterproof, and won’t\nsmash if it crashes. It even comes with its own bag for carrying it around.\nThere’s room in the bag for your GoPro gear, too. They’ve thought of\neverything.\n\nBurst mode takes lots of shots in quick succession, so you’re bound to get one\nyou like.\n\nObviously it can’t record ‘proper’ flight videos like a drone. But for the\nprice, the versatility (you won’t get arrested for using it near a public\nbuilding) and the fun factor, we’re happy to forgive that.\n\n## What are the challenges?\n\n![aer\nthrow](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe usual caveat applies. Crowdfunding inherently entails an element of risk.\nYour money doesn’t guarantee you a product, but goes towards financing the\nproduction of the product. All things being well, yours will be delivered as\nadvertised, but it’s not set in stone. Which is worth bearing in mind before\nyou back a project.\n\n**Related:[Sgnl is the sci-fi gadget of your\ndreams](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/why-you-should-back-sgnl-a-\nwatch-strap-that-turns-your-finger-into-a-phone)**\n\nThere are no moving parts involved in AER, so fingers crossed production\nshould go relatively smoothly. In fact, there aren’t many parts to it, and\nthey’re all manufactured in its native Netherlands. The firm promises it can\nrespond quickly, should problems arise, to minimise delay.\n\nA limited run should ship in January, followed by a full run in February.\n\n## Is there anything similar available?\n\n![aer\nwater](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nNot that we’ve seen. Drones are becoming more affordable though, so some\npeople might be happy to pay a bit more for the extra features. But as we’ve\nalready said, it’s not trying to be a drone.\n\n**Related:[The Wolfe makes your laptop VR-ready on the\ncheap](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/why-you-should-back-the-wolfe-and-\nbring-virtual-reality-skills-to-your-macbook)**\n\nOf course most action cameras are robust enough to survive being thrown\nwithout any protective housing, but they won’t fly anywhere near as well as\nAER.\n\n## Should I crowdfund this?\n\nIf it’s aerial shots you’re after, but don’t want to spend a lot, then yes.\nPlay catch with it on the beach, and when you’re done you’ll have some pretty\nawesome videos and photos to look through.\n\n![aer\nsundown](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe €39 (£34) super early birds are all sold out, but there are plenty left of\nthe €49 (£43) models.\n\n## And one to avoid this week\n\n[World’s First Smart Toothpick\nDispenser](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/world-s-first-smart-toothpick-\ndispenser#/). At last! Just what we’ve been waiting for – an automated\ntoothpick dispenser.\n\nYes, you’ll wonder how you ever lived without being offered a toothpick by a\nlittle white box. The point is to avoid sharing germs, but you’re better off\njust buying your own toothpicks and saving the $50.\n\nEvery backer will also be offered the first production units of the Smart Tic\nTac Dispenser, which will arrive next year. Really, what’s wrong with a\nstandard packet of Tic Tacs?\n\n**Watch The Refresh: The best tech gossip and reviews every week  \n**\n\n****\n\nLet us know if you decide to back AER in the comments.\n\n"}
