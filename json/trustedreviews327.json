Splash-resistant rivals compared | Trusted Reviews", "description": "![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nPhones with waterproofing are becoming increasingly common, with almost every\ncurrent high-end phone coming with some form of protection from accidental\ntoilet tumbles, pint dunkage and pool party plunges.\n\nThe upcoming iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max are water-resistant, earning the IP\n(Ingress Protection) 68 rating, while the iPhone XR is IP67 rated.\n\nAccording to the IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) which came up\nwith Standard 60529 – better known as the IP Code – a two-digit number ending\nin a ‘7’ means that a device has can withstand half an hour of immersion in\ndepths of up to a metre, while a number ending in an ‘8’ means the device can\nhandle half an hour in depths greater than a metre.\n\nNote that there’s no defined limit for an ‘8’ rating, but manufacturers have\nto specify the exact depths at which their devices are tested – in Apple’s\ncase, both the iPhone XS and XS Max have been shown to prevent water ingress\nat depths of up to two metres over half an hour.\n\nNone of this necessarily means that you should go swimming with your new\nphone, mind. Apple says that liquid damage isn’t covered under the warranties\nfor its new phones, which is standard practice across the industry. But if you\ndon’t fancy shelling out for one of Apple’s most expensive phones yet, what\nare your alternatives? Take a look at our list of water-resistant phones\nbelow.\n\n**Related:[IP67 vs 68 – Water proofing\nexplained](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/what-is-ip68-ip-ratings-\nexplained-2947135)**\n\n## iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max – IP68-rated\n\nBoth the new iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max are IP68-rated, meaning they can\nsurvive being dropped in depths of up to two metres for half an hour.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n## iPhone XR – IP67-rated\n\nThe new iPhone XR is IP67-rated, so it’s protected against spending half an\nhour in up to 1 metre of water.\n\n## iPhone 8, 8 Plus and X – IP67-rated\n\nLike the last generation, all of Apple’s new phones are rated to survive in 1m\nof water for 30 minutes.\n\n##\n\niPhone 7 and 7 Plus – IP67-rated\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: Apple\n\nLast year’s iPhones were the first Apple handsets to be waterproof. Apple had\nbeen rather behind the curve for a few years, but given the number of its\nhigh-end Android rivals that have had water-proofing for a few years, it was\ntime for the company up catch up.\n\n**Related:[Everything we know about the iPhone\nX](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-x-release-date-specs-features-\nuk-price-2951157)**\n\n## Samsung Galaxy Note 8, S8 and S8+ – IP68-rated\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: Max Parker / Trusted Reviews\n\nLike most of the other phones on this list, Samsung’s top-end 2017 phones all\ncome with a high degree of dust- and water-proofing. The 5.8-inch\n[S8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s8), 6.2-inch\n[S8+](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s8-plus) and\n6.3-inch [Note 8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-\nnote-8) can all be submerged in up to 1.5m of water for up to 30 minutes.\n\n**Related:[iPhone 9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-9-release-\ndate-specs-features-price-rumours-uk-3297160)**\n\n## Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge – IP68-rated\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIf you fancy saving some cash, 2016’s 7-series of Samsung phones are water-\nproof in 1m of water for 30 minutes.\n\n## LG G6 and V30 – IP68-rated\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nLG’s in on the act as well, with its 2017 flagship phones getting the IP68\nrating for submersion in water up to 1.5m. Both the 5.7-inch\n[G6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/lg-g6) and 6-inch\n[V30](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/lg-v30) are ready to dive in.\n\n## HTC U11 – IP68-rated\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nHTC’s squeezable phone is also dunkable.

In Moto’s own words it’s ready for “moderate\nexposure to water such as accidental spills, splashes or light rain”.\n\n## Sony Xperia XZ1, XZ1 Compact and more – various IP ratings\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSony’s 2017 flagships big and small get the full IP68 rating, but Sony is one\nof the most consistent manufacturers when it comes to waterproof phones. In\nfact, dating back several years, the company’s phones have had varying levels\nof waterproofing, although some of its older models required rubber bungs\ninside charging ports in order to become fully water-proof. If you’re after a\nwater-resistant bargain as perhaps a phone for taking on holiday, a Z3 or Z3\nCompact would be a great choice.\n\n"}
