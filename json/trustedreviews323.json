There’s the Nokia 7+, the Nokia 8 Sirocco and the remake\nof the 8110.\n\nLike the 3310 from last year, the 8110 is a feature phone with ambitions of\ntapping into people’s nostalgia. It’s not trying to get people to switch from\na smartphone, instead looking to act as a secondary device.\n\nYou can read all about the [Nokia\n8110](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nokia-8110-4g) in our full first\nlook, but here’s a short version: It looks a lot like a banana, still features\na slide-out cover to protect the keyboard and actually ships with 4G support.\nIt can be used as a hotspot to connect other devices and Nokia claims its\nbattery life will last 20 days. It’ll ship for around 79 euros in May.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nBut Nokia has more up its sleeve than just the 8110.\n\n## **Nokia 6 (2018) first look**\n\nFirst released last year, the 6 sat at the top of HMD’s Nokia line until the\nNokia 8 came to be. It was an ok device, but one that lacked power.\n\nThankfully Nokia seems to have taken that criticism onboard and has quickly\nupdated the Nokia 6 for 2018. The biggest change is the new processor, which\nis now a Snapdragon 660. Nokia claimed this will give you an 80% performance\nboost.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThe fingerprint scanner has been pushed to the back and whole design feels a\nbit classier with diamond cut edges and some nice colour options.\n\n**Related:[Best budget\nphone](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/trustedreviews-awards-2010-best-\nbudget-mobile-phone-page-24)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nZeiss has now helped with the camera, though we didn’t have much opportunity\nto see what exactly was new, and USB-C is now the port of choice on the\nbottom.\n\nThe New Nokia 6 will also use [Android\nOne](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/what-is-android-one-2924502) as\nits operating system of choice – giving you guarantee updates and security\npatches.

This is a\nbasic device that’ll cost around 85 euros when it’s released in April. It’s\ncheap, but there are some good features like an IPS display, 4G support and\nyou can swap the covers to alter the look of the back.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIt runs a basic version of Android called Go which minimises application size\nto get the most from the 512MB RAM. A micro USB port sits on the bottom for\ncharging and there’s 8GB storage along with a 5-megapixel rear camera and\n2-megapixel selfie one. It’s basic stuff, but that’s the point.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nHMD and the Nokia brand had a big year in 2017 and with the amount of devices\nit’s launching at MWC 2017 it’s looking like it’ll the same this time around.\nStay tuned to _Trusted Reviews_ for reviews of all the devices above.\n\n**Which Nokia phone excites you the most?
