You get many of the same features for\na fraction of the price, and that makes it hugely compelling.\n\n## Pros\n\n  * Great value\n  * Slim and light, yet powerful\n  * Apple Pencil compatible\n  * iOS is the best tablet operating system\n\n## Cons\n\n  * Reflective screen\n  * Average rear camera\n\n## Key Features\n\n  * Review Price: £319\n  * 9.7-inch IPS LCD screen\n  * A10 Fusion processor with 2GB RAM\n  * 8MP rear and 1.2MP front cameras\n  * Apple Pencil compatible (sold separately)\n  * 32 & 128GB models available\n  * 4G and Wi-Fi-only models available\n  * Silver, Gold and Space Grey colour options\n  * Weighs 469g (478g for 4G version)\n\n## **What is the 9.7-inch iPad 2018?**\n\nThe new iPad 2018 is the cheapest tablet in Apple’s range, and it looks just\nlike any other iPad from the past five years.\n\nIt should be boring. But it isn’t. It packs the powerful A10 Fusion processor,\ncosts just £319/$329 (for the entry-level 32GB Wi-Fi model) and it supports\nthe Apple Pencil. This is an iPad Pro mini in all but name, but is half the\nprice of the [10.5-inch iPad Pro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/ipad-\npro).\n\nWhat’s more, forget cheap laptops; Apple is pitching the iPad 2018 as the\nfuture of computing in the classroom – and there’s certainly some truth to its\nclaim.\n\n**Related:[iPhone 9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-9-release-\ndate-3297160) | [iPhone XS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-xs-\nrelease-date-3551351)**\n\nThe upgraded processor means you’ll see a significant improvement over any\niPad older than the iPad Air 2. If you’re rocking an old iPad that’s sluggish\nand doesn’t last long on a charge, then this is the time to upgrade without\nbreaking the bank.\n\nThe new iPad is thin, light and has a sharp, punchy 9.7-inch screen that’s\nperfect for watching video in bed or on the go. Battery life is solid,\noffering between 10 and 11 hours of screen time. Playing games reduces this a\nlittle, while low-intensity tasks such as browsing the web and sending emails\nresults in it lasting even longer.\n\nAs a casual tablet, the new iPad is the best you can get for the price. As a\nfull-on laptop replacement, things aren’t quite so simple, but the iPad still\nmakes a solid case for itself.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n## **iPad 2018 – Design and screen**\n\nIf you’ve seen an iPad at any point in the past few years then the 2018 model\nwon’t surprise you at all.\n\nThere’s the solid metal chassis, a chunky bezel around the screen and a proper\nHome button with Touch ID. It’s thin, light and great to hold.\n\nThe IPS 9.7-inch screen isn’t quite on a par with the one on the [iPad\nPro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/ipad-pro-12-9-inch), but it’s\nstill great for anything other than the most detailed of design or photo- and\nvideo-editing work. It isn’t as rich in colour as the OLED-packing [Samsung\nGalaxy Tab 3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/galaxy-tab-s3), but\ncolours are accurate and dark levels decent for an LCD screen. The one\ndownside is that it’s quite reflective and smudges easily with fingermarks.\n\n**Related:[Best tablets](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\ntablet-3438986)**\n\n![9.7-inch iPad\n2018](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg) The stereo speakers are fine for watching video,\nbut not a patch on the iPad Pro’s quad-speaker array. They lack bass and depth\nfor listening to music.\n\nData transfer and charging is handled via a Lightning port, and a 3.5mm\nheadphone jack remains – something that’s disappeared from recent\niPhones.![9.7-inch iPad\n2018](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe screen also not supports the pressure-sensitive Apple Pencil, giving you\nsuperb precision when drawing. You can also sketch, take notes, mark up\ndocuments or photos, or even use it as you would a mouse pointer.\n\nThe Apple Pencil is fast, smooth, and a really useful tool that you still\ndon’t find on many laptops. Those hybrid laptops that do support a stylus,\nsuch as the [Microsoft Surface\nPro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/surface-pro), are rarely cheap.\nThe only direct tablet competitor is the £500 Galaxy Tab S3, which comes with\nan S Pen stylus in the box. At £89, the Apple Pencil adds a heap of useful\nfeatures to the new iPad whilst keeping the price well below Samsung’s tab.\n\n![9.7-inch iPad 2018 Apple\nPencil](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nI’m no artist. Apologies to Matt Groening…\n\nSo the only thing that’s really lacking when comparing this iPad to the\n[10.5-inch iPad Pro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/ipad-pro) is the\nsmart keyboard connector. If the iPad wants to be a realistic alternative to a\nlaptop then it needs a keyboard. Typing remains a key part of being productive\nin the office or classroom, and this isn’t going to change any time soon. So\nthe lack of keyboard connector is a big deal, right?\n\nI don’t think so. I’ve been happily using an iPad with a Bluetooth keyboard\nsince the iPad 3 launched six years ago. Sure, there’s a little lag compared\nto a keyboard attached via the smart connector, but it’s still quite usable.\n\nThere are dozens of Bluetooth keyboard cases that range in quality and price,\nand these make the iPad a solid tool for writing emails, essays or just having\nsome ‘civilised debates’ on forums. An on-screen keyboard just doesn’t hack\nit.\n\n![9.7-inch iPad 2018\nkeyboard](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)The quality of the keyboard makes all the\ndifference. Some cheap keyboards don’t feel great; others add too much bulk.\nWe’ll be reviewing some options soon. I’ve been testing this new iPad with an\nold Typo Bluetooth keyboard designed for the iPad Air. It fits (just), so if\nyou do have an old keyboard case then you might be able to reuse it.\n\nDo note that iPad Air 2 cases won’t fit this new iPad. That tablet was paper-\nthin.\n\n## **iPad 2018 – iOS 11 software and multi-tasking**\n\nThe iPad was hamstrung for years by iOS. Apple’s operating system favoured\nsmaller-screen devices for a long time. iOS 9 brought with it split-view\nmulti-tasking, which was crucial, but it wasn’t until iOS 11, late in 2017,\nthat the iPad got the love it deserved.\n\n![iPad 2018 persistent\ndock](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe dock is great for accessing most-used apps\n\niOS 11 introduced a brand-new interface for the iPad, with a persistent dock\nfor most-used apps, as well as a proper app switcher and a revamped Control\nCenter. It also increased the Pencil’s functionality, so you can now write and\ndraw inline in Mail and Notes. Even better, the iPad can now recognise your\nhandwriting, so you can search your written notes for keywords.\n\n![9.7-inch iPad\n2018](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe new Control Center is customisable\n\nThese are the changes that really make a difference to viewing the iPad as a\ntrue laptop replacement and productivity workhorse.\n\nThen there are Pages, Numbers and Keynote. These are Apple’s take on Microsoft\nOffice, except they’re free. They’re arguably more powerful than Google’s free\ncloud apps, but if, like me, you’re hooked on Google, then those are available\ntoo, as is Microsoft Office.\n\n## **iPad 2018 – Performance and features**\n\nApple keeps touting the 2018 iPad as more powerful than most laptops. How can\nthat be true? How can a device that weighs a few hundred grams and is just\n7.5mm thick compete with full-on laptops?\n\nWell, if you’ve spent almost £1000 on a laptop recently then you shouldn’t\nworry – you haven’t been mugged. It will be more powerful and be able to do\nmore than the iPad.\n\nThe truth is that it’s very hard to compare performance between a laptop\nrunning macOS, Chrome or Windows and an iPad. There are some benchmark tests,\nsuch as Geekbench 4, which work across platforms and give an indication of\ncomparative performance.\n\nThe iPad 2018 emerges looking great using the Geekbench yardstick, thanks to\nits A10 Fusion processor and 2GB of RAM powering the lighter operating system.\nSingle-core performance is a particular highlight. This is important, since\nmost apps still utilise only one core at a time.\n\nI’ve compared it here to last year’s iPad, the iPad Pro with A10X processor,\nand 2016 Intel i3, i5 and i7 mobile processors packed into most laptops\ncosting £400-£700.\n\n| **Geekbench 4 Single** | **Performance Difference**  \n---|---|---  \n**iPad 2018** | **3525** | **N/A**  \niPad 2017 | 2523 | 40%  \niPad Pro | 3908 | -10%  \ni3-7100U | 2855 | 23%  \ni5-7200U | 3288 | 7%  \ni7-7500U | 3926 | -10%  \n  \nGeekbench shows that the A10 outperforms the i3 significantly and the i5\nslightly when it comes to single-core performance. In multicore, where both\ncores are used, Intel manages to claw back some ground.\n\n| **Geekbench 4 Multi** | **Performance Difference**  \n---|---|---  \n**iPad 2018** | **5972** | **N/A**  \niPad 2017 | 4380 | 36%  \niPad Pro | 9305 | -36%  \ni3-7100U | 5501 | 9%  \ni5-7200U | 6378 | -6%  \ni7-7500U | 7594 | -21%  \n  \nCross-platform benchmarking is a tricky measurement and shouldn’t be trusted\nas a sole indicator of performance. A more useful way assessment of\nperformance is to use a similarly priced laptop to run the same tasks: edit\nimages and video, multitask, and play games, for example.\n\nHere, again, the iPad comes up smelling of roses. The hardware and apps are so\nwell optimised to iOS that even highly intensive tasks such as editing images\nand video run more quickly than they would on a £300-400 Windows laptop. A\nChromebook won’t pass muster either, but that’s more because Chrome apps are\nstill rather lacking compared to the wealth of the Apple App Store.\n\nEditing out an undesirable in a photo of everyone’s favourite redhead is\ninstant on the iPad using the Apple Pencil and the Pixelmator app. A 2014\nMacBook Air with an Intel Core i7 and 8GB of RAM has a delay of several\nseconds using Photoshop for the same task. The results are also better on the\niPad.\n\n![Pixelmator iPad 2018 Ed\nSheeran](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nEditing out an unwanted person from a photo using Pixelmator is instant on the\niPad, and this result was after just one pass. Just a little weird duplication\nat the bottom right that needs fixing\n\nThese tests aren’t like for like. I’m not using the same software, but I am\nseeking the same end result. Editing Full HD video in iMovie is just as slick,\nand faster than on the old MacBook too.\n\nSo when it comes to getting things done, clearly the new iPad can compete.\nWhen it comes to replacing a full-fat Windows laptop, things become more\ncomplex.\n\nPower users will miss the multi-tasking abilities of a proper PC. Dragging\nmultiple windows around and having lots of items open on a single screen can\nbe handy. So is a larger screen and keyboard. Regardless of how much sharper\nthe 9.7-inch screen is compared to a similarly priced laptop, the keyboard\ncase is small and a little cramped for my hands.\n\nCompare it to a Chromebook and the iPad fares better. For starters, the app\necosystem is so much richer. The screen is also sharper than anything you’ll\nfind on a £400 Google-powered laptop.\n\n![Asus Chromebook Flip\nC100PA](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nWhat is missing, however, is a touchpad. A touchpad is a great way of\nnavigating a laptop, so on the iPad you’ll need to use your fingers and the\nscreen, or pick up the Apple Pencil for better precision. You get used to the\nlack of cursor, but it’s still some way from using a touchpad.\n\nSo here’s the rub. The iPad does work as a laptop replacement _if_ you buy a\ndecent keyboard case with which to use it. That ups the price to around £400\nfor the entry-level model. I’d also prefer a larger keyboard and touchpad in\nthe long run, simply because I write so much.\n\nThe size is a benefit when it comes to children, though. Where an iPad\nkeyboard can feel restrictive to an adult, it’s ideal for smaller fingers, and\nalso light enough for kids to carry around. Apple’s courting of schools and\neducation establishments really does make a lot of sense.\n\nThe 2018 iPad comes in 32GB (for £319/$329) and 128GB (for £409/$439)\nversions, with no option to expand later, so choose wisely. You can also get\nthe 4G version for an extra £130 – a high premium.\n\n## **iPad 2018 – Camera**\n\nThe 8-megapixel camera on the rear of the iPad takes acceptable photos in good\nlight, but is average at best. Photos are flat and can be overexposed. In low-\nlight conditions they’re packed with noise. I’d hoped this would be improved\nover the previous model, but the narrow f/2.4 aperture remains – and it just\ndoesn’t cut it anymore; you can get better pics from some £150 phones.\n\n![9.7-inch iPad\n2018](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nHowever, you do get [Live Photos](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/how-\ndoes-live-photos-work-on-iphone-6s-2929670), which makes a mini-movie out of\nevery image, and the camera shoots Full HD video. It’s perfectly adequate for\nschool projects, but you won’t want to use it to capture cherished memories.\n\nThe camera isn’t just there for snaps, however. Apple is investing in\naugmented reality, but the iPad isn’t the best showcase for\n[ARkit](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/what-is-apple-arkit-3286676). It\nstruggles to find surfaces it can ‘project’ on, and when it does it can be\njittery, making you lose focus. AR remains a bit of a gimmick on the iPad, but\nit will keep kids happy for a short while.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIf Apple is serious about AR then it needs to pack a 3D sensor or dual cameras\non the rear of the iPad to make the experience slicker and more immersive.\n\nThe 2018 iPad also comes with 1.2-megapixel Facetime HD camera, which works\nwell for video-calling.\n\n## **iPad 2018 – Battery life**\n\nThe 9.7-inch iPad lasts just as long as previous models. That means it’s\nsolid, but doesn’t reach the dizzying heights of newer Ultrabooks, such as the\nnew [Dell XPS 13](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/dell-xps-13) with its\nmammoth 20-hour quoted battery life. Of course, prices for that awesome laptop\nstart at £1249.\n\nThe iPad 2018 offers around 11 hours of screen time at 50% brightness, which\nis more than enough for all but the busiest of days. An hour of 3D gaming\ntakes it down by 9%, while an hour of Netflix streaming over Wi-Fi cuts it by\n7%. Browsing the web consumes about the same amount of power as streaming.\n\nPlaying a video on repeat until the battery died gave me just shy of 11 hours,\nwhich is identical to last year’s model. If you use the iPad for only a few\nhours a day, you’ll get through a whole week before needing to charge it.\n\nThe iPad is brilliant on standby, losing only 1-2% per day, but charging still\ntakes a long time. Using the power adapter in the box gives you 25% after an\nhour; it takes four hours to fully charge the device.\n\n## **Why buy the iPad 2018?**\n\nThere are two main reasons to buy the new 9.7-inch iPad. The first is because\nyou already have an iPad that you love, but it’s old and tired. If that’s the\ncase then you won’t be disappointed by this reinvigorated model.\n\nThe second reason is because you’re considering buying a cheap laptop and you\nthink the iPad might be a better fit.\n\nIf you need oodles of physical connectivity such as SD card readers, HDMI\noutputs and USB ports, the iPad won’t work for you. If, however, you want a\nslick device that’s as comfortable streaming movies as it is editing photos\nand videos, as well as being a budget graphics tablet, then it’s a great bet.\n\nDon’t forget, however: you’ll need a keyboard case and the Apple Pencil to\nmake the most of it. I’d budget an extra £150 for both.\n\nThis new iPad also makes more sense than the iPad mini 4, unless you’re dead\nset on a small tablet. It’s a lot more powerful and has a bigger screen, but\nonly costs an extra £10/$30 for the matching 128GB model.\n\n**Read next:[Best laptops](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nlaptops-3431966)**\n\n## **Verdict**\n\nThe new iPad is an iPad Pro on a budget. You get many of the same features for\na fraction of the price, and that makes it hugely compelling.\n\n## Score\n\n  \n\n"}
