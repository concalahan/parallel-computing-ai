Samsung's new Exynos 9810 chip reveals a lot", "description": "![galaxys8\n25](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Samsung has taken the wraps off its new-gen Exynos 9810 processor, which\nlikely power variants of the rumoured**[Galaxy\nS9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s9-release-date-specs-\nfeatures-price-uk-3266552) **and Galaxy S9 Plus – and it certainly sounds like\nit’s going to give Qualcomm’s all-new Snapdragon 845 chipset a run for its\nmoney.**\n\nBuilt using Samsung’s second-generation 10-nanometer FinFET fabrication\nprocess, the Exynos 9810 features an octa-core setup – four high-performance\nand four low-energy cores – as well as a standalone security management unit\nthat’s complete with an enhanced face-tracking engine for improved face\nrecognition.\n\nIn layman’s terms, this means the Exynos 9810 will arm the Galaxy S9 – and\nGalaxy S9 Plus – with a couple of the [iPhone\nX](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-x)‘s most-loved features,\nincluding Animoji and [Face ID](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/what-is-\nface-id-3286453). It could also put it on par with Apple’s flagship in the\npower department, thanks to the chip’s power conservation technology.\n\n**Related:[Snapdragon\n845](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/snapdragon-845-phones-benchmark-\nspeeds-release-date-camera-quick-charge-4-3350708)**\n\nMoreover, the Exynos 9810 is [equipped](https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-\noptimizes-premium-exynos-9-series-9810-ai-applications-richer-multimedia-\ncontent/) with the industry’s first Cat. 18 LTE modem for faster data\ntransmission (up to 1.2Gbps); a dedicated imaging processing unit capable of\nshooting 4K Ultra HD video at an eye-watering 120fps; and last, but not least,\ndeep learning-based (AI) software.\n\nWhichever way you slice it, the [Exynos\n9810](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/dont-believe-hype-galaxy-s9-plus-\nhasnt-surfaced-geekbench-3332954) looks like a significant step up from last\nyear’s Exynos 8895, though obviously we’ll have to wait until we get our hands\non the S9 later in the year to see how it holds up in the real world.\n\nProcessor aside, the Galaxy S9 is expected to ship with a 5.8-inch Infinity\nDisplay, at least 6GB of RAM and AKG-tuned stereo speakers, while the Galaxy\nS9 Plus should pack near-identical internals, though it’ll reportedly benefit\nfrom a slightly larger 6.2-inch screen, a dual-camera (12MP + 12MP) and a\nbeefier battery.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nAnother reason to consider upgrading to the Galaxy S9 from the [Galaxy\nS8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s8) – or waiting for\nthe S9, if you’re on an older Samsung phone – is that the rear fingerprint\nsensor is likely to be repositioned to just below the camera sensor. The S8\nexcelled nearly across the board last year, but many were irked by the\nannoying placement of said sensor next to the device’s primary snapper.\n\n### Best Samsung Galaxy S9 Deals\n\n[](https://public.eagleapi.io/magpie/time-inc/trusted-\nreviews/AUTO/link?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.awin1.com%2Fcread.php%3Fawinaffid%3D277673%26awinmid%3D380%26clickref%3Dtr-\nnewmobiledeals-s9%26p%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%252Fextras%253Ftariffcode%253DDD1YMFEB18%2526giftcode%253DNA16%2526productcode%253DVODSMGAS9BLA&clickref=flamingo&referrer=https://cms.trustedreviews.com/deals/samsung-\ngalaxy-s9-deals-3402357)\n\n[](https://public.eagleapi.io/magpie/time-inc/trusted-\nreviews/AUTO/link?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.awin1.com%2Fcread.php%3Fawinaffid%3D277673%26awinmid%3D380%26clickref%3Dtr-\nnewmobiledeals-s9%26p%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%252Fextras%253Ftariffcode%253DDD1YMFEB18%2526giftcode%253DNA16%2526productcode%253DVODSMGAS9BLA&clickref=flamingo&referrer=https://cms.trustedreviews.com/deals/samsung-\ngalaxy-s9-deals-3402357)\n\n###\n\n[Samsung Galaxy S9 – 4GB data on Vodafone (use code TRUSTED10 to save £10)\n\n](https://public.eagleapi.io/magpie/time-inc/trusted-\nreviews/AUTO/link?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.awin1.com%2Fcread.php%3Fawinaffid%3D277673%26awinmid%3D380%26clickref%3Dtr-\nnewmobiledeals-s9%26p%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%252Fextras%253Ftariffcode%253DDD1YMFEB18%2526giftcode%253DNA16%2526productcode%253DVODSMGAS9BLA&clickref=flamingo&referrer=https://cms.trustedreviews.com/deals/samsung-\ngalaxy-s9-deals-3402357)\n\nIf you don't need a lot of data and want to cut your monthly cost right down,\nthis is a great choice with a low overall TCO.\n\n[Mobiles.co.uk\n\n](https://public.eagleapi.io/magpie/time-inc/trusted-\nreviews/AUTO/link?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.awin1.com%2Fcread.php%3Fawinaffid%3D277673%26awinmid%3D380%26clickref%3Dtr-\nnewmobiledeals-s9%26p%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%252Fextras%253Ftariffcode%253DDD1YMFEB18%2526giftcode%253DNA16%2526productcode%253DVODSMGAS9BLA&clickref=flamingo&referrer=https://cms.trustedreviews.com/deals/samsung-\ngalaxy-s9-deals-3402357)\n\n|\n\n£150 upfront w/code\n\n|\n\nNow £23pm\n\n[View Deal](https://public.eagleapi.io/magpie/time-inc/trusted-\nreviews/AUTO/link?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.awin1.com%2Fcread.php%3Fawinaffid%3D277673%26awinmid%3D380%26clickref%3Dtr-\nnewmobiledeals-s9%26p%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%252Fextras%253Ftariffcode%253DDD1YMFEB18%2526giftcode%253DNA16%2526productcode%253DVODSMGAS9BLA&clickref=flamingo&referrer=https://cms.trustedreviews.com/deals/samsung-\ngalaxy-s9-deals-3402357)\n\nNow £23pm\n\n|\n\n£150 upfront w/code\n\n|\n\n[Mobiles.co.uk\n\n](https://public.eagleapi.io/magpie/time-inc/trusted-\nreviews/AUTO/link?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.awin1.com%2Fcread.php%3Fawinaffid%3D277673%26awinmid%3D380%26clickref%3Dtr-\nnewmobiledeals-s9%26p%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%252Fextras%253Ftariffcode%253DDD1YMFEB18%2526giftcode%253DNA16%2526productcode%253DVODSMGAS9BLA&clickref=flamingo&referrer=https://cms.trustedreviews.com/deals/samsung-\ngalaxy-s9-deals-3402357)\n\n**Are you excited about the upcoming Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9 Plus?
