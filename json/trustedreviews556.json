All\nof that should make 4K video streaming an absolute doddle.\n\nIn addition to ChromeOS apps, the box will also be able to run Android apps\nfrom the Google Play store, massively increasing the amount of available\nsoftware, as well as offering a much better offline experience.\n\n## Asus Chromebox 3 price\n\nThere are several different models of Asus Chromebox 3, each equipped with\ndifferent hardware and retailing for radically different prices.\n\nPrices start at a reasonable £249.99 for a box that’s packing an Intel Celeron\n3865U, 4GB of RAM, and a 32GB M.2 SSD.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nStepping up to £449.99 model gets you an i3-7100U CPU, and 64GB of storage.\n\nThe £569.99 Chromebox 3 ups the CPU from an i3 to an i5-8250U, bumps the RAM\nto 8GB, and increases the total storage to 128GB.\n\nAt the top of the range you can expect an Intel Core i7-8550U, 16GB of RAM and\n256GB of storage. This would put the Chromebox 3 firmly into decent gaming PC\nterritory, were it not for the lack of a dedicated graphics card and an\noperating system that will run mobile games at best.\n\n**Related:[Best laptops](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-laptops)**\n\nWith specs like these the Chromebox 3 is shaping up to be a nice little\nmachine for light productivity work, as well as being a decent media streaming\nmachine.\n\nThe launch of the Chromebox 3 comes as Apple fans continue to hope for a new\nversion of the cult favourite Mac mini.\n\n[Back in October](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-mac-mini-may-not-\ndead-3311789), an email allegedly sent to a user saw Apple CEO Tim Cook pledge\nthe diminutive desktop was still “an important part of our product line going\nforward.” At the time, Cook reportedly said it wasn’t the right time to share\nmore details.\n\n**Would you consider the Chromebox 3 as a handy desktop companion?
