Most recently, there’s the small matter of the [Facebook and\nCambridge Analytica scandal](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/facebook-\ncambridge-analytica-scandal-latest-3428686), which is causing users to leave\nFacebook in droves. But there is an alternative. Our guide to Facebook’s\nprivacy settings explains all you need to know to keep using the popular\nsocial network safely.\n\nThe recent allegations that Facebook data was manipulated by UK-based\nCambridge Analytica to influence a range of world events from Donald Trump’s\nelection to the Brexit vote has shaken the technology world to its core.\n\nWhat’s a privacy-conscious social media user to do if they don’t want to\n[delete Facebook](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-delete-facebook-\naccount-2950145) entirely, but do want to secure their account from outside\nmeddling? Allow us to explain.\n\n**Related:[How to download your Facebook\ndata](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/download-my-facebook-data-\nembarrassing-discoveries-3429477)**\n\n## Facebook Privacy Settings: The basics explained\n\nThe entire Facebook/Cambridge Analytica affair highlights just how important\nit is to keep track of the apps you use − or have used in the past − that are\nconnected to your Facebook account through Facebook Login. This is because the\ndata was gathered through an app called ‘thisisyourdigitallife’, which allowed\npeople to log in to it using their Facebook account.\n\nYou can find a list of apps that have access to your Facebook data, such as\nyour name, pictures, birthday and friends list, on the App Settings page.\nThere’s a good chance the list will be significantly longer than expected.\n\nClicking each entry in the list shows you the types of data you’ve given them\npermission to access. By unchecking each box, you can limit how many of your\npersonal details they can get their hands on. You can also unlink the apps\nfrom your Facebook account on this page, by clicking the ‘X’ that appears next\nto them.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\n  * \n\nHowever, as Facebook’s FAQ notes, “The app or game may have stored info from\nwhen you were using it, but you can contact the developer to ask that they\ndelete any info they may still have.”\n\nYou can also switch off Facebook’s integration with apps completely, meaning\nyou won’t be able to log into apps, games and other websites using your\nFacebook account. To do this, go to Settings, Apps and Websites and Plugins,\nthen select Edit and Disable Platform.\n\nRaj Samani, chief scientist at McAfee, says that using your Facebook account\nto login to another app “bridges your digital islands, allowing the two\ncompanies to collect more data and build an in depth profile about you and\nyour activity.”\n\nHe recommends going even further to protect your data. “Set up a new login and\npassword for the apps you’re using. It may take a minute longer but it will\nhelp you to avoid data being shared between different services,” he told\n_Trusted Reviews_.\n\nNow that you understand the crux of the issue, here are 18 simple ways you can\nensure your Facebook privacy settings are exactly what you want them to be.\n\n**Related:[Best VPNs](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-vpn_round-up)**\n\n## 1) I want to…get an overview of my privacy settings\n\nFacebook’s privacy settings are spread over a number of portions of the site.\nHowever, you can do a quick health check by tapping the padlock to the right\nof the **Home** screen and selecting **Run Privacy Check Up**. This will allow\nyou see privacy settings at a glance over three key areas of Facebook\n\n1) **Posts** – As explained below, this will explain how to control your\nprivacy settings for every post.  \n2) **Apps** – Who sees your activity within third-party apps  \n3) **Profile** – Here you can limit what personal information (work, age,\ncontact details) is visible to who.\n\nThese are explained in more detail in the next three sections.\n\n## 2) I want to… control who sees my posts\n\nThis is perhaps the key privacy concern of Facebook users who’re concerned.\nNo-one wants their boss spying on their weekend activities, so it’s important\nto be clear about when you post. Whenever you upload a photo, fill in a\nstatus, or check in at a location there’s the opportunity to customise who you\nwish to share with. You can also adjust this by clicking the padlock and\nselecting **“Who can see my stuff?”**  \n**  \nThe three main options are:**\n\n  * **Friends** – Only people you’re friends with can see the post. If you’re posting photos of your children or any information you’d deem personal then this is what you need to select.\n  * **Public** – Anyone can see it whether they’re friends or not. If you want to be part of a public discussion to be seen by friends and within search; like on Twitter, then select this.\n  * **Only You** – Perhaps if you use Facebook as a repository for personal memories or a blog you can select Only You to ensure you, the account holder are the only one who sees it.\n\nHere you can also select **Custom** to add **Friends of Friends** to the list\nof people who can see the post while there’s also the opportunity to post only\nfor the eyes of various **Groups** you may be part of.\n\nIt is important to note that Facebook remembers the setting from your last\npost, so if your last post was a Public rant about X-Factor, remember that’ll\nbe the default setting next time.\n\n**Related:[How to post a GIF on Facebook](https://www.trustedreviews.com/how-\ntos/how-to-post-a-gif-on-facebook)**\n\n![Facebook\nprivacy](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## 3) I want to… control who sees my app activity\n\nYou’re likely to have many third-party services associated with Facebook,\nwhether they’re news services, fitness apps, games, other social networks,\nstreaming services or photo-sharing apps. Many become associated with your\nFacebook account by being installed on your smartphone, others by using\nFacebook Connect to create accounts. You can use the **Privacy Check Up** or\ngo to **Settings > Apps** and adjust who can see your activity or whether you\nwant to remove them completely by clicking the cross.\n\n![Facebook app\nsettings](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## 4) I want to… hide my personal information\n\nOver the years, Facebook has probably collected a tonne of personal\ninformation. Your email address, your birthday, political views, phone number,\nwhere you’ve studied, your sexual orientation, your political views, where\nyou’re from, where you’re worked, who you’re married to and who you’re related\nto.\n\nWith most employers now doing social media checks on potential employees, you\nmay want to shield some of this sensitive information. In the US for example,\nit’s still legal for employers to fire gay people.\n\nThankfully, much of this can be controlled via the **Privacy Check Up**\nmentioned above. You can alter who sees what by heading to the **About**\nsection of your profile and selecting **Edit** under each section. To alter\nprivacy settings from **Friends** to **Only Me** will hide the information\nfrom your profile. In many cases you may want to remove it completely by\nclicking the **X**.\n\n**Related:[How to delete Snapchat](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-\ndelete-snapchat-3393606)**\n\n![Facebook](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## 5) I want to… hide posts from other people\n\nIf you’re still friends with an ex on Facebook, it might be considered poor\nform to post photos of you in a new relationship in a place where he/she can\nsee them. You can get around this by hitting **Custom** from the “ **Who\nshould see this?** ” menu and tagging people you wish to hide the post from.\n\nThis is also a good way to prevent that outspoken friend embarrassing you by\ncommenting on a controversial subject.\n\n## 6) I want to… post something, but hide it from my timeline\n\nMaybe you have something to say and don’t want it as a permanent record on\nyour timeline, a thought, a meme, a joke in context that’s of its time, a\nphoto, etc. You can achieve this by ticking the **Hide From Timeline** box in\nthe post field.  \n**  \n**\n\n**Related:[Amazon Easter sale](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/amazon-\neaster-sale-uk-3425830)**\n\n![Gove\nCrush](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## 7) I want to… stop people sharing my photos and posts\n\nIf you’ve shared a photo or a status on Facebook, it’s open to be re-shared by\nthose who have access to it. That means **Friends** and, if you’ve tagged\npeople, **Friends of Friends**. If the post is **Public** then anyone in the\nworld can share it There’s no way around that, other than to set the post to\n**Only Me** in the first place, which kind of defeats the point in most cases.\n\n## 8) I want to… check what my Public profile looks like\n\nAs all profiles are now searchable within Facebook, you may want to check how\nyour profile looks to someone who stumbled upon it. To do this you can head to\n**Settings > Followers** and tap “ **Want to know what followers can see? View\nyour public Timeline**.” Here you can see how it looks to the **Public**. If\nyou spot information or posts you do not want to be public **Edit** the\nprivacy settings of individual posts or go to **Settings** to censor it from\nthe public.\n\nYou can also use this tool to see what a specific friend sees.\n\n## 9) I want to… change who can see old posts\n\nIn the early days of Facebook we were quite naïve with what we shared.\nThankfully, within **Settings > Privacy**, you can rectify some of your past\nprivacy mistakes. You can click **Limit Old Posts** , which will change any\nposts listed as **Public** or **Friends of Friends** and clicking **Confirm**\n, to ensure only **Friends** can see them. This can be undone at a later date.\n\n## 10) I want to… limit who can send me friend requests\n\nClick **Settings** > **Privacy** and head to “who can send me friend\nrequests.” You can change it from **Everybody** to **Friends of Friends** ,\nbut that’s about as far as you can go. This is also accessible form the\n**Privacy Shortcuts** accessed by clicking the padlock.\n\n**Related:[BlackBerry Priv review](https://www.trustedreviews.com/blackberry-\npriv-review)**\n\n![Shortcuts](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## 11) I want to… block someone\n\nThis one’s easy (and fun). Use the **Privacy Shortcuts** or go to **Settings >\nBlocking, **begin typing the name of the friend (or ex-friend) you wish to\nblock from your account. You can also block certain people from sending you\nmessages, but you have to be friends with them.\n\nIt’s also possible to block people people you’re not friends with by heading\nto their profile, clicking the “…” on the right hand side and selecting\n**Block.**\n\n![Facebook\nblock](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## 12) I want to… limit who can look me up through contact information\n\nFacebook probably has your phone number and some email addresses. If folks\n(i.e. potential employers, old flames, stalkers, etc.) were to enter these in\nsearch, they may be able to discover your profile. In Settings > Privacy you\ncan correct this by selecting either **Everyone** , **Friends of Friends** or\n**Friends**.\n\n## 13) I want… my Facebook page kept off Google\n\nThere’s no hiding from Facebook’s overarching Search engine, all you can do is\nlock down your privacy settings and hope you have a common name. However it’s\ndifferent in the case of other search engines like Google. Within **Settings >\nPrivacy**, you can ensure your Facebook profile is exempt by selecting **No**.\n\n## 14) I want to… hide my real name\n\nThe right to anonymity was and, in some cases, still is one of the most\ncherished tenets of the internet. With Facebook now showing all profiles\nwithin search results, changing to an assumed name seems a good idea for those\nwho don’t want to be discovered, have been harassed work in sensitive\nindustries, have been discriminated about etc…\n\nUnfortunately, it’s not that easy. Facebook makes you use your birth name when\nsigning up and has very strict rules about changing it thereafter. If you’re\nreported for a fake name it could suspend your account. The company has\nsoftened its stance following feedback from victims of abuse and the LGBTQ\ncommunity.\n\n**Related:[Best password manager](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-\npassword-manager_round-up)**\n\n## 15) I want to… protect my location\n\nFacebook loves it when you check into places, it gobbles up all of that lovely\ndata to attract advertisers. However, you may want to protect your location.\nThe very obvious step is not to click the location pin when posting.\n\nHowever, when you’re using the mobile app, Facebook may try to use GPS and Wi-\nFi to name your location. You can prevent this from happening by entering the\nLocation settings on your mobile device and denying Facebook access.\n\nIn iOS it goes: **Settings > Privacy > Location > Facebook > Never**\n\n## 16) I want to… prevent/remove a tag\n\nDown the years, our friends have tagged us in some damn awful stuff. Developed\nsocial media etiquette, and full knowledge of potential consequences, mean it\ndoesn’t happen so much these days. However help is at hand.\n\nIn Settings > Timeline and Tagging you can ask to review every tag before it\nappears on your or anyone else’s timeline.\n\nYou can always select Remove Tag within individual post settings. If the post\nis offensive, you can also Report Post if you want it off the site altogether.\n\n**Related:**[ **How to check your password strength**  \n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/password-strength-check-list-guide-safe-\nhack)\n\n## 17) I want to… make my profile completely private\n\nUntil last October, it was possible to hide your Facebook account, so it would\nnot show up within search. When the company broadened its Universal Search\nthrough the Knowledge Graph initiative, it no longer became an option.\n\nNow, even if your privacy settings are completely locked down you’ll appear\nwithin search results. There’s still information people can glean from that,\nsuch as the profile picture, your list of friends and the pages you’ve liked.\nNo way around it, sadly.\n\n## 18) I want to… tag friends but limit who sees the posts\n\nWhen you tag people in posts and photos, the audience for the post can be much\ngreater. The friend must approve the post to their timeline, but if they do,\nall of their friends will be able to see it too. For example, if you’re\ntagging a friend in a photo featuring your child, you’re expressing consent\nthat people outside of your friendship circle can view it, react to it, share\nit and even comment on it.\n\nSo, in other words, if you’re concerned about who might view the photo,\ntagging friends is best avoided.\n\n**Share your thoughts on the Facebook and Cambridge Analytica scandal with us\n@TrustedReviews.**\n\n"}
