You could\nhave it in black, or you could have nothing at all. Times have changed though,\nand now the pads are available in a veritable rainbow of shades – and Sony has\njust added four more to the gaudier end of the spectrum.**\n\nBefore I go any further, it’s worth highlighting that these are just different\ncolour schemes. There’s nothing new from a technological standpoint, other\nthan the [minor\nimprovements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DualShock#Version_issues_and_modifications)\nthat came with version 2: it’s purely cosmetic.\n\n**Read more:[Best PS4\ngames](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/ps4-games-3431751)**\n\nWith that out of the way, let’s get to the actual colours. Get your sunglasses\nready: they’re certainly bright.\n\nFirst up is Sunset Orange, which combines a kind of tangerine colouring with a\ndark blue for the undersides and buttons.\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nNext up is Berry Blue, which makes me wonder if Sony only ever read about\nberries in books. In any case, its light blue and dark mauve mix make it ideal\nfor the Aston Villa/West Ham United/Burnley fan in your life. In fact, it\nwouldn’t be surprising if said teams started selling them in their club shops.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nPerhaps you like to play your PlayStation 4 while also blending perfectly into\nyour surroundings on a covert military operation? Well, you’ll be wanting the\nblue camouflage model.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nFinally, for fans of the single-colour design, you can get a DualShock 4 pad\nin copper, which looks quite nice if you’re into that kind of\nthing.![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nWeirdly, the [European PlayStation\nblog](https://blog.eu.playstation.com/2018/08/20/three-new-special-edition-\ndualshock-4-wireless-controllers-revealed/) only mentions the latter three of\nthese in its announcement, but the official British Twitter account says all\nfour will be available for pre-order soon.\n\n> 🔵 Berry Blue  \n> 🎖️ Blue Camouflage  \n> 👮 Copper  \n> and…  \n> 🌇 Sunset Orange\n\n>\n\n> 4 new DUALSHOCK 4.

No pricing has been given, so imagine the usual £49.99 RRP, with\nrapid discounts appearing if the bright shades fail to capture the\nimagination.\n\n**Which pad looks the nicest to you?
