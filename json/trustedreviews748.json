However, they can be overwhelming, and this is especially\ntrue with Zombies.\n\nWith three vastly different stages each with their own locales, mechanics and\nquirks to consider, we wouldn’t blame players for having a guide by their side\nwhen hacking away at how everything works. Luckily, we’re here to help!\n\nLevels come in the form of Blood of the Dead, IX and Voyage of Despair, all\nthree of which we’ll be diving into throughout our guide coverage. _Trusted\nReviews_ has compiled a handy guide of tips and tricks for Call of Duty: Black\nOps 4 Zombies, with this particular article focusing on Blood of the Dead.\n\n## Black Ops 4: Blood of the Dead Guide – Turning on the power\n\nYou can find two different power switches across the spooky metal confines in\nBlood of the Dead. Newcomers might have a bit of trouble finding these\nprevious outlets without assistance, so we’ve listed where both of them can be\nfound below. Activating the power allows you to open additional doors, use\nteleporters and purchase buffs from machines.\n\n**Power Switch 1 –** To nobody’s surprise, this can be found in the Power\nHouse building. More specifically, it awaits you in the back left corner of\nthe building near a doorway.\n\n**Power Switch 2 –** This one is a bit more complicated, as you’ll need to\nventure to Building 64. Enter this spooky abode and you’ll soon stumble upon\nthe necessary switch.\n\n**Related:**[ **Best PS4 Games**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nps4-games-3431751)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n![Blood of the\nDead](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Black Ops 4: Blood of the Dead Guide – How to build the Spectral Shield\n\nThe Spectral Shield is required to unlock the Pack a Punch machine, so it’s a\nfairly vital bit of kit for players hoping to last more than 15 or so rounds\nin Blood of the Dead. We’ve put together a step-by-step guide for all of the\ncomponent locations below and the right order in which to collect them.\n\nThere are a few things to gather across Blood of the Dead to make this happen,\nso let’s get started with the **Shield** itself.\n\n**Shield – Step 1:** The first part of the shield can be found in the Citadel\nTunnels as you ascend the stairs leading to China Alley.\n\n**Shield – Step 2:** You’ll find the shield’s second part in China Alley near\na window zombies will be busting their way into during rounds.\n\n**Shield – Step 3:** Finally, the third piece is located right ahead of the\nelevator cage in Citadel Tunnels, which will be locked if the power isn’t on\nyet.\n\n**Related:**[ **Best Xbox One\nGames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/xbox-one-games-3435271)\n\n![Blood of the\nDead](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nNext up in our quest to build the Spectral Shield is the Afterlife Essence,\nthe locations of which we’ve listed below.\n\n**Afterlife Essence – Step 1:** Head to the library and look for a container\nemitting a strange, supernatural glow. Interact with it and you’ll have the\nfirst piece of the essence.\n\n**Afterlife Essence – Step 2:** It’s time to hit up Time Square, and this one\nis easy to spot. Look for a wall on the first floor to pick up the second\npart.\n\n**Afterlife Essence – Step 3:** Also an easy one to spot, head to Michigan\nAvenue and look directly underneath the ‘Michigan’ sign.\n\nThe final part requires you to find and defeat the Brutus mini-boss, who will\nonly make an appearance once both power switches have been activated. Defeat\nhim and pick up the object he drops. After this, head to a workbench and get\ncrafting to unlock the Spectral Shield.\n\n**Related:**[ **Best Nintendo Switch\nGames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-nintendo-switch-\ngames-3435122)\n\n![Blood of the\nDead](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Black Ops 4: Blood of the Dead Guide – How to unlock the Pack a Punch\nMachine\n\nIn later rounds, unlocking the Pack a Punch machine becomes a crucial part of\nsurvival in Zombies, something which is especially prevalent across Blood of\nthe Dead. Unearthing the machine is sadly quite a complicated process,\nrequiring the construction of equipment and keys obtained from difficult\nenemies.\n\nWe’ve compiled a step-by-step guide to make things easier for you below:\n\n**Step 1:** You’ll need to have constructed the Spectral Shield, a piece of\nequipment that is made from a variety of components found across the map. Once\nall the components are obtained you can fix it up a one of several workbenches\nlocated throughout the map.\n\n**Step 2:** Turn on the power! We’ve included a locations guide for this very\nstep above, and you’ll need to activate both switches before awakening the\nPack-a-Punch.\n\n**Step 3:** Defeat the Prison Warden. This undead menace is in possession of a\nkey you’ll require for the Pack a Punch Machine. He can be found in Building\n64 after switching on the power.\n\n**Step 4:** Now you’ve got the Warden Key and Spectral Shield equipped, it’s\ntime to head up to the rooftop, keep an eye on the location name in the top\nleft corner of the screen to know your bearings. It can be reached by rushing\nthrough the infirmary.\n\n**Step 5:** Once on the rooftop, it’s time to bust out your recently assembled\nSpectral Shield and start sucking up some zombie souls. Once done, kill\nroughly three zombies or so to power up the shield.\n\n**Step 6:** Finally, now the Spectral Shield is ready, melee attack the\nVoltmeter on the roof to unlock the Pack-a-Punch machine. Packing a weapon\nwill cost you 5000 points, so make sure you’re prepared before making the\ninvestment.\n\n**Related:[Best Gaming Headset](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\ngaming-headsets-3431813)**\n\n![Blood of the\nDead](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Black Ops 4: Blood of the Dead Guide – Pack a Punch Machine Locations\n\nFollowing the initial unlock process, the Pack a Punch machine can teleport to\na total of three different locations, these being: Rooftop, Dock, Spawn.\n\n## Black Ops 4: Blood of the Dead Guide – General Tips and Tricks\n\n**Keep on moving!**\n\nStaying in the same place or allowing yourself to be caught in a corner can\nspell immediate doom for you in Blood of the Dead. Aside from a handful of\nopen spaces, the map is relatively confined with dark corridors and large\nbuildings with multiple floors. This means that enemies are often crawling out\nof walls and from behind corners that can be very difficult to predict. If you\ncan, in later rounds, lure zombies after you before firing at dozens of undead\nat once. Not only does this prevent you from taking damage, but does ten-fold\nto anything in your way.\n\n**Remember potions and abilities**\n\nIt’s hard to blame newcomers for forgetting about the repertoire of abilities\nand equipment each character has access to in Blood of the Dead. You’ve got\nmultiple potions which can be customised in the lobby, each of which provides\nworthwhile buffs you’ll benefit from in battle. The same can be said for\nUltimate Weapons, which can range from katanas to flamethrowers. Using them\nresults in upgrades, and building up their activation metre is surprisingly\neasy.\n\n**Related:[Best Gaming Mouse](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-gaming-\nmouse-3515423)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Open all the doors!**\n\nExpanding the play area can be a double-edged sword. While it provides you\nwith additional places to explore and secrets to uncover, it also means the\nundead will come from a range of new directions. Blood of the Dead has them\ncrawling from the ground, through windows and even pushing out of the walls.\nThey feel unstoppable, but you and a determined group of friends can easily\ndominate them.\n\n**Teleport in later rounds**\n\nOnce the power is switched and your weapons are upgraded, quick traversal of\nthe map becomes essential. Luckily, there’s multiple points across the map\nthat you can use to teleport. This is perfect for when surrounding and need to\nescape, or hope to flank a horde of confused undead. The animation that plays\nout once you teleport also looks incredibly cool.\n\n**Upgrade weapons by using them**\n\nWhile limited to certain firearms, using some allows you to level them up,\nunlocking new attachments and bonuses to be equipped after each match. Not\nonly does this provide a meaningful sense of progression to Zombies in and out\nof matches, it also lends an extra layer of accurate firepower against the\nshambling swarms.\n\n**Have you been playing Blood of the Dead in Call of Duty: Black Ops 4?
