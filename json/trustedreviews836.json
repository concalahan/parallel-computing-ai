We welcome the activity that’s in the space. We\nthink it’s exciting. It’s actually changed that we are embracing,” said\nButler, speaking to _TrustedReviews_ at the [ CES\n2016](https://www.trustedreviews.com/hubs/ces-2016) tradeshow in Las Vegas.\n“So I think Apple can do it. I think Google can do it.”\n\nFord’s connected vehicles lead continued: “I think that what you will most\nlikely see is a number of partnerships with companies that bring different\nskill-sets to the table working together to deliver solutions that neither of\nthem could have done possibly on their own.”\n\nDespite not being formally announced, the Apple Car – an electric, autonomous\nvehicle rumoured since early 2015 – has already drawn its fair share of\nskepticism from industry veterans.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nSpeaking to CNBC last year, former General Motors Vice Chairman Bob Lutz cast\ndoubt on the [iPhone](https://www.trustedreviews.com/iphone-6s-review) maker’s\nprospects in the car industry:\n\n“You can’t show me one company in the world that, to date, has made a nickel\non electric cars. They are generally money losers and the only reason that\neveryone in producing them is because they are necessary to meet European fuel\neconomy regulations and US fuel economy regulations. There is absolutely no\nreason to assume that Apple is going to be financially successful in the\nelectric car business.”\n\nLutz went on to nail down exactly why he doesn’t believe Apple can build a\nsuccessful car empire:\n\n“First of all, Apple has no expertise in batteries. They don’t make batteries.\nThe specialized electrochemical companies make batteries and Apple is going to\nbuy batteries like everyone else. And when it comes to actually making cars,\nthere is no reason to assume that Apple, with no experience, will suddenly do\na better job than General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen, Toyota, or Hyundai.”\n\n“If I were a board member of Apple, I’d ask some serious questions about this\nthing,” he added.\n\nBut Lutz isn’t the only member of the car industry’s top brass to disparage\nApple’s yet unconfirmed car plans.\n\nDan Akerson, retired CEO of GM, told Bloomberg that he “wouldn’t be very\nhappy” if he were an Apple shareholder.\n\n“I would be highly suspect of the long-term prospect of getting into a low-\nmargin, heavy-manufacturing business,” Akerson explained. “A lot of people who\ndon’t ever operate in it don’t understand and have a tendency to\nunderestimate.”\n\n![Pioneer\nCarPlay](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)Apple’s CarPlay technology\n\n**Related:[iPhone 7 release\ndate](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/iphone-7-release-date-rumours-\nprice-specs-news-concept-pictures)**\n\nThe former car boss added: “They’d better think carefully if they want to get\ninto the hardcore manufacturing. We take steel, raw steel, and turn it into\ncar. They have no idea what they’re getting into if they get into that.”\n\nApple has already shown interest in the automotive industry with CarPlay.\n\nThe Apple technology, which lets you control an iPhone using your in-car\ndisplay, launched in 2014. The company says all major vehicle manufacturers\nare now on board with the platform.\n\nAnd financing isn’t an issue either. Apple is currently the most valuable\npublicly traded company in the world, with a record market capitalization of\n$723 billion.\n\nThat’s more than double the second and third place firms, which are Microsoft\n($357bn) and Exxon Mobil ($347bn). What’s more, last October it was revealed\nthat Apple has a staggering $206 billion in raw cash reserves.\n\n**Check out our full Ford interview below:**\n\nBut most of the doubts about Apple’s automotive credentials relate to the\nactual manufacturing of a vehicle.\n\nSpeaking to _TrustedReviews_ at CES 2016, Dave Anderson, Senior Manager of\nAutomotive Integration at Nvidia,\n[said](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/nvidia-apple-car-learning-curve):\n\n“The long-standing tradition of making cars is something that is a significant\nlearning curve, and even with a company that’s as sophisticated as Apple – and\nGoogle – that process still takes time.”\n\nIt’s not all doom and gloom, however. In 2015, prominent economics journalist\nMatthew Yglesias, of Vox, defended Apple, writing:\n\n“The logic that says Apple can’t have a high-margin car business would also\nsay Apple can’t have a high-margin smartphone business. Making an Apple-\nbranded car is a big risk with a high chance of failure, but it’s not\nqualitatively different in that regard from making an MP3 player or a\nsmartphone.”\n\nOf course, Apple has yet to confirm any such plans in the automotive sector,\nso all anyone can do is speculate for now.\n\n(apester:569795558089e8dd05d295f8)\n\nLet us know what you think of Apple’s car prospects in the comments below.\n\n"}
