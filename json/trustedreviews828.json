Google weighs in with the latest | Trusted Reviews", "description": "![Google Home Hub\nYouTube](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**When Google announced its[Home\nHub](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-home-hub) smart display at\nthe Made by Google event earlier this month, one major app was conspicuous by\nits absence.**\n\nThe video streaming service Netflix isn’t available for the Home Hub, nor any\nof the third-party smart displays outed by the likes of Lenovo thus far.\nThat’s despite a full version of Google’s own YouTube app making its presence\nfelt, with six months of fee access to YouTube Premium and access to YouTube\nTV.\n\nSo, was this a deliberate decision on Google’s part? Or was Netflix holding\nback on releasing a version of its app for the new display-enabled smart home\ndevices? Turns out its the latter.\n\nGoogle remains in talks with Netflix over bringing a version of the app –\npresumably with Google Assistant voice controls – to the Home Hub and other\nspeakers in the range.\n\nIn an interview with [The Verge\npodcast](https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/30/18042530/vergecast-podcast-\ngoogle-interview-ivy-ross-rishi-chandra-hardware) (via\n[9to5Google](https://9to5google.com/2018/10/30/made-by-google-design-home-\nhub/)), Google’s Head of Home and Nest Rishi Chandra said Netflix is adopting\na wait-and-see approach before committing to the new platform.\n\n**Related:[Google Home Hub vs Amazon Echo\nShow](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-home-hub-vs-amazon-echo-\nshow-3602099)**\n\nHe said: “Netflix is taking a reasonable approach in this sense. They want to\nunderstand how these devices are going to be used, where they’re going to be\nused before they’re going to commit themselves to a new type of device type.\nThey are being conservative on this.”\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Fallout 76 beta](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Fallout 76 beta extended after reports of a bug that deletes the entire\nthing\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/fallout-76-beta-extended-reports-bug-\ndeletes-entire-thing-3613497 \"Fallout 76 beta extended after reports of a bug\nthat deletes the entire thing\")\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Marshall Acton II\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/marshall-acton-ii \"Marshall Acton\nII\")\n\n  *   * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Best Laptop 2018: 13 notebooks for every budget\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-laptops-3431966 \"Best Laptop 2018:\n13 notebooks for every budget\")\n\n  * \n\nSo, while it might be a while before Netflix arrives on Google smart displays\nwe should see it eventually.\n\nThe Home Hub is the only first-party Google smart display available thus far\nand competes directly with the Amazon Echo Show.\n\n**Related:[Google Home Black Friday\ndeals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/google-home-black-\nfriday-3333404)**\n\nIn his review, our own David Ludlow gave the device an impressive 9/10 score,\npraising the ability to easily converse with Assistant, the extra information\ndisplayed by the touchscreen, the dedicated smart home controls and integrated\nYouTube. He said the lack of Netflix was a strike against the device, but it\nnow appears this may be resolved in the long run.\n\nIn the meantime, we sure you have other displays with Netflix, right?
