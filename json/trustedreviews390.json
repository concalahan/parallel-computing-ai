Essentially, Black Friday has become the biggest\nsales period in the calendar. It’s really risen in prominence in the UK, far\nsurpassing traditional sale dates like Boxing Day or the famous January sales.\nIt’s an opportune time to stock up on gifts before Christmas.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![iPhone XR](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### iPhone XR teardown suggests it’s the best new iPhone for battery life\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-teardown-battery-life-3613465\n\"iPhone XR teardown suggests it’s the best new iPhone for battery life\")\n\n  * [ ![Black Friday 2018](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Black Friday Deals 2018 – Best UK Sales Preview\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-black-friday-2018-deals-2952384\n\"Black Friday Deals 2018 – Best UK Sales Preview\")\n\n  *   * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Colourful new Sonos One speakers get a release date – and a price hike\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/sonos-one-colours-release-date-\nprice-3613447 \"Colourful new Sonos One speakers get a release date – and a\nprice hike\")\n\n  * \n\nThe event has also been known for some of its big controversies in the past.\nPicture stampedes as people rush into stores and fights over bargain TVs. The\ngood news is that you can avoid this by shopping online, but even online has\nhad its share of problems with websites crashing under the load of traffic and\nBlack Friday sales being called off completely by certain retailers.\n\n**Related:[Origin of Black Friday](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/when-\nis-black-friday-3582854)**\n\n## Black Friday 2018 UK – Black Friday in the UK\n\n![Black Friday\nUK](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nWhile Black Friday started out in the US, Black Friday in the UK has become\njust as big a sales day this side of the pond.\n\nBut you shouldn’t think of Black Friday as a one day event – the Black Friday\ndeals last much longer than that now. It’s evolved to become a sales\nextravaganza that spans the preceding week, and then beyond Black Friday\nitself into the following **[Cyber\nMonday](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/cyber-monday-2018-3342930)** (be\nsure to read that article for the information you need on that sales event,\ntoo).\n\nThis year, we’d be surprised if the Black Friday deals didn’t take up\npractically the entire month of November. Everyone wants to be first out the\nblocks with the best discounts, and the competitors then have to react.\n\nFor example, Currys PC World in the past has gone early with its discounts\nunder a ‘Black Tag’ sale moniker, and this usually happens the week before\n**[Currys Black Friday](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/currys-pc-world-\ndeals-black-friday-2940461)** week. Amazon has also typically built up\nanticipation with week-long discounts the week before its **[Amazon Black\nFriday](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/amazon-black-friday-2993188)**\nsales, too.\n\nThe best Black Friday deals will typically still fall on Black Friday Week (or\nsome call this _Cyber Week_ ), however. So be sure to keep the week commencing\nMonday 19th November clear in your diary. But really, we would block out all\nof November to be on the safe side.\n\n## Black Friday 2018: What’s on sale for Black Friday?\n\n![LG TV Black\nFriday](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIn terms of what goes on sale during Black Friday, it really is everything you\ncan imagine. We can make some informed predictions based on previous sale\nevents like Black Friday 2017 and Amazon Prime Day. Last year, some highlights\nincluded literal thousands of pounds off **LG OLED TVs** , £300 savings on\n**DJI drones** and **Dyson vacuum cleaners** for £200 off.\n\n**Related:[Black Friday Deals for\nTVs](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/black-friday-tv-\ndeals-2018-2993362)**\n\nThe **PS4 Pro** also had a sizeable £100 discount last year for Black Friday,\nand gaming typically features heavily. We fully expect to see deals on the\n**PS4, Xbox One** and **Nintendo Switch** again this year, as well as software\ndiscounts. Practically the entire _Trusted Reviews_ team picked up a cheap\ncopy of **Super Mario Odyssey** last year.\n\nBundle deals are also usually very popular. Typically, a bundle is the best\nvalue method to pick up a new console, provided you can find one with games\nand accessories you actually want. Otherwise, you can always sell some of the\ngames to recoup some of the cost.\n\n**Related:[Black Friday Nintendo\nSwitch](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/nintendo-switch-deals-black-\nfriday-2993180)**\n\nWhen it comes to Black Friday deals, you shouldn’t just think about short-term\nsavings on products, however. Often, you can find discounts on services for\nBlack Friday including TV, broadband and mobile phone contracts. If you’re out\nof contract and shopping around for a new service provider, waiting until\nBlack Friday can be an ideal time to sign up.\n\nBe sure to check out our **[Best Broadband\nDeals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/broadband-deals-uk-3344261)** ,\n**[Best SIM Only Deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-sim-only-\ndeals-uk-2943877) ** and **[Best Mobile Phone\nDeals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-mobile-phone-deals-3529473)**\npages where we’re constantly rounding up the best contracts and will be adding\nin Black Friday deals.\n\n* * *\n\n### _More Black Friday 2018_\n\n  * [Black Friday PS4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-ps4-deals-black-friday-2993085)\n  * [Black Friday Laptops](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/laptop-deals-black-friday-3238633)\n  * [Black Friday Dyson](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/dyson-black-friday-2018-deals-we-expect-and-discounts-live-now-2942479)\n  * [Black Friday Apple Watch](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-apple-watch-deals-black-friday-3238555)\n  * [Black Friday GoPro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/gopro-black-friday-3242546)\n  * [Black Friday Sonos](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/sonos-black-friday-2018-3281985)\n  * [Black Friday iPhone](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/iphone-black-friday-deals-3597079)\n\n* * *\n\n## Black Friday 2018 – Black Friday sales from UK retailers\n\n![Apple Black\nFriday](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nEvery retailer will get involved for Black Friday in the UK. But the biggest\nplayers will be [Amazon](https://amzn.to/2xjQAqu),\n[Currys](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=1599&clickref=tr-\nblackfriday&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fgbuk%2Findex.html),\n[Argos](http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8209862/type/dlg/sid/tr-\nblackfriday/https://www.argos.co.uk/events/black-friday), [John\nLewis](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=1203&clickref=tr-\nblackfriday&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnlewis.com%2F),\n[Very](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=3090&clickref=tr-\nblackfriday&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.very.co.uk%2F),\n[AO](https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101l3qRc/pubref:tr-blackfriday) and all of\nthe major supermarkets for Black Friday deals. Retailers like Argos have even\ngone so far as to prepare their Black Friday landing pages nice and early.\nYou’ll still have to wait until November to see the actual deals but you can\nsign up for notifications.\n\nWe’ll be rounding up all of the very best Black Friday deals right here, but\nwe’re also breaking them down by retailer at their respective pages. Here’s\nwhat we expect to see from Amazon, Currys, Argos and John Lewis this Black\nFriday.\n\n**[Amazon Black Friday](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/amazon-black-\nfriday-2993188): ** Amazon’s own Prime Day discount bonanza is a really good\nindicator of what we can expect when Black Friday rolls around. We were\nchecking the historical prices for everything we posted during our Prime Day\n2018 round-up recently, and noticed a lot of Prime Day 2017’s prices were the\nsame or similar to what appeared a few months later for Black Friday 2017. So,\nwith that in mind, we fully expect to see Amazon price-matching some of its\nbig discounts from Prime Day 2018. Some notable discounts this year included:\n\n  * **Kindle Paperwhite** for £75 – save £35\n  * **Amazon Fire 7 Kids Edition Tablet** for £60 – save £40\n  * **Amazon Fire HD 8 Tablet** for £60 – save £30\n  * **Amazon Echo Show** for £100 – save £100\n  * **Samsung Galaxy S8** SIM free w/ 64GB microSD for £439 – save £69\n  * **Motorola Moto G6** SIM free for £199.99 – save £40\n  * **Fitbit Charge 2** for £79.99 – save £30\n  * **Fitbit Blaze** for £99.99 – save £50\n\n**[Currys Black Friday](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/currys-pc-world-\ndeals-black-friday-2940461): ** If you’re after some of the perhaps less\nglamorous items like a new washing machine or fridge freezer, Currys might be\nyour destination of choice. Last year the **Samsung AddWash** washing machine\nhad £300 taken off its price, which is great news for anyone who forgets to\nadd their socks to their washing load. The PC World half of Currys PC World\noften also has good discounts on laptops from the likes of **HP** , **Lenovo**\nand **Asus**.\n\n**[Argos Black Friday](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/argos-deals-black-\nfriday-2993228): ** If there’s one area where Argos is particularly strong\naround Black Friday, it’s toys. The retailer is already famous for its regular\n3 for 2 discounts, but it usually ramps things up even more for its Black\nFriday deals bonanza. So if you’re shopping for Christmas gifts for the\nyounger family members, it should be your first stop. There’s every chance\nArgos will also throw in vouchers on top of your spend (often £5 for £50\nspend, or £10 for £100), which adds to the value. You can also collect Nectar\npoints.\n\n**[John Lewis Black Friday:](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/john-lewis-\ndeals-black-friday-2940065) ** John Lewis’ two major plus points is its ‘Never\nKnowingly Undersold’ price-matching and its extended warranties. If you’re\nshopping for a new TV, be sure to see what John Lewis has to offer as not only\nwill it price-match, it also includes 5 year warranties that add serious extra\nvalue. John Lewis also does well for its home and kitchen appliances like\nvacuum cleaners, coffee machines and juicers.\n\nBeyond the ‘Big Four’ retailers, even the juggernauts like **Apple** can’t\nresist. It’s a great time to pick up anything from **iPhone 8** to **iPhone\nX** Black Friday discounts, as well as **MacBooks** and other high price\nitems.\n\nOther manufacturer stores, like **Dell** and **Lenovo** , will also host Black\nFriday deals and discounts. Black Friday is a great time for computing deals.\nFamously, Marks & Spencers is one of the few retailers to bow out of Black\nFriday, having not taken part the last two years. Not officially at least.\n\nWhile that’s a lot of places to look, the good news is that we’ll take on that\nlegwork and post all of the best deals here at _Trusted Reviews._ We’ll be\ncurating the best of Black Friday in the UK to make spotting those veritable\nbargains that much easier.\n\nOur team has lived through several Black Friday events now, so we can spot a\ngood deal from a dud. We can also give you the advice you need on potential\npurchases, as we have a team knowledgable in their respective fields.\n\n## Black Friday 2018: Black Friday deals to avoid\n\n![Black Friday\n2018](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIf you’re not careful you might end up waiting for your Black Friday deals to\narrive on a shipping container like this… Photo by kinsey on Unsplash\n\nWe cover everything you need to know about snagging yourself a genuine deal in\nour **[Black](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/shopping-tips-black-\nfriday-3607034)[ Friday shopping tips and\ntricks](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/shopping-tips-black-\nfriday-3607034) ** article. This includes lots of helpful information\nincluding how to spot a genuine deal by checking the historical prices.\n\nBut what about deals you should avoid this Black Friday? There will be plenty\nof duds out there if you’re not careful. One big area of confusion can often\narise around ‘grey imports’. On the surface, these can look like fantastic\ndeals. But what you need to be aware of is that these grey imports are often\nproducts imported from outside the EU, often from Hong Kong or China.\n\nThis can be problematic for a number of reasons. First off, if actually being\nshipped to you directly from halfway across the world, delivery time can be\nvery slow. Think weeks to even months. Then you have to factor in the chance\nof having to pay customs duty when your item reaches the UK.\n\nSome grey importers will have these products located in the UK already, which\ndoes avoid the above pitfall. However, as these products originate from\noutside the UK, they can often not be covered by a local warranty. That’s a\nproblem if you encounter any issues down the line and need manufacturer\nsupport. In the long run, that saving might not look so great after all.\n\nThere are also other problems you might not expect, like manuals not being\nlocalised. You might also find yourself scrambling for a plug adaptor as it\nmight not be the three-prong plug you need for the UK, or missing out on\naccessories you would normally get from an item bought here.\n\nWe’re sure not to recommend any deals from grey importers for these reasons.\n\n* * *\n\n_We may earn a commission if you click a deal and buy an item.
