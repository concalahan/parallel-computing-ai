The [Nexus 5](https://www.trustedreviews.com/google-\nnexus-5-review) inspired. The [Nexus\n6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/nexus-6-review), however, has been something\nof a flop.**\n\nHaving shunned the Nexus brand’s recent ethos – impressive specs at an\naffordable price – the Motorola-made Nexus 6 moved to an oversized 6-inch\nform, uncompromising specs sheet and flagship level price point.\n\nNow, during the company’s quarterly earnings call, Google has spoken out on\nhow a ‘decline in Nexus’ interest has troubled the search giant’s hardware\nefforts in recent months.\n\nThis slump in Nexus sales isn’t shouldered solely by the Nexus 6, however. The\ncompany’s most recent tablet offering, the Nexus 9, has also been troubled by\nsimilar shortcomings.\n\nDespite a cooling interest in Nexus products, Google saw its overall quarterly\nrevenues grow by 23 per cent year-on-year.\n\n“Other revenues grew 23 percent year over year to $1.8 billion, but were down\n2 percent quarter over quarter, driven really by year over year growth in the\nPlay Store, offset by decline in Nexus, and the currency fluctuations,” the\ncompany announced (via 9to5Google).\n\nSpokespeople added: “Year over year it hasn’t been as strong given the\nstrength of the Nexus 7 last year.”\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nIt is currently unclear how low Nexus 6 sales have been.\n\n**Related:** [Samsung Galaxy Note 5 release\ndate](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-5-release-date-\nrumours-news-specs-and-price)\n\nThe Nexus 6 landed back in October as the launch device for Google’s latest\nAndroid 5.0 Lollipop OS.\n\nThe handset features a 6-inch, 2560 x 1440 pixel QHD display alongside a\n2.7GHz quad-core Snapdragon 805 processor, 3GB of RAM and a 13-megapixel\nprimary camera.\n\n"}
