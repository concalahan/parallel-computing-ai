It’s pretty straightforward getting a [Kodi on FireTV](https://www.trustedreviews.com/how-to/install-kodi-fire-tv-stick-2949936)devices, and the dongle and box both support most popular streaming services,including Prime Video, Netflix, iPlayer, YouTube and Spotify.Better still, Amazon is cutting the price of both these devices **from 9am GMTon Wednesday, February 7.**  * **Get Deal:[Amazon Fire TV 4K Ultra HD for just £59.99 – save £10](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B06XTWLSRF/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=sl1&tag=tr_dailydeals-21&linkId=d5a48b37f80993d5918d01f7d3d97010)**Alternatively, save some space (and even more money!) and still enjoy a greatKodi (and all round streaming experience) with the marvellous Fire TV Stick.  * **Get Deal:[Amazon Fire TV 4K Ultra HD for just £59.99 – save £10](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B06XTWLSRF/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=sl1&tag=tr_dailydeals-21&linkId=d5a48b37f80993d5918d01f7d3d97010)**These are currently the three best Kodi-friendly Android TV devices on themarket – again, we wouldn’t recommend no-name Android TV boxes, due to safetyconcerns.There are plenty of other ways you can equip yourself with Kodi, from new-genconsoles like the [Xbox One X](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/xbox-one-x) and [Xbox One S](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/xbox-one-s), toRaspberry Pi and Linux-based, but Android TV devices offer the idealcombination of usability and affordability, in our opinion.The newly announced [Asus Chromebox3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/asus-chromebox-3-looks-like-mac-mini-upgrade-apple-refuses-make-3368075) also holds some promise further down theroad, but we’ll need to wait for it be released so we can test it out forourselves before recommending it.**What’s your favourite ‘Kodi box’ or Android TV device?
