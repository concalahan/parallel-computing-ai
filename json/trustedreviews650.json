Could that mean we’re going to get a ‘one more thing’ from Sammy\nthis autumn in Berlin?\n\nIt’s possible, but doesn’t seem likely – the dual event strategy probably\nmeans Samsung will talk about other consumer goods like fridges and TVs at its\nSeptember conference, though the Gear S3 will no doubt get a second mention.\n\nSamsung also notes that it’ll be live streaming the Gear launch event, so you\ncan follow all the action from Berlin wherever you are.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThe _TrustedReviews_ team will be attending IFA 2016, so you’ll find all the\nlatest news, first impressions and analysis right here.\n\n**Related:[IFA 2016 preview – What to\nexpect](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ifa-2016-berlin-news-rumours-\nkeynote-best-highlights-dates-schedule)**\n\n**Watch: Wearables and fitness buying guide**\n\n**  \nAre you excited for the Gear S3 smartwatch?
