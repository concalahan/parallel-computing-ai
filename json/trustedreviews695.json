To turn this on,on your iPhone 8 just go to Settings > Phone > Wi-Fi Calling and toggle thissetting on. This is great if there are certain places where you never getreception, such as in basements.### Move providers but keep your phone numberIf you’re moving network providers, say from O2 to EE, you can bring your oldphone number with you. No need to message everyone in your phone book withyour new digits. To do this, simply contact your old provider either by phoneor online and ask for something called a PAC code.You then take this PAC code and give it to your new provider. This gives thempermission to port over your old phone number, which often takes about onebusiness day so be sure to keep your old SIM in the interim if you don’t wantto go off the grid. After it’s all done, you’ll have the phone number it’staken you years to memorise available to use with your shiny new phone andprovider.
