This article contains\neverything you need to know, including the specifications of every processor\nlaunched so far for laptops and desktops, plus the latest news on an impending\nspecs refresh.**\n\n**Key details  \n**\n\n  * **NEW:** New desktop and laptop chips quietly appear\n  * Originally launched at the end of 2016 and beginning of 2017\n  * Offers minor performance bump over Skylake\n\n## Latest news: Minor refresh inbound\n\nIntel has sneakily launched four new desktop processors and two new laptop\nprocessors into the market. They’re small updates, but you’ll likely see them\nin pre-built PCs and laptops near you in the coming months.\n\nBelow you can find the full list of processors that were launched over the\nweekend, and then below that you’ll find the rest of the 7th-generation Kaby\nLake processors that were already on the market.\n\nFirst up, the new desktop chips. These all take the form if fairly low-end\nCore i3 chips for cheap or compact desktops. The chips with a T at the end are\nfor small form-factor PCs and all-in-ones, while those without a letter suffix\nare regular processors you’ll be able to stick into your Kaby Lake motherboard\nif you so wish.\n\nChip | Cores/Threads | Base/maximum clock speed (GHz) | TDP | Notes  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nCore i3-7120T | 2/4 | 3.5GHz (locked) | 35W | 0.1GHz increase on 7100T  \nCore i3-7120 | 2/4 | 4GHz (locked) | 51W | 0.1GHz increase on 7100  \nCore i3-7320T | 2/4 | 3.6GHz (locked) | 35W | 0.1GHz increase on 7300T  \nCore i3-7340 | 2/4 | 4.2GHz (locked) | 51W | 02.GHz increase on 7300  \n  \n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nOn the laptop side, we have some very minor updates to the U-Suffix dual-core\nprocessors. These chips are found in both cheap and compact laptops, but can\nalso be found in the likes of the MacBook Pro and Surface Laptop, among\nothers. Both the new Core i5 and i7 chips have 0.2GHz increases in maximum\nTurbo Boost speed, while one Core i3 has been downclocked and the other gets a\n0.2GHz increase.\n\nChip | Cores/Threads | Base/maximum clock speed (GHz) | TDP | Notes  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nCore i3-7007U | 2/4 | 2.1GHz (locked) | 15W | 03.GHz decrease on 7100U  \nCore i3-7110U | 2/4 | 2.6GHz (locked) | 15W | 0.2GHz increase on 7100U  \nCore i5-7210U | 2/4 | 2.5 / 3.3GHz | 15W | 0.2GHz increase on 7200U  \nCore i7-7510U | 2/4 | 2.7 / 3.7GHz | 15W | 0.2GHz increase on 7500U  \n  \n## What is Kaby Lake?  \n\nKaby Lake is a minor upgrade because Intel has ditched its “Tick-Tock”\napproach to processor design, meaning there are no major structural changes to\nthe chip or what it’s capable of.\n\n**Video: We explain Kaby Lake as fast as possible**\n\nPreviously, each generation of Intel processors would see a reduction in\nprocess size (smaller, lower power consumption) and then an improvement in\narchitecture (more powerful). This was called Tick-Tock.\n\n**Related:[The best gaming PC you can build\nyourself](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/best-gaming-pc \"Best Gaming\nPC\")**\n\nInstead of Tick-Tock, Intel has now stretched out the lifespan of a given\nprocess size – in this case, 14nm (nanometers) – to three phases. Its new\napproach first sees a reduction in process size, then an upgrade to\narchitecture, with a final “optimisation” phase added to make the most of\nwhat’s been done so far.\n\nProcess, Architecture, Optimisation. Drum that into your head.\n\nThis is bad for fans of big-number upgrades, but obviously great for Intel,\nwhich is able to make the most of what has become an increasingly complex\nprocess of designing chips.\n\nIt also means it’s able to offer up fairly small, semi-annual upgrades with\nbrand-new model names, which laptop and desktop manufacturers can use to show\noff and shift more units.\n\nIn the case of this generation of 14nm hardware, 5th-gen “Broadwell” was the\nprocess redesign; Skylake was the architecture redesign (meaning an entirely\nnew socket); with Kaby Lake the last hurrah for 14nm before Intel moves onto\n“Cannonlake”, which will be a 10nm design.\n\n**For more information on some of the more technical aspects of Kaby Lake, see\nour other articles:**\n\n  * [Intel Kaby Lake review: In-depth testing of the i7-7700K](https://www.trustedreviews.com/intel-core-i7-7700k-review \"Core i7-7700K review\")\n  * [Intel Core i3, i5 and i7 Explained](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/best-intel-processor-core-i3-i5-i7 \"Intel Core i3 i5 i7 explained\")\n\nFor its 7th-generation Core, Intel is describing its 14nm process as 14nm+.\nWith the move to Broadwell, Intel started to manufacture taller and thinner\ntransistor fins. This essentially allows for increased drive current and\nperformance.\n\nA continuation of this technology is enabling Intel to drive greater\nperformance for Kaby Lake with the same power consumption as 6th-generation\nCore. Better efficiency in the chip also means that the processors can Turbo\nBoost to higher speeds for longer.\n\nPerhaps the biggest change to the processor is the addition of a new media\nengine, which can decode Ultra HD video on-chip. While previous Core chips may\nhave been powerful enough to do so in software, the effect on battery life was\nnoticeable.\n\nBy shifting decoding into hardware, Intel can improve battery life and reduce\nheat, and is quoting three times the battery life when decoding 4K video. That\nfigure will depend on the particular laptop, but it’s certainly an impressive\nfeature. Intel’s media engine will decode VP9 and HEVC 10-bit codecs, which\ncovers the most popular Ultra HD formats – especially for streaming.\n\nAside from increased efficiency and higher clock speeds, Intel’s so-called\nSpeed Shift technology will see processors able to change clock speed faster\nthan previous generations. This means in short-burst tasks such as opening\napps, Kaby Lake chips will be snappier.\n\nThere’s also an updated set of chipsets, with desktop motherboards receiving a\nminor specs bump in line with Kaby Lake chips’ new capabilities.\n\nIn short, there will be more PCI-E lanes than before, which means you’ll be\nable to connect more high-end peripherals without running into speed\nbottlenecks. There are 24 in the new Z270 chipset versus the old Z170 chipset.\n\n![Kaby Lake\n5](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nYou also now get support for Intel Optane, a new technology Intel previously\ntalked about in relation to ultra-high-performance storage for servers.\n\nHere, Intel has incorporated Optane support into motherboards, which will\nallow users to install a low-cost, low-capacity Optane module onto their\nsystem. These modules will likely be low-capacity storage devices that are\nfaster than an SSD but slower than system memory (RAM), providing a\nperformance boost in a similar way to how hybrid hard disks work today.\n\nThere’s also been a big improvement in terms of graphics, which could prove to\nbe a big deal for gamers on a tight budget. While Intel HD graphics doesn’t\nappear to have been hugely improved, new Intel Iris Plus 640 and 650 graphics\nshould see gaming performance improve significantly.\n\nSpecifically, Intel claims that processors equipped with Intel Iris Plus 650\nwill show 65% better graphics performance than regular HD Graphics 630. That’s\na big deal – and actually makes some lighter 3D games, such as Overwatch,\nplayable in Full HD. We’ll have to test this ourselves to see if there are any\ncaveats.\n\n![Kaby Lake\n1](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nThe first set of Kaby Lake laptop chips actually launched in late 2016, with\nvarious low-power chips making their debuts on laptops such as the Dell XPS\n13, Razer Blade Stealth and Acer Spin 7.\n\n![Kaby Lake\n4](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nIntel also snuck out an interesting new desktop processor in the form of the\nIntel Core i3-7350K. This is a follow-up to the firm’s Pentium Anniversary\nEdition G3258, and brings overclocking to a Core i3 chip for the first time.\nIt gets a clock speed of 4.2GHz and has a dual-core architecture with Hyper-\nThreading, meaning a lack of cores shouldn’t prove a huge bottleneck in most\ngames.\n\nThis chip should be much more competitive than the Pentium when it launched,\nalthough the price will be higher as well.\n\nAs of today, this is the full range of Intel Kaby Lake chips for consumers.\nWe’ve not included Intel Xeon chips for servers.\n\n## Complete list of every 7th-gen Intel Core i “Kaby Lake” processor\n\n## Laptops\n\n**  \nExtreme low-power chips, “Y-Series”, formerly Core M**\n\nYou’ll find these in high-end, ultra-thin laptops.
