All\nsigns are pointing to a dual release incorporating a [new Nexus 5 and a new\nNexus 6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-nexus-5-and-huawei-\nnexus-6-specs-tipped-in-new-leak), with LG and Huawei taking on the respective\nmanufacturing duties.\n\nOne recent report claims that these devices will be called the [Nexus 5X and\nNexus 6P](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/report-google-s-new-smartphones-\ncalled-nexus-5x-and-nexus-6p), which would at least provide some\ndifferentiation from the previous devices.\n\nWe’ve heard more about the new Nexus 5 in recent months, but [Android\nPolice](http://www.androidpolice.com/2015/09/19/huaweis-nexus-phone-will-be-\nthe-first-nexus-device-to-offer-up-to-128gb-of-storage/) has provided some\nfresh snippets on Huawei’s super-sized Nexus debut.\n\nApparently, the new Nexus 6 will come with three storage options: 32GB, 64GB,\nand 128GB.\n\nGiven that recent Android flagships such as the [Samsung Galaxy\nS6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-s6-review), the [HTC One\nM9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/htc-one-m9-review), and the [LG\nG4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/lg-g4-review) have cut back on such high-\nend storage options, the presence of a 128GB option will make the new Nexus 6\ninstantly appealing to some.\n\nIt would also mark the first Nexus device to offer such a sizeable amount of\ninternal storage.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n**Related:[Best Android Smartphones 2015](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-\nandroid-phones-1_round-up)**\n\nOf course, as the report points out, it’s also unlikely that the Huawei Nexus\n6 will support microSD expansion, so those seeking a device that offers the\nendless smartphone capacity of old might need to curtail their expectations.\n\nIn addition to these two new Nexus phones, expect Google to talk more about\nthe Android 6.0 Marshmallow OS that will run on them at its September 29\nevent. It could also launch a new Chromecast and possibly even a new Nexus\ntablet, too.  \n **  \nCheck out our smartphone buyer’s video guide below:**\n\n"}
