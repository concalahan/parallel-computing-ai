Here’s everything you need toknow about the Snapdragon 835, including benchmark results, new features andwhere you’ll find it this year.**## What is the Snapdragon 835?The 835 is Qualcomm’s mobile system on a chip (SoC), which contains all thekey ingredients that sit at the heart of a smartphone. This includes the CPU,graphics processor, Wi-Fi and 4G modems, sound hardware and sensor hubs, amongothers.It’s the successor to the Snapdragon 821, which launched last year as a minorimprovement to the 820. Found in many of last year’s top-end phones, includingthe [Samsung Galaxy S7]()Single-core is much more important for most tasks, and the 835 does a decentjob here, just eeking out the Kirin 960. However, it’s still well behind theking of single-core computing, the Apple A10 Fusion. There are lots of reasonsfor this beyond the capabilities of the CPU. Apple uses high-end componentsthat most other Android phones don’t, including incredibly fast memory thatdirectly helps single-core performance. Plus, iOS is more tightly integratedwith the iPhone’s hardware. That’s why iPhones always feel so snappy.The 835 did well in the multi-core tests, a little ahead of the Kirin 960 anda decent chunk ahead of the A10 Fusion.## Performance conclusionsThe 835 is clearly a handy performer, but it faces stiff competition fromHiSilicon’s Kirin 960 and, as ever, Apple’s A10 Fusion. Not surprisingly, itobliterates previous-gen kit from Samsung, but we’ve yet to see what sort ofperformance the new Samsung Exynos 8895 will be capable of.Given the Exynos is built on the same 10nm process and is based on ARMdesigns, we’d expect the two processors to perform similarly.There are plenty of unknowns right now. The lower power consumption figuresand faster charging are as-yet untested by us, and beyond raw performance,will be key when it comes to making a buying decision.**Related:[Samsung Galaxy S8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s8-release-date-specs-rumours-price-uk)****What do you think of our benchmarks?
