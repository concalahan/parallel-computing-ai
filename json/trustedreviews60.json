Google Play Music is also greatif you’re happy streaming music you already own, while the other two are spoton for casual music listening when you just need to fill some time, say, atthe gym or on the way to work.Amazon’s Prime Music option is also good for this, though as it’s bundled inwith Amazon’s £79/year Prime membership, it isn’t technically ‘free’.For all-round music discovery, interface richness and effort-free playlistcuration, we’re inclined to stick with Spotify for the time being. However, wealso know plenty of people who have moved to Apple Music and don’t regret it,and Deezer is catch up fast, matching Spotify in features and pricing.If you’re not convinced by any of these service’s stand-out features, the bestbet is to give a few a go. While Apple Music doesn’t have a free service,there is a generous 3-month trial that is free in the US and UK, and mostothers will offer you a 30-day taster.
