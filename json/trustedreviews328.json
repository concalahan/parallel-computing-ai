So not radically different to existing HDR modes likethe one on the Pixel 2, but useful all the same.The A12 Bionic’s machine learning prowess will also add rocket fuel to morecommon camera modes like portrait mode and portrait lighting, allowing forclearer live FaceTime calls, apparently thanks to the Neural Engine allowingfor better detection of faces and bodies when taking pictures and video. Thiswill also see fun things like Animoji look more cartoonish.Apple’s A12 Bionic chip follows the 7nm fabrication process. The previous [A11Bionic](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-a11-processor-specs-performance-benchmarks-3286346) and Qualcomm’s current Snapdragon 845 CPUsboth use 10nm processes. Generally speaking, smaller nodes means you can fitmore components onto the same physical space, allowing for faster, morepowerful processors.Recently, Huawei unveiled its first 7nm mobile CPU, the [Huawei Kirin980](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/kirin-980-features-release-date-3548238), at IFA in Berlin earlier in September. Huawei quoted anequivalent 20% speed and 40% efficiency boost on its previous generation 970.Qualcomm’s rumoured [Snapdragon855](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/qualcomm-snapdragon-855-3537526) CPUis also expected to be 7nm.**Related:[iPhone XS vs Galaxy S9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-xs-vs-galaxy-s9-3564946)**## Apple A12 benchmarksApple has yet to reveal any benchmarking scores for the A12 Bionic – and itmay never.That said, a number of ‘leaked’ A12 benchmarks have been doing the rounds onthe internet.The latest came from French site[iGeneration](https://www.igen.fr/iphone/2018/07/premier-benchmark-dun-mysterieux-iphone-2018-dote-de-4-go-de-ram-104545).
