Here’s everything you need to know, including the\nlatest Google I/O 2017 news and all the announcements that actually matter.\n\nThe Google I/O developer conference is running from May 17 to May 19, and\ntakes place at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in sunny Mountain View, California,\nwith the main keynote kicking off things on Wednesday May 17.\n\nHere are the eight Google I/O keynote announcements you need to know about.\n\n## 1) Android O boosts your phone’s intelligence\n\nWe also received an update on Android from Dave Burke, VP of Engineering at\nAndroid, who revealed that 82 billion apps and games had been installed by\nAndroid users in the last year – that’s 11 apps for every person on the\nplanet.\n\n![dave\nburke](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)_Dave Burke, Vice President of Engineering at\nAndroid_\n\nBurke talked up picture-in-picture integration, which is being added in the\nupcoming Android O update this summer. That’s coming alongside ‘autofill’,\nwhich will be familiar to Chrome users who regularly fill out forms that\nrequire personal information to be entered. Well in Android O, autofill is\nbeing extended to apps, which “takes the pain out of setting up a new Android\nphone or tablet”, according to Burke.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThere’s also a new feature called ‘Smart Text Selection’. In Android, you\ntypically double-tap or hold to select words for copying and pasting – but\nGoogle wants to improve that. By using machine learning, Google will\nunderstand what you want to select, so you spend less time fiddling around\nwith selection handles. So if you double-tap on part of an address, it will\nselect the whole address, because it understands what an address is. It’s the\nsame story with phone numbers or e-mail addresses or the name of a restaurant,\ntoo.\n\n**Related:[How to download the Android O\nbeta](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/android-o-8-features-preview-name-\nrumours-release-date-news-download-beta)**\n\n## 2) Standalone Daydream VR headsets\n\nOne of the biggest announcements was that Google had teamed up with Qualcomm\nto build a standalone Daydream virtual reality headset.\n\nThis builds on last year’s Daydream platform, but removes the need for you to\ndock a smartphone into a headset. Instead, the head-mounted display will\ncontain all of the necessary features, including a display and processor – and\neven offer positional tracking. It’s been designed using Qualcomm’s Snapdragon\n835 VR reference platform, and (unsurprisingly) features the [Snapdragon\n835](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/snapdragon-835-phones-processor-\nspecs-speed-benchmark-chipset-cores) chip we’ve seen used in flagship phones\nlike the new [Samsung Galaxy S8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-\ngalaxy-s8-review).\n\n![clay\nbavor](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nImportantly, neither Google nor Qualcomm will be actually selling these\nheadsets to people. What the two companies have created is actually a\nreference design that will be used by third-party device makers to create\ntheir own VR headsets. We’re expecting these headsets to launch later this\nyear. HTC and Lenovo have both been confirmed to be building devices.\n\nWe also learned that the Samsung Galaxy S8 would be adding\n[Daydream](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/what-is-daydream-vr-google-\ns-virtual-reality-platform-explained) support later this year, and that LG’s\nnext flagship phone – likely the LG V30 – would also support the technology.\n\n**Related:[Google VR standalone\nheadsets](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-vr-wireless-daydream-\nheadset-release-date-uk-features-price)**\n\n## 3) Google Assistant updated\n\nGoogle confirmed that the Google Assistant virtual helper would soon support\ntyping requests, for when you’re not feeling comfortable with talking aloud.\nGoogle also said that it’d made significant strides in how well Google\nAssistant understands your commands.\n\n“Almost 70% of requests to the Google Assistant are expressed in natural\nlanguage, not the usual keywords,” explained Scott Huffman, VP of Engineering\nfor Google Assistant. “We’re really starting to crack the hard computer\nscience of conversationality.”\n\nThere’s also a new Google Assistant SDK that will enable third-party companies\nto build Google Assistant into their devices, including smart speakers. There\nare plenty of companies working on this integration, including Sony,\nPanasonic, and LG.\n\n**Related:[Google Pixel 2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-\npixel-2-release-date-specs-rumours-price-uk-xl)**\n\n## 4) Google Assistant lands on iPhone\n\nAs expected, Google announced that the Google Assistant virtual helper would\nbecome available on iOS devices.\n\nThe software launched back in 2016, but has only been available on Google\ndevices so far – Google Home or Android Nougat devices, for instance.\n\nBut soon, iPhone users will be able to download the Google Assistant app from\nApple’s own App Store, giving Siri a direct rival on iOS. However, it’s\nunlikely that Google Assistant will be as deeply integrated into the iPhone as\nSiri, so we’d guess that functionality may be slightly more limited.\n\n**Related:[WWDC 2017](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-\nwwdc-2017-date-latest-news-rumours-live-keynote-highlights-tickets-video)**\n\n## 5) Google Lens Revealed  \n\nGoogle also announced a new smart context technology using your phone’s camera\ncalled Google Lens. “Google Lens is a set of vision based computing\ncapabilities, that can understand what you’re looking at,” explained CEO\nSundar Pichai.\n\nFor example, you can point your phone at restaurants, and using location data,\nthe Google Lens will provide information like reviews, based on what your\nphone is looking at. It will be shipping first in Google Assistant later this\nyear.\n\n“If you run into something and you want to know what it is, say a flower,” he\ntold developers, “we can tell you what flower it is.”\n\n**Related:[What is Google Lens?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/what-is-\ngoogle-lens)**\n\n## 6) Google Home News and Updates\n\nFollowing this year’s UK launch, Google confirmed that the Google Home smart\nspeaker would be launching in Canada, Australia, France, Germany, and Japan\nthis summer.\n\nGoogle also announced that there would be a bunch of new features incoming.\n“We’ve been really busy,” said Rishi Chandra, VP of Home Products. “Since\nlaunch, we’ve added over 50 new features.”\n\nFor instance, there will now be proactive assistance. You’ll be notified of\nupcoming events, as well as flight status changes and traffic delays.\n\nYou’ll also get hands-free calling on Google Home, which is a service that’s\nalready offered by rival device [Amazon\nEcho](https://www.trustedreviews.com/amazon-echo-review). You’ll be able to\ncall any landline or mobile number in the USA completely free of charge –\nassuming you’re already in the USA, of course. Also, calling is personalised,\nso saying “call my mum” will ring different numbers depending on whose voice\nhas been recognised.\n\n**Related:[Google Home review](https://www.trustedreviews.com/google-home-\nreview)**\n\n![Google\nHome](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThis hands-free calling will roll out to all US-based Google Home devices over\nthe next few months.\n\nWhat’s more, Spotify, in addition to their subscription service, will be\nadding their free music service to Google Home. There’ll also be support for\nSoundCloud and Deezer soon, joining existing supported services like YouTube\nMusic.\n\nThere’s also Bluetooth support coming, so you can play your own tunes from an\nAndroid or iOS device. Finally, TV control support is also being added for new\nservices like HBO Now, alongside Netflix and YouTube, which were already\nsupported.\n\n**Related:[What is Bluetooth 5?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/what-\nis-bluetooth-5)**\n\n## 7) Google Photos is getting smarter\n\nYou know when you take a great photo with friends, but you forget to send it\nto your mates? That perfect wedding shot your new wife keeps bugging you for?\nWell Google is rolling out suggested sharing for Google Photos, which will\nprompt you to share images with people who it knows are in the photo. Your\nfriends will never have to miss out on an epic group selfie again. Poor them.\nOf course, you could still deny them just like before…\n\n![share](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nGoogle also launched shared libraries, which lets you share an entire\nselection of photos with a person. For instance, you can select to show photos\nthat include images of your children (tagged via machine learning, of course)\nwith your mum. Or all photos after a certain date, like sharing every photo\nwith your partner that you’ve taken since you first met them. It’s all\nautomatic, so you don’t even need to do anything once you’ve set up those\ninitial sharing parameters.\n\nBoth those features will be rolling out on iOS and Android in the coming\nweeks.\n\nBut wait, there’s more! Google is also making it easier to print your photos\nusing Google Photos. There’s now a new feature called Photo Books that lets\nyou compile a scrapbook of great snaps from your phone, and then get it\nprinted out into a physical product. The books cost $9.99 for a 7-inch\nsoftcover book or $19.99 for a 9-inch hardcover book. Both books are 20 pages\nlong, but you can pay more for additional pages. Magical.\n\n![photo\nbooks](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe Photo Books service is available in the USA starting today, with plans to\nroll out the service to more countries soon – UK users, get those fingers\ncrossed.\n\n## 8) Android Go will improve budget phones\n\nAndroid Go is a new project that intends to optimise user experiences for\npeople with affordable, entry-level devices. All devices with 1GB of RAM or\nless will get the Go configuration starting with Android O.\n\nFor example, memory is expensive, so Google is making a number of\noptimisations so that Android O devices built with Go configuration to run\nsmoothly for devices with less than 1GB of memory.\n\nOn these devices, you’ll also have the Chrome Data Saver feature turned on by\ndefault, to simplify web-pages when you’re using a slow connection. This saves\nusers over 750TB every day, according to Sameer Samat, VP of Android and Play.\n\n![sameer](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)_Sameer Samat, VP of Android and Play at Google_\n\nThere’s also a new preview mode for YouTube videos on ‘YouTube Go’, which will\nlet you see a low-res montage from a video so you can decide whether to watch\nit. You’ll also get to see how much data it will use, before actually watching\nit.\n\nThere will also be ‘lite’ versions of apps – some of which already exist –\nthat will be useful in offline states, take up limited storage and memory, and\noffer good battery performance. These will be highlighted specifically in the\nGoogle Play Store.\n\nAndroid Go is a clear bid to get more people in developing markets using\nAndroid phones, by making cheap phones better in areas where you might have\npoor data coverage.\n\n**Related:[What is Android Go?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/what-is-\nandroid-go-phones-devices-apps-system-requirements-youtube-go)**\n\n## Google I/O 2017 Keynote: Re-watch all the action here  \n\nMissed the I/O 2017 keynote? Fear not, you can still watch the event in its\nentirety below – the action begins at around the 30 minute mark.\n\n## Google’s Progress by the numbers\n\nSundar Pichai, Chief Executive Officer at Google revealed a bunch of\ninteresting stats about how Google services are doing.
