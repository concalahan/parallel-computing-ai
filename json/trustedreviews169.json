Anker confirmed the bad news to Alex,\nsaying that their testing attributed the downgraded capabilities to a\nrestriction put in place by Google.\n\n> “Google’s official wireless charger can provide 10W for the newly-released\nPixel 3 and Pixel XL 3, however, according to our quality engineer, Pixel sets\na limitation for a third-party charging accessories and we are afraid that\neven our fast wireless charger can only provide 5W for these 2x devices. Our\nquality team is to purchase this new models to have a try, once we get a test\nanswer, we will keep the product page updated,” Anker reportedly told the\n_Android Police_ reader.\n\nGoogle representatives subsequently confirmed this, telling the site that a\n“secure handshake” was necessary to charge the Pixel 3 and [Pixel 3\nXL](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-3-xl) at 10W – and\nthat only the Pixel Stand knew this particular golf club ritual.\n\n**Related:[Pixel 3 vs Pixel 3\nXL](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/pixel-3-vs-pixel-3-xl-3601343)**\n\nSubsequent clarifications from Google are being sought – including by _Trusted\nReviews_ – as the device also appears to register “Charging rapidly” on its\nscreen regardless of whether it’s supping 10W or 5W juice – which is confusing\nat best, and downright misleading if you’re being less charitable.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: WhatsApp \n\n### The Facebook Effect: WhatsApp says ads coming to Status tab\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/whatsapp-advertisements-status-\ntab-3613630 \"The Facebook Effect: WhatsApp says ads coming to Status tab\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * \n\nThe Pixel Stand sure isn’t cheap at £69 – by way of comparison, a 10W Anker\nwireless charging pad [costs just £18 on Amazon](https://amzn.to/2D11je3),\nalbeit with no additional functionality – so this is a pretty nasty secret if\nGoogle let it, ahem…stand.\n\n**What do you make of the Pixel 3’s apparent wireless charging restrictions?\nLet us know on Twitter @TrustedReviews.**\n\n"}
