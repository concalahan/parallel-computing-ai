After tapping it, you\ncan use your voice to search for music by artist, genre, or album names, or to\ncontrol playback by skipping and pausing tracks.\n\nThis isn’t the first time you’ve been able to control Spotify using your\nvoice, but it’s the first time Spotify has provided the tech itself. Music\ncontinues to be one of the most popular uses for smart speakers like Amazon\nEcho and Google Home, and Spotify is key to this.\n\nGiven that the music app effectively already has voice control, this really\nbegs the question of why Spotify would spend the time and resources to develop\nits own technology.\n\n## Why go it alone?\n\nOne reason could be that although Google Assistant can happily be used with\nSpotify, Apple’s Siri has been kept exclusive to Apple Music. Having its own\nvoice tech could allow for voice control on Apple devices for the first time.\n\nBut potentially this development points towards Spotify developing its own\nhardware, as recent job listings would suggest.\n\n**Related:[Spotify’s music hardware could be right around the\ncorner](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/spotify-music-hardware-announced-\njob-listing-3400221)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nFinally, it could be the case that having its own voice search tech could\nallow for more Spotify-specific voice control options, such as having it play\nyour daily mixes or save songs to playlists — functionality that Alexa and\nGoogle Assistant currently lack. Apple Insider notes that the voice search’s\nfunctionality is currently limited, but given it’s in its testing phase this\ncould and probably will improve.\n\nIf Spotify does indeed plan to release its own voice search technology and\nhardware, it could be bad news for Amazon and Google. A huge worry for those\ntwo companies is that Spotify might eventually stop making its service\navailable on other platforms.\n\nBut the company has a good track record of maintaining support, even when it\noffers a competing service. For example, Spotify still happily works with\nGoogle Cast, despite offering its own Spotify Connect Wi-Fi streaming\nplatform.\n\n**Why do you think Spotify is developing its own voice search functionality?\nLet us know @TrustedReviews.**\n\n"}
