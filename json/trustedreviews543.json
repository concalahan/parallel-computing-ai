What is it, how powerful is it and should you\ncare? We take a look.**\n\n## Nvidia GeForce MX150 – Gaming performance\n\nFor many laptop buyers who like gaming, the promise of dedicated or discrete\ngraphics is like a red flag to a bull: it means extra performance in the\nlatest 3D games. The MX150 is a replacement to the GeForce 940MX that has\nappeared in loads of laptops over the last couple of years. MX150 was first\nannounced in May, but it’s taken until the end of August 2017 to start\nappearing in laptops we can buy.\n\nIt’s also a replacement for any Intel HD (now called UHD) graphics hardware\nthat comes baked into your laptop’s processor. Intel graphics have never been\nknown for their gaming performance, so it’s easy to dismiss nearly every\nlaptop without a discrete GPU as something to avoid.\n\n**Related:[Best gaming laptops](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\ngaming-laptop)**\n\nSo far, we’ve not had an MX150 laptop in to test, but Nvidia has provided some\nits own figures to give you a rough idea of what performance to expect. First\nand foremost, the MX150 is not a high-end GPU. Nvidia’s marketing material on\nthe MX150 only makes mention of playing eSports games such as Dota 2, CS:GO,\nLoL and World of Tanks at Full HD resolution at 60fps.\n\nThe company doesn’t make any claims about what graphical settings you’ll be\nrunning, although this point is fairly moot as we’d recommend you let Nvidia\nGeForce Experience software take over and do the heavy lifting to decide what\ngraphics settings you should be running at.\n\nSo, eSports only, then? Maybe, but we can use some other data to see how more\nadvanced games will run.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nIn our recent review of the [HP Spectre x360\n15](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/hp-spectre-x360-15), we ran some\nbenchmarks on the included 940MX GPU. There we saw performance of 50fps in\nDirty Rally at Full HD, Medium settings, and 30fps in Shadow of Mordor at Full\nHD.\n\nNvidia claims the MX150 is 25% more powerful than the 940MX (and 4x more\npowerful than last-generation Intel HD Graphics 520), so from that we can take\naway that while this GPU isn’t designed for the latest AAA games, it can\ntechnically run them if you dial down graphics settings and/or resolution.\n\nAgain, if the game is supported by GeForce Experience, Nvidia should\nautomatically be able to set your game up for the best performance/eye-candy\ncompromise.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nNvidia marketing material\n\nThe thing you should take into account here is that this GPU will often be\nfound in laptops with relatively low-power 7th- and [8th-generation Intel\nCore](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/intel-8th-gen-core-specs-technology-\nexplained-2952599) CPUs. These chips will often be a bit of a bottleneck for\nyour games – some more advanced titles such as Battlefield 1 – struggle\nwithout a properly beefy processor, no matter how good your GPU is.\n\n## Video and photo editing\n\nThe MX150 is a dab hand at photo editing in Adobe products, according to\nNvidia. The company reckons you’ll be able to crop and remaster photos up to\n2.5x faster than bog-standard Intel HD Graphics, and up to 4x faster colour\nremastering when working with video content.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nNvidia marketing material\n\n## Should I buy a GeForce MX150 laptop?\n\nUntil we’ve tested one for sure we can’t give a definitive verdict, but we can\noffer some general advice. GeForce MX150 will probably find itself in thinner\nand lighter laptops than the full-desktop-style GPUs such as [GTX\n1050](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-gtx-1050) and\n[1050 Ti](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-gtx-1050-ti).\nIf you’re really after a gaming laptop, consider a thicker and heavier\nmachine. If you want thin and light and want to play older or eSports titles,\nthese new MX150 should fit the bill. Check back here when we have more on the\nMX150’s benchmark results.\n\n**Related:[Best gaming PC](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/best-gaming-\npc)**\n\n**Let us know what you think of the Nvidia GeForce MX150 via Facebook or\nTwitter.**\n\n"}
