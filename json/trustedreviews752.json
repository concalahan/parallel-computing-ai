Here’s what you need to know about the new Walkie\nTalkie and Competitions features, improved Notifications, Siri and much more.\n\nDuring the [WWDC 2018\nkeynote](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/wwdc-2018-3399519) in San Jose,\nApple showed off a series of neat updates for its [Apple\nWatch](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/apple-watch-3) range of wearable\ndevices. The new features will arrive under the watchOS 5 banner in September\n2018.\n\nUnfortunately, the first generation Apple Watch will miss out on watchOS 5,\nsignalling the end of support for the three year old timepiece.\n\n## WatchOS 5 Release date: When can I download it?\n\nApple will release the latest version of watchOS alongside the newest\nadditions to the Apple Watch. watchOS 5 is coming on September 17, whereas the\nApple Watch Series 4 goes on sale on September 21.\n\nApple announced the Apple Watch Series 4 alongside the [iPhone\nXS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-xs-release-date-3551351),\n[iPhone XS Max](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-xs-release-date-\nspecs-price-uk-3551351) and iPhone XR at its ‘Gather Round’ event on September\n12 and revealed some new watchOS 5 features along the way.\n\n## Watch OS 5 compatibility: Which watches will it work on?\n\nWatchOS 5 will be the first version of the software that won’t work on all the\nApple Watches. Those of you who still have the original (often referred to as\nthe Apple Watch Series 0) are out of luck.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nWatchOS 5 is compatible with the the following devices. However, a few\nfeatures (see below) will be exclusive to the Apple Watch Series 4.\n\n  * [Apple Watch Series 1](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/apple-watch)\n  * [Apple Watch Series 2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/apple-watch-2) (all versions)\n  * [Apple Watch Series 3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/apple-watch-3) (all versions)\n  * [Apple Watch Series 4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-watch-4-specs-3487177) (all versions)\n\n## WatchOS 5: Competitions in the Activity app\n\nApple introduced Activity Sharing in watchOS 4 and that moves on a step in\nwatchOS 5. Competitions will allow Apple Watch owners to challenge their\nactivity sharing friends to 7-day competitions, based upon their fitness data.\n\nThere’ll be live leaderboards where you can see where you stand, with awards\nfor the winners at the end.\n\nThere’s also new activities to enjoy. There’s a yoga tool that uses your heart\nrate, while the hiking activity will track your pace, heart rate and elevation\ngain.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nRunning has been dramatically improved too. You’ll get a rolling mile pace,\ncustom pace alerts and cadence data in the form of steps taken per minute.\n\nThere’s also automatic workout detection, alongside retroactive credit if you\ndon’t immediately press Start to commence a workout. If the watch senses your\nheart rate is coming down you’ll get a reminder to halt the activity on the\nwatch face.\n\n**Related:[iOS 12](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ios-12-release-date-\nfeatures-3385158) **\n\n## WatchOS 5: Walkie Talkie\n\nApple is also debuting a new Walkie Talkie feature for Apple Watch, enabling\nusers to exchange voice messages with a quick tap on the watch face.\n\nApple Watch owners can chose friends they want to enable the feature with and\nthere’s suggestions from regular contacts. A friend will receive a one-time\nconnection request and after they’ve accepted, the pair will be able to\ncontact each other at any time. Walkie Talkie works over cellular and Wi-Fi.\n\n![walkie talkie Apple\nWatch](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Siri watch face updates\n\nThe Siri watch face, which shows contemporaneous information, is getting much\nbetter in watchOS 5.\n\nApple Watch users can add live sports scores, commute times in Maps and, of\ncourse, the Siri Shortcuts tools revealed as part of the iOS portion of\nApple’s WWDC 2018 presentation.\n\nThere’s also the addition of third-party apps to the Siri watch face for the\nfirst time. So, for example, if you use Nike+ Running at the same time on a\nregular basis, you’ll see it pop up on the Siri watch face.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nApple is also making it easier to talk to your Apple Watch. Now you won’t have\nto say ‘Hey Siri’, you can just lift your wrist and begin talking.\n\n## Notifications in watchOS 5\n\nNotifications are also becoming more interactive in iOS 12. You’ll be able to\ncheck into flights, extend your parking meter, push back table reservations if\nyou’re running late and even pay for rides using Apple May.\n\nApple is also boosting notifications in Messages and Mail. WebKit is now part\nof the deal, meaning you’ll be able to click links sent by contacts. We aren’t\ngetting a proper web browser, but content like restaurant menus will be\nformatted for the small screen and show in reader mode where available.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Podcasts on your wrist\n\nwatchOS 5 also brings the Apple Podcasts app to the wrist. Episodes can be\nautomatically synced or streamed, with playback synced across your Apple\ndevices.\n\nAs well as the addition of Podcasts, Apple is enabling third-party apps to\nplay audio in the background, uninterrupted by your other Apple Watch\nendeavours.\n\n## watchOS 5 – Apple Watch Series 4 features\n\nThe Gather Round event on September 12 introduced the new Apple Watch Series\n4, which offers a larger display. This also includes some new watchOS 5\nfeatures that’ll seemingly (and definitely in some cases) be exclusive to the\nnew model.\n\n**Related:[Apple Watch 4 vs Apple Watch\n3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-watch-4-vs-apple-\nwatch-3-3564950)**\n\nThat larger screen means new watch faces with up to eight complications, which\ncan be infinitely customised, Apple says. You can add things like weather, UVI\nratings, heart rate, timezones, countdown timers, activity rings, your next\nmeeting, music, the date and much much more.\n\n![Apple Watch Series\n4](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nThere’s also a dedicated watch face for the Breathe app, which will guide you\nthrough breathing exercises by following patterns on screen. There’s also\ndynamic fire, water and vapour watch faces that interact with the new edge-to-\nedge display on the Apple Watch Series 4.\n\nMeanwhile, the Modular Face can now be customised with third-party\ncomplications like stocks, sports scores, boarding passes and a snapshot of\nyour nutritional intake. It’s not clear yet whether these watch faces will be\navailable for Apple Watch Series 3 and below.\n\nApple is also adding a feature to catch you when you fall. If the Apple\nWatch’s motion sensors notice you’ve tripped, slipped or fallen down it will\ninitiate a shortcut to call the emergency services. If the same sensors know\nyou haven’t moved in 5 seconds, it’ll automatically start the call.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, are the new heart health features Apple\nis adding in the Apple Watch Series 4. Users will get a notification if their\nheart rate is low or irregular, which could be a warning sign. As these\nfeatures are powered by the optical heart rate sensor featured in earlier\nmodels, it’s possible they will also roll out to users on older devices.\n\nHowever, the new electrocardiogram (ECG) feature is powered by new electrical\nsensors only present on the Apple Watch Series 4. That comes with a special\napp that will enable an ECG at anytime just by placing the finger on the\ndigital crown.\n\n![Apple Watch series 4 ECG\nEKG](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## watchOS 5 – What else is new?\n\nApple Watch owners will be able to customise the button arrangements of their\nphone and even access their student ID cards via the Apple Watch. A number of\nuniversities will begin testing this feature later this year, which will\nenable students to gain entry to dorms, dining halls and events.\n\nUsers will also be able to answer FaceTime calls as audio, add cities to\nweather, access a new emoji picker, access air quality and wind\ndirection/speed in the weather app, add stocks, customise the control centre\nand much more.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Will this update convince you to grab an Apple Watch?
