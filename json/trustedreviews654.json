[Beyond Good and Evil\n2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/beyond-good-and-evil-2-release-\ndate-2993129) saw a fantastic new trailer and introduced a familiar face\nhardcore fans will adore. Trials Rising was announced as the latest entry in\nRed Lynx’s motor-cross series, and it looks fittingly absurd. Having already\nreceived a gameplay demonstration at Microsoft’s briefing, [The Division\n2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/the-division-2-release-date-3415602)\ninstead received a cinematic trailer and details on its post-launch plans. In\nshort, everything will be free!\n\nPirating adventure Skull and Bones received its first major update in over a\nyear and Nintendo made a brief appearance to announce Starfox for Starlink:\nBattle for Atlas, a new toys-to-life venture by Ubisoft. The star of the show\nwas undoubtedly [Assassin’s Creed\nOdyssey](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/assassins-creed-odyssey-release-\ndate-gameplay-3480002). Set in Ancient Greece, we were treated to a lush\nreveal trailer and plenty of gameplay ahead of the October 5 release. All in\nall, Ubisoft managed to impress like it always does.\n\n## Ubisoft E3 2018 press conference video – Watch the event for yourself\n\nAlthough the event is now over, you can relive it in all its glory below.\n\n## Ubisoft E3 2018 press conference liveblog – As it happened\n\n**21:01:** The Ubisoft press conference has begun, and some snark has already\nbeen thrown at leaks having emerged before the show.

We hope so, as Ubisoft has started\nwith a bang with some incredibly talented dancers making their way into the\ntheatre. They’re presumably here to announce Just Dance 2019.\n\n**2104:** It’s still going. Considering the popularity of Just Dance across a\nslew of platforms, it’s no surprise to see Ubisoft giving it pride and place\nat this year’s conference.\n\n**2106:** The dancing is finally over! Now we’ve got a new trailer for Beyond\nGood and Evil 2 , a project announced in 2017 after years of the project being\nshrouded in mystery. The CG trailer is absolutely stunning, featuring the same\nensemble cast of characters we encountered in the reveal trailer. Check it out\nbelow and witness the return of a beloved character:\n\n**2112:** Ubisoft builds upon the trailer with a glimpse at Beyond Good and\nEvil 2 in a pre-alpha state, so you can expect some of the stuff being shown\nto change before the final product. Players can explore an absolutely massive\nworld on foot or via spaceship, and it looks hugely ambitious. Ubisoft is\nissuing an open invitation through the Space Monkey Program, where budding\ncreators can contribute to the development of Beyond Good and Evil 2.\n\n**2216:**[Rainbow Six Siege](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/rainbow-\nsix-siege) takes to the stage now. The popular tactical shooter has grown\nmassively, having recently passed 35 million players worldwide. Operation\nParabellum, the latest expansion, is playable right now across PS4, Xbox One\nand PC.\n\n**2221:** A motorcycle has entered the theatre. Ubisoft is certainly full of\nsurprises this year. This was all in anticipation for a new Trials\nannouncement. It’s back and bigger than ever in Trials Rising. It will be more\naccessible for newcomers with new tutorials, while veterans can still expect\nthe same number of creative challenge in Rising. A closed beta is happening\nlater this year ahead of a February 2019 release for PS4, Xbox One, PC and\nNintendo Switch.\n\n**2128:** The creative director for Tom Clancy’s The Division 2 is here.\nTaking place in Washington D.C, it’s a stark visual difference to the\noriginal. You can watch the new cinematic trailer below:\n\n**2134:** The Division 2 will feature three unique paths of specialisations\nafter the main campaign is over. This will grant you new weapons and a mode of\nprogression that allows you to be the soldier you want to be. Raids are also\ncoming to The Division 2 as the “ultimate endgame challenge” Three DLC\nepisodes are planned for The Division 2, and they will be free for everyone!\nIt’s coming to PS4, Xbox One and PC on March 15, 2019.\n\n**2139:** Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle is receiving an expansion featuring\neveryone’s favourite monkey: Donkey Kong. To celebrate the announcement,\ncomposer Grant Kirkhope is on stage alongside a live orchestra. Yep, it’s\ndefinitely E3. Oh, and it’s coming on June 26.\n\n**2146:**[Skull and Bones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/skull-and-\nbones-release-date-2993779) has received a new trailer, proving that piracy\nisn’t dead after all. The new cinematic trailer is something to behold, too:\n\n**2151:** Skull and Bones takes the ship combat first introduced in Assassin’s\nCreed and builds it into a fully-fledged experiences. Your ship is fully\ncustomisable as you embark on missions and engage in skirmishes with other\nplayers. It looks fun, and it’s not often we see a swashbuckling adventure\nlike this.\n\n**2156:** Elijah Wood, creative director of Transference is here alongside the\ngame director to talk about their upcoming project. The first-person narrative\nadventure has you switching between different members of the same family and\ninto the consciousness of one another.\n\n**2158:** Coming to virtual reality and traditional platforms, Transference\nseems like a psychological thriller we’re very eager to sink our teeth into.\nIt’s also wonderful to see Ubisoft diving into such unorthodox projects. It’s\ncoming in Fall 2018.\n\n**2200:** Now it’s time for a gameplay trailer of Starlink: Battle for Atlas.\nThe toys-to-life sci-fi shooter looks very serious, and the way in which\nyou’ll use the real life figurines seems genuinely creative. Set to launch in\nOctober 2018, we don’t have long to wait:\n\nStarfox was probably a huge inspiration for Starlink, so it seems fitting that\nthe furry hero is coming to Starlink: Battle For Atlas as a playable\ncharacter. He’s exclusive to Switch, though. Shigeru Miyamoto, the creator of\nZelda, Mario and Starfox is also in the audience.\n\n**1007:** It’s time for a brief update on For Honor. Starting today and until\nnext week, the Starter Edition of For Honor is available for free on uPlay. No\ncatch, just log in and download it right now. For Honor is also expanding its\nhorizons with a new expansion – Marching Fire. It’s the team’s biggest and\nmost ambition addition thus far.\n\n**2214:**[The Crew 2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/the-crew-2) is\nlaunching in only a couple weeks time, and an open beta is coming to all\nplatforms on June 21. You can preload the trial right now if you’re extra\nkeen.\n\n**2216:** After already leaking through a keyring in recent weeks, Assassin’s\nCreed Odyssey has finally been confirmed with its debut trailer. It looks\npretty stunning, and seems to build upon the template introduced by Origins in\n2017. You can play as two characters in Odyssey: Alexios or Cassandra.\n\n**2227:** Now it’s time for an extensive gameplay demonstration for Assassin’s\nCreed Odyssey. It seems to play in a similar fashion to Origins in terms of\ncombat and exploration. That being said, there are plenty of flashy skills and\nweapons being used. Oh, and it’s positively gorgeous. Dialogue options are a\nmajor new feature, suggesting that players will have plenty of moral decisions\nto make.\n\n**What did you think of Ubisoft at E3 2018?
