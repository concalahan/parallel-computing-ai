It’s nicknamed Mojave after the famous\nCalifornian desert. Here’s a look at some of the best new macOS 10.14 Mojave\nfeatures.\n\nWe already knew that **Dark Mode** would be coming to the operating system,\nwhich can currently be found on the company’s lineup of notebook and desktop\nPCs. Dark Mode does what it says on the tin – it makes elements like menus,\nfolder backgrounds and other UI elements darker. This is great for workers\nburning the candle at both ends, as this should lessen eye strain.\nTheoretically, darker UI elements should also place slightly less strain on\nyour MacBook’s batteries, too.\n\n![A screengrab of Apple's 'Dark Mode' feature from macOS 10.14\nMojave.](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n**Related:[iPhone XR vs iPhone XS vs iPhone XS\nMax](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-xr-vs-iphone-xs-vs-iphone-xs-\nmax-3565104)**\n\nWe got further details of how Dark Mode would work, and MacOS’s default apps\nsuch as Mail and Xcode were shown off using the new display mode.\n\nThe announcement that Apple News, which we first saw on iOS 9, would be coming\nto the Mac was also spoiled by leaks.\n\nHowever, we didn’t know about the new ‘Stacks’ feature, which will allow you\nto instantly arrange everything in your desktop into organised sections of\ndocuments. Finder’s new ‘Gallery’ view was also unannounced, and allows you to\nquickly view important details and complete Quick Actions with your files such\nas rotating images.\n\nThese quick actions can also be customised to allow you to quickly watermark\nan image or document if you need to perform that action on a regular basis.\n\nThe most interesting upgrade will be coming to Screenshots, which you’ll now\nbe able to use to record short videos in addition to static images. You can\nalso double-click a screenshot the moment you’ve taken it in order to quickly\nedit it.\n\nContinuity Camera will seamlessly let you click a button on your machine to\neasily take a photo using your phone and transfer it to MacOS.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nA new Home app will bring HomeKit support to the Mac, so you can control and\nmonitor your smart home from your computer for the first time.\n\nSafari will also be updated to prevent web cookies from tracking you across\nthe internet. You can still use your Facebook account to comment on websites,\nbut you’ll have to give the website permission to do so first via a popup that\nthe browser will generate. Apple will also introduce features to reduce the\nability for websites to track you via your digital ‘fingerprint’.\n\nThe operating system’s App Store will also be updated. The store will have a\nnew UI, and reviews and ratings will be made easier to leave.\n\nApple doesn’t charge for its operating system updates, so anyone with a\ncompatible Mac will be able to download the software free of charge when it\nreleases.\n\n## MacOS 10.14 Mojave Release Date: When does macOS 10.14 come out?\n\nThe macOS Mojave operating system has been in beta since WWDC, but it will be\nofficially released on September 24.\n\n**What do you think of the new version of MacOS?
