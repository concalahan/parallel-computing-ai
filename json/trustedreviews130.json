Here are\nour favourites.**\n\nCorsair’s is probably one of the best-known PC gaming brands around, with\nproducts that cover the entire ecosystem, from cases to power supplies to the\ntiny little liquid cooling pipe connectors you use for building your custom\ncooling solution.  \n**  \nRelated:[Best desktop PCs to buy right\nnow](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-desktop-pc_round-up \"Best desktop\")**\n\nThe company also recently re-entered the pre-built gaming PC space with the\namazing, tiny [Corsair One](https://www.trustedreviews.com/corsair-one-review\n\"Corsair One review\"). But at Computex 2017 went back to its big PC roots with\nsome amazing concept pieces that prove PC gaming can be beautiful.\n\nFirst up, Concept Slate. This behemoth of a PC case is actually ready to house\ntwo complete systems, thanks to an extra compartment for a mini-ITX\nmotherboard, compact power supply and graphics card. The complete system build\nhas 24 fans in total, but there’s room for even more if you want them. In\nCorsair’s dream build, both systems are liquid-cooled with their own\nindependent systems.\n\n![Corsair Concept\nSlate](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)![Corsair Concept\nSlate](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)![Corsair Concept\nSlate](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)_That right there is the secondary PC, buried inside\nthe first_\n\nThe second is Concept Curve. This is a more “normal” build that uses hand-\nfinished carbon fibre and curved, tempered glass for a ridiculously stylish\nrig. The system is based on the Graphite 780T case and comes complete with a\nliquid cooling system and Corsair’s RGB LED fans. Corsair describes it as a\n“supercar”, and we can’t disagree on that.  \n![Corsair Concept\nCurve](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)![Corsair Concept\nCurve](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)![Corsair Concept\nCurve](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe Corsair Bulldog GTO is a modified Bulldog PC that’s been turned into a\nfully-fledged hot rod. Complete with headlights and flashing blinkers, the\nsystem was built to showcase the firm’s new Torque memory, which itself was\ninspired by hot rods.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n![Corsair hot\nrod](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIt’s not a PC, but the Concept Zeus mouse and mousepad are interesting in\ntheir own way. The pad comes with a small Qi wireless charging spot, which can\ncharge compatible phones, and any other phone for that matter with the\nincluded Qi dongle. What’s more, the Zeus gaming mouse comes with Qi charging\nbuilt in, so you can leave your mouse on the spot and never run out of juice,\nand never plug in again.\n\n![Corsair Concept\nZeus](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIt’s early days still, and Corsair wants to make the charging spot bigger and\nmore powerful, but we can imagine lots of gamers being excited by this piece.\nof kit. Let’s hope it makes it into production.\n\n"}
