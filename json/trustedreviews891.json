Thankfully, series\ncreator Kazunori Yamauchi has already confirmed a new GT game is in the works.\n\nEven if there’s a long wait ahead of us, we’re more than ready for another\nride, so _Trusted Reviews_ has compiled everything you need to know alongside\nall the latest news, reveals and our very own wishlist.\n\n**Related:**[ **Forza Horizon 4\nwishlist**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/forza-horizon-4-release-date-\nnews-trailer-gameplay-wishlist-cars-3382198)\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Gran Turismo 7 release date\n\nA launch window for Gran Turismo 7 hasn’t been discussed by Sony nor Polyphony\nDigital. It will be exclusive to Sony platforms and will likely be coming to\n[PS4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/playstation-4) or perhaps the\nillusive [PS5](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ps5-release-date-price-\ngames-news-rumours-specs-2993694) depending on how far down the road it makes\nan appearance.\n\n## Gran Turismo 7 news\n\nPolyphony Digital CEO Kazunori Yamauchi confirmed in an interview with\nJapanese publication [Game\nWatch](https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/interview/1103429.html) that work\non the next Gran Turismo instalment has begun. “[I] cannot talk about anything\nyet, but since the moment of releasing GT [Sport], I have started making the\nnext GT,” Yamauchi said.\n\n**Related:**[ **Upcoming PS4\nGames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/upcoming-ps4-games)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Gran Turismo Sport wishlist\n\n**A more realistic damage model**\n\nDespite being a realistic simulator, Gran Turismo has never adopted a damage\nmodel representative of how it’d actually be if you crashed a fancy Ferrari\ninto a brick wall. Of course, you need to take some liberties so the vehicles\nstill remain playable after a bit of damage, but seeing it reflected in some\nform of aesthetic or mechanical manner would be great.\n\nGran Turismo has a huge variety of different cars so this model would reflect\ndifferently on whatever you choose. For example, a super-car might be hindered\nfar easier than a formidable Range Rover designed to take some punishment. For\npurists, an option to switch off such a feature could also be included.\n\n**Dynamic weather system**\n\nOne of the finest things about PS4 exclusive Driveclub was its absolutely\ngorgeous weather system. It remains of the best-looking things on Sony’s\nconsole and is a joy to witness. This made the absence of something similar in\nGran Turismo Sport a bitter pill to swallow.\n\nDespite possessing lovingly crafted car models , they lacked a sense of life\nwhen driving through bland environments. Gran Turismo 7 is in a perfect\nposition to implement such a system, and we’re sure it’ll look gorgeous on\n[PS4 Pro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/ps4-pro).\n\n**Related:**[ **God of War**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/god-of-\nwar-ps4)\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**A bigger, more meaningful campaign**\n\nGran Turismo 7 should have a solo campaign that’s more than just a sequence of\ngeneric events with little flavour or variety. There was an ample number of\nthem available in GT Sport and beating them was incredibly satisfying, but\nthey all felt relatively similar in the end.\n\nWhat about a meaningful narrative or progression system alongside the usual\nsimulator fare. It has the potential to provide a series that has maintained\nthe same tone for almost two decades with something new and exciting.\n\n**Let us beep the horns!**\n\nThis is a bit of a silly complaint, but not being able to beep our precious\nhorns in Gran Turismo Sport was a gaming tragedy. You can pop on your\nindicators and all that good stuff but it seems Polyphony Digital frown upon a\ncheeky horn or two.\n\nWe really want this feature to return so we can bug our friends both on the\nsofa and online.\n\n**Related:**[ **Days Gone** ](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/days-gone-\nrelease-date-gameplay-trailer-pre-order-ps4-pro-2993135)\n\n_**What’s on your wishlist for Gran Turismo 7?
