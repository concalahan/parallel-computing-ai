There’s the roof, and there’s thebasement, and there’s a secret spot under the stairs in the basement. You’relooking at an average of up to four chests per run. The downside, of course,being everyone else knows this and you’ll have a massive scrap on your handsas other players all fight for the same prize.

There’s a chest under the treein the square garden area. Several more in the buildings at the back. The bestbet? Keep an eye out for the small buildings slightly to the East.
