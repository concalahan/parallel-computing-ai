The upcoming action title will be the first work by Hideo\nKojima, the creator of Metal Gear Solid, since departing from Konami in 2015.\nThe Walking Dead’s Norman Reedus stars as the game’s lead in a seemingly war-\ntorn world filled with all sorts of unusual phenomena.\n\nThe above 8-minute clip is beautifully presented and incredibly grotesque,\nshowcasing Sam, the character of Norman Reedus, as he and a few others are\nattacked by an unknown alien force. The invisible adversaries drag one poor\nsoul away before the other is pulled into the air, desperately stabbing\nhimself to death so he isn’t taken alive. What might happen to him is anyone’s\nguess.\n\nWe won’t spoil the rest of the trailer, but it begins and ends with a line\nfrom Norman Reedus that shines a fascinating light on what Death Stranding\nmight be about:\n\n_**“Once there was an explosion, a bang which gave birth to time and space.\nOnce there was an explosion, a bang which set a planet spinning in that space.\nOnce there was an explosion, a bang which gave rise to life as we know it. And\nthen, came the next explosion.”**_\n\nFans on the [official\nReddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeathStranding/comments/7ic101/death_stranding_game_awards_2017_trailer/)\nhave already begun theorizing what this quote could mean, linking it to the\nBig Bang as the initial creation of life and the second potentially referenced\nthe asteroid that wiped out prehistoric life on Earth. Finally, the third\ncould be another meteor, as presented by the crater at the end of Death\nStranding’s latest trailer.\n\nThe aforementioned meteor may have contained an alien organism that feeds on\nother lifeforms to survive, which explains accelerated ageing and the need to\ncling onto genetically modified embryo (the weird babies attached to Norman’s\nchest) to survive and reverse the effects. The potential outcomes are\nplentiful, and we can’t wait to find out more.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Death Stranding release date – when is it coming out?\n\nA release date for Death Stranding remains unconfirmed. Hideo Kojima confirmed\nthat it will be released before the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, so perhaps a 2019\nrelease date is on the cards?\n\nDeath Stranding was a major focus at E3 2018 alongside [The Last of Us\n2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/last-of-us-2-release-date-gameplay-\ntrailer-pre-order-news-wishlist-2944236), [Spider-\nMan](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/spiderman-ps4-2993195) and [Ghosts of\nTsushima](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ghost-of-tsushima-release-date-\ntrailers-story-3319443).\n\n## Death Stranding gameplay – how does it play?\n\nHideo Kojima and Kojima Productions stated on\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/KojiPro2015_EN/status/743467989484244993/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\nthat Death Stranding will try and go beyond the traditional definition of\n“action” and “RPG” found in similar games. This confirms to us that Death\nStranding is certainly ambitious, and won’t be like anything Kojima has done\nbefore.\n\nHideo Kojima has said that Death Stranding will be an open-world action game\nwith online elements. It will also have the trademark storytelling you’d want\nfrom a Kojima project, so expect something surreal, silly and over-the-top.\n\nKojima has explained “with Death Stranding, I’d like to offer the next step,\nthe future of gaming” with gameplay and storytelling that goes beyond genre\nconventions. It also appears Guillermo Del Toro is more involved with the\nproject than we first thought.\n\nFinally, Kojima has confirmed that Death Stranding has entered “full-blown\ndevelopment” at Kojima Productions, but it’s still a while off.\n\n**Related:[Call of Duty Black Ops 4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/call-\nof-duty-black-ops-4-3373836) **\n\nHideo Kojima confirmed during a panel at [PlayStation Experience\n2016](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/playstation-experience-2016-all-the-\nnews-and-announcements) that Death Stranding will use the Decima Engine, the\nsame tech used to power [Horizon: Zero\nDawn](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/horizon-zero-dawn-release-date-\ntrailer-gameplay-preorder) on PS4.\n\nKojima Productions is working close with Guerilla Games on the development of\nDeath Stranding, so much so that Kojima has been provided with the source code\nto the engine. Everything we’ve seen of Death Stranding thus far has been\nrunning directly on PS4 Pro, setting a high benchmark for the finished\nexperience.\n\n## Death Stranding trailer – How does it look?\n\nThe first trailer for Death Stranding is running in real-time on PS4, which is\nrather impressive considering the detailed motion capture and environments on\ndisplay.\n\nDespite being overly cryptic, the unusual mixture of disturbing visuals and\nhaunting music leave a powerful impression, and we expect nothing less from\nHideo Kojima.\n\n**Pre-order Death Stranding from[Amazon UK](http://amzn.to/2EDRHTA) |\n[Amazon.com](http://amzn.to/2GpXsVA)**\n\nNext up is The Game Awards 2016 trailer, which reveals Mads Mikkelsen as Death\nStranding’s main antagonist:\n\n_**Death Stranding has us excited, how about you?
