Well it’s the same old story – reports suggest\nthe Snapdragon 810 is facing serious overheating issues, mirroring last year’s\nchatter.\n\nFor starters, Korea’s media is rife with rumours that Qualcomm is struggling\nto mass-produce the Snapdragon 810, as noted by\n[GForGames](http://www.gforgames.com/gadgets/snapdragon-810-issues-mass-\nproduction-postponed-46047/).\n\nWhat’s more, the [Korea\nTimes](http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/tech/2015/01/133_171341.html) puts\nit down to the fact that overheating is limited performance, as discovered by\nGeekbench reports.\n\nA separate [report](http://blogs.barrons.com/asiastocks/2015/01/07/tsmc-jp-\nmorgan-sees-little-downside-from-qualcomms-snapdragon-\ndelay/?mod=google_news_blog), courtesy of J.P. Morgan analysts, proposes that\nboth the Snapdragon 615 and the Snapdragon 810 are suffering overheating\nissues, although it’s a more persistent issue on the latter chipset.\n\n**Related:** [Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 gets Cat.9 LTE\nsupport](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/qualcomm-snapdragon-810-gets-\ncat-9-lte-support)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThe Snapdragon 810 is an octa-core chip, laid out in ARM’s big.LITTLE\nconfiguration.\n\nThis means that four of the cores are Cortex-A53, and the other four are\nCortex-A57.\n\nApparently, it’s the four Cortex-A57 cores that are giving Qualcomm a\nproduction headache, as they’re overheating when the clock-rate goes north of\n1.2-1.4GHz.\n\nAnalysts say TSMC – the firm that actually builds Qualcomm’s chips – will be\npushing back the Snapdragon 810 production schedule back by around three\nmonths.\n\nThis will give them enough time to redesign some of the chip’s metal layers,\nalthough it could mean there won’t be an abundance of chips until halfway\nthrough 2015.\n\n_TrustedReviews_ spoke to Qualcomm yesterday out at CES. Although the chipset\nmanufacturer did not discuss potential 810 delays, the company did assure us\nthe processor would be in ‘multiple’ devices later this quarter and moving\ninto Q2.\n\n**Related:** [CES 2015: What’s happened at the Las Vegas tech expo so\nfar?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/hubs/ces-2015)\n\nQualcomm announced its upcoming flagship Snapdragon 810 chip last year, with\nthe new tech boating Adreno 430 graphics, 64-bit architecture support,\nimproved battery life, and 4K video support.\n\nWe’re expecting the chip to show up many of this year’s top smartphones,\nincluding the [LG G4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-g4-release-date-\nrumours-news-specs-and-price), the [Sony Xperia\nZ4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/sony-xperia-z4-release-date-rumours-\nnews-specs-and-price), and the [Samsung Galaxy\nS6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s6-release-date-\nrumours-news-specs-and-price).\n\nFortunately for Samsung however, it has its own supercharged Exynos chip in\nthe works that’s been [rumoured to debut in the Galaxy\nS6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s6-to-land-with-\ncat-10-lte-reports-suggest).\n\n"}
