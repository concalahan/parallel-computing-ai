Unlike the Pixel 2 XL or [SamsungGalaxy S9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s8), thePixel 2 has a huge chin and forehead above and beneath its 5-inch display. Thebezel here is more substantial than seen on the likes of the [iPhone8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-8). Overall, the Pixel 2isn’t much smaller than the Samsung Galaxy S9 or Huawei P20, but those sportmuch bigger 5.8-inch screens.It seems odd that Google has taken this design route, especially since moreand more device makers are opting for a bezel-less look. At least Google hasused that extra space on both ends of the phone to add dual front-facingstereo speakers – but it’s still hard to forgive.The Pixel 2 lags behind most flagships with IP67 (rather than somecompetitors’ [IP68)](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/what-is-ip68-ip-ratings-explained-2947135) dust and water resistance but the practicalimplications of a lesser IP rating are slight and having something isundoubtedly better than nothing.Another, less desirable trend that Google has decided to follow is the removalof the headphone jack. I can only assume that the decision was taken to helpfacilitate the phone’s water resistance but it’s a shame nonetheless. Eventhough you get a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter in the box and there are plenty of‘Made for Google’ USB-C headphones out there, it’s still annoying.## Google Pixel 2 – Screen![Google Pixel2](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/10/DSCF9267-1024x683.jpg)There isn’t a whole lot to get excited about with regards to the Pixel 2’sscreen. As in the first iteration of the device, it’s a 5-inch, 1080p AMOLEDpanel that looks good but you couldn’t call it stunning.AMOLED panels are renowned for offering more saturated colours, perfect blacksand better contrast over their LCD counterparts, but Google likely opted forOLEDs on both Pixel 2s as it’s necessary for [DaydreamVR](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/daydream-vr-3148686) – which receiveda big push around the phone’s launch.**Related:[Best VR headset](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-vr-headset)**I’m a huge fan of AMOLED displays but they’re not perfect. The panel on thePixel 2 edges towards the warm side, so you’ll likely find that whites willhave a slightly orange tinge. Note that Google doesn’t offer any option toadjust colours on the display, which is annoying if you prefer a slightlycooler screen.### Best Google Pixel 2 & Pixel 2 XL Deals[](https://www.giftcloud.com/uk/affiliates/mobilescouk/1125/capture?anpid=277673)[](https://www.giftcloud.com/uk/affiliates/mobilescouk/1125/capture?anpid=277673)###[Google Pixel 2 XL – 4GB, £23pm, £310 upfront on Vodafone (Exclusive £25 giftcard)](https://www.giftcloud.com/uk/affiliates/mobilescouk/1125/capture?anpid=277673)A great deal on the Pixel 2 XL with a nice and low monthly cost.

The ability to play back HDR10 and Dolby Vision contentfrom the likes of Amazon and Netflix is available on the [Galaxy Note9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-9), [LGG7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/lg-g7) and [Apple’s iPhoneXS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xs) – but it isn’t availableon the Pixel 2. This is by no means a deal-breaker but it’s an odd feature toleave out when Google Play Movies and YouTube offer HDR support.[ Next  Performance and Software ](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-2-performance-and-software)"}
