Worse still, ****there’s a chance the patch could cause your\nsystem’s performance to suffer. Here’s everything we know so far about the\nMeltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities.**\n\nIntel has, perhaps unsurprisingly, dismissed complaints of compromised\nperformance as exaggerated, saying in a prepared\n[statement](https://newsroom.intel.com/news/intel-responds-to-security-\nresearch-findings/) that any dip in processing power caused by the patch is\npurely “workload-dependent and, for the average user, should not be\nsignificant.”\n\nIt adds that the issue is not unique to its hardware, but rather that “…many\ntypes of computing devices — with many different vendors’ processors and\noperating systems — are susceptible to these exploits.”\n\nSo exactly what is the flaw and who’s right?\n\nWell, there are actually two separate flaws – and Intel is correct in saying\nthat it’s not the only chip manufacturer affected. It certainly seems to be\nthe _worst_ hit, but the single biggest myth about the so-called ‘Intel chip\nproblem’ is that it’s all Intel’s fault.\n\nAllow us to explain.\n\nThe Intel-specific vulnerability has been dubbed Meltdown, and if unaddressed,\ncould provide malicious applications with a direct passage into your machine’s\nkernel memory data. This is the protected part of your computer used to store\nsensitive material, like login credentials – usernames and passwords – and\ncredit card information, in an unencrypted format.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nIt’s thought to be relatively easy to implement Meltdown, as this proof-of-\nconcept attack shows.\n\n**Related:[CES 2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ces-2018-news-\nrumours-dates-3350586)**\n\n> Using\n[#Meltdown](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Meltdown?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\nto steal passwords in real time\n[#intelbug](https://twitter.com/hashtag/intelbug?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n[#kaiser](https://twitter.com/hashtag/kaiser?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n[#kpti](https://twitter.com/hashtag/kpti?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) /cc\n[@mlqxyz](https://twitter.com/mlqxyz?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n[@lavados](https://twitter.com/lavados?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n[@StefanMangard](https://twitter.com/StefanMangard?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n[@yuvalyarom](https://twitter.com/yuvalyarom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n<https://t.co/gX4CxfL1Ax>\n[pic.twitter.com/JbEvQSQraP](https://t.co/JbEvQSQraP)\n\n>\n\n> — Michael Schwarz (@misc0110) [January 4,\n2018](https://twitter.com/misc0110/status/948706387491786752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nThe underlying vulnerability, however, is understood to affect nearly all\nmicroprocessors. It’s known as Spectre and, while harder to exploit, is\narguably scarier as it’s rooted in fundamental processor design flaws that\naffect not only Intel but ARM, AMD and other chip makers.\n\nAccording to some cybersecurity experts, fixing Spectre will require a\ncomplete overhaul of the way chips are made and could take years.\n\n> 6\\. Spectre will require a complete re-architecture of the way processors\nare designed and the threats posed will be with us for an entire hardware\nlifecycle, likely the next decade.\n\n>\n\n> — Nicole Perlroth (@nicoleperlroth) [January 3,\n2018](https://twitter.com/nicoleperlroth/status/948686265477685248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n**Related:[Best Intel processor](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/best-\nintel-processor-core-i3-i5-i7-2937692)**\n\nThe aforementioned Windows update is currently available for computers running\nWindows 10, but won’t reach units powered by an older build of the operating\nsystem – Windows 7 and [Windows\n8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/windows-8), for example – until\nJanuary 9.
