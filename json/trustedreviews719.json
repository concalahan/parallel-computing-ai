Here’s everything you need to know about the processors\nincluding prices, specs and performance.**\n\n**Key points (Click to jump to section)**\n\n  * **NEW:** Chips go on sale and we conduct our initial review\n  * Official price and specs of desktop chips\n  * Selection of laptops revealed to be running 8th-gen chips\n  * Intel doubles number of processor cores on laptop chips\n  * New chips are response to AMD’s upcoming Ryzen Mobile\n  * Revealed laptop chips are 40% more powerful than 7th-gen equivalents and twice as fast as five-year-old equivalents\n  * Line-up is mix of different Intel architectures for the first time\n\n##  Intel Coffee Lake official specs and prices details\n\nIntel had already unveiled its 8th-gen laptop processors, but this time we’ve\ngot the first set of official details for the brand new “Coffee Lake” 8th-gen\ndesktop chips. If you’re interested in the laptop parts, which are quite\ndifferent, scroll down to the next section.\n\nIf you want to skip to our Coffee Lake review in progress, click here for our\nfirst look at[ Core i7-8700K](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/intel-\ncore-i7-8700k-review-8th-gen-coffee-lake-takes-on-amd-ryzen) with performance\nfigures versus AMD Ryzen\n\nFor now, Intel has only released the details of what it calls its “premium\nperformance” line; they’re the chips that Intel is aiming at gamers. All of\nthese chips use the Coffee Lake architecture, which is the replacement of the\nolder Kaby Lake. Confusingly, Kaby Lake is still used for laptop chips. In\nshort, if Kaby Lake was a refined version of Skylake, Coffee Lake is a super-\nduper refinement (also known as 14nm++).\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThis year, for the first time in a long time, Intel’s performance crown is\nunder threat from AMD’s Ryzen line-up. To compete, Intel is expanding its\nrange of unlocked processors and is upping the core count. This is the\nofficial spec list of all the new desktop processors that went on sale October\n6, along with their UK pricing.\n\n| **Cores/Threads** | **Base clock (GHz)** | **Turbo all cores/one core\n(GHz)** | **L3 cache** | **TDP** | **Price**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n**i7-8700K** |  6/12 | 3.7 | 4.3/4.7 | 12MB | 95W | £360  \n**i7-8700** |  6/12 | 3.2 | 4.3/4.6 | 12MB | 65W | £330  \n**i5-8600K** |  6/6 | 3.6 | 4.1/4.3 | 9MB | 95W | £270  \n**i5-8400** |  6/6 | 2.8 | 3.8/4 | 9MB | 65W | £180  \n**i3-8350K** |  4/4 | 4 | N/A | 6MB | 91W | £170  \n**i3-8100** |  4/4 | 3.6 | N/A | 6MB | 65W | £110  \n  \nThe clear difference this year is the number of cores that each chip has. Now,\nthe i7 range has six cores, with Hyper-threading giving 12 threads; the Core\ni5 range has six cores but no Hyper-threading; and the Core i3 range is now a\nquad-core brand. As far as pricing goes, despite the extra cores, prices\nhaven’t increased horribly over last year. Right now you can grab a Core\ni7-7700K for around £320, while its six-core successor, the 8700K, looks to\ncost around £350 in UK money including taxes. That’s not bad at all\nconsidering the expected massive performance increase.\n\nOf course, Intel is promising that the new Coffee Lake range will have\nconsiderably better performance than Kaby Lake. First, Intel has boosted\nsingle-core performance through a combination of architecture optimisations\nand higher Turbo speeds. Comparing the Core i7-8700K with the Core i7-7700K,\nIntel has said that gamers can expect up to 25 per cent higher frame rate in\nGears of War 4. Multi-tasking has also been increased, largely thanks to the\nadditional cores, with Intel quoting up to 45 per cent better performance in\nPlayerunknown’s Battleground, and up to 32 per cent faster video editing.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAs well as the core count change and performance enhancements, Intel is\npromising better overclocking controls for anyone wanting to get more out of\ntheir CPU. With any multi-core processors, the manufacturing process typically\nmeans that some cores can handle a higher overclock than others. Now, with\nCoffee Lake, you get per-core overclocking to let you get the best out of each\ncore. The max memory ratio has been improved to 8,400MT/s, and there’s real-\ntime latency control, so settings can be tweaked without requiring a reboot.\nIntel has updated its Extreme Tuning Utility and Extreme Memory Profile, too.\nWe’ll have to see how far the new chips can be pushed when we run our full\nreview.\n\nIntel has said that each processor has a GPU that is architecturally the same\nas on Kaby Lake. You can expect slightly better performance due to higher\nclock speeds and better-optimised drivers, although Intel didn’t release the\nfull specifications. Not that onboard GPU’s at this level are particularly\ninteresting, as the vast majority of people that buy one of these chips will\nalso have a discrete graphics card.\n\n**Related:[Best motherboard](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nmotherboard)**\n\nThe other thing that’s worth keeping in mind ahead of the 8th-gen desktop chip\nlaunch is that it will require a new chipset, called Z370. This means the Z270\nchipset that was introduced for Kaby Lake is already defunct and won’t accept\nany newer processors. That’s a bit of a bummer for anybody who made what they\nwere hoping was a long-term investment in a Z270 motherboard. Intel sites\npower delivery requirements for the new chips as the reason behind the change.\nAs a result of this, Skylake and Kaby Lake processors will not be compatible\nwith Z370 motherboards, either. Z370 will also up supported memory speed to\nDDR4-2666.\n\nIntel has said that Z370 will support USB 3.1 Gen 1 (up to 5Gb/s) rather than\nthe newer 10Gb/s USB 3.1 Gen 2. It’s likely, as usual, that the faster ports\nwill be provided by OEM motherboard manufacturers on some models of board.\nThere’s also Thunderbolt 3 integrated into the chipset. Intel continues to\npush its Optane Memory technology, with the fast SSD cache helping to boost\nthe speed of systems with mechanical storage. Optane Memory can make quite a\ndifference, although it seems to us as though most people buying these high-\nend chips would be better off investing in a fast SSD.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAll of the announced processors will be available on 5 October 2017, both in\nretail and OEM PCs. General desktop chips will not be available until the\nfirst half of 2018, with more details to come. We’ll have a review of the\nfirst Coffee Lake chips soon.\n\n##  Intel 8th-generation Core laptops\n\nIntel’s first drip of information on its new 8th-generation chips will be\nmusic to the ears of people looking to buy a laptop before the start of 2018.\nFrom 7th-generation ‘Kaby Lake’ to 8th-gen ‘Kaby Lake’ (you read that right,\nwe’ll explain later, we promise), Intel is claiming a “once in a decade”\nperformance boost of 40% generation-over-generation.\n\nWhen you look at the figures, it’s easy to see why. The first four chips\nrevealed are from the U-series of [Core\ni](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/best-intel-processor-\ncore-i3-i5-i7-2937692) chips. These processors are the most common you’ll find\nin cheaper laptops, as well as ultra-thin and light notebooks.\n\n**Related:[Best CPUs for gaming](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-cpu-for-\ngaming_round-up)**\n\nWhere the last-generation equivalents of these new processors were dual-core\nparts, Intel has doubled the number of cores. Quad-core performance on an\nUltrabook? Result! Well, not quite.\n\nYes, there will be four cores but there’s more to performance than just number\nof cores. These are still low-power processors. In other words, these aren’t\nintended to replace more powerful quad-core laptops using ‘H’-series CPUs.\nHowever, what is clear is that new laptops will be much better at handling\nmultiple tasks at the same time (such as loads of browser tabs), and should\nmake many tasks a lot smoother.\n\nIntel says 80 laptops will be available with the new quad-core chips before\nthe end of the year, although how many come to the UK remains to be seen.\n\n**Related:[New Nvidia MX150 laptop graphics\nexplained](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/nvidia-geforce-\nmx150-performance-benchmarks-laptop-dedicated-graphics-explained-3276870)**\n\nThe IFA 2017 show has kicked off in style, with several laptop makers\nannouncing new laptops and updates to older models that will feature eighth-\ngeneration Intel chips. Here’s a selection of some of the big hitters that’ve\nbeen announced so far.\n\n  * [Dell XPS 13](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/dell-xps-13) from September 12\n  * Asus ZenBook Flip S, Flip 14 and 15 (release TBC)\n  * [Asus ZenBook 3 Deluxe](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/asus-zenbook-3-deluxe)\n  * Asus ZenBook 13 UX331\n  * Acer Swift 5 2017 from December\n  * Acer Spin 5 2017 from September\n  * Acer Switch 7 Black Edition from December\n  * [Lenovo Yoga 920](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/lenovo-yoga-920)\n  * Lenovo Miix 520\n  * _More to come_\n\n##  Intel 8th-gen laptop CPU specs\n\n| **i7-8650U** | **i7-8550U** | **i5-8350U** | **i5-8250U**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n**Processor frequency (GHz)** |  1.9-4.2 | 1.8-4 | 1.7-3.6 | 1.6-3.4  \n**CPU cores/threads** |  4/8 | 4/8 | 4/8 | 4/8  \n**Cache** |  8MB | 8MB | 6MB | 6MB  \n**Graphics clock speed (MHz)** |  Up to 1150 | Up to 1150 | Up to 1000 | Up to\n1000  \n  \nThis first tranche of new chips will be running on a refined version of\nIntel’s previous-generation CPU architecture, called Kaby Lake. While it’s the\nsame underlying technology, this only tells part of the story.\n\nWhile there are more cores, the base clock speed of each chip is substantially\nlower than their predecessors. The Core i7-7600U, for example started at\n2.8GHz, while the new i7-8650U will run as low as 1.9GHz.\n\nThis makes sense, given putting Intel is putting two extra cores on a chip\nthat has the same thermal design power (TDP) as the last generation. There’s\nno such thing as a free lunch in the world of microelectronics and these chips\nwill have to manage their heat somehow.\n\n**Related:[Best AMD and Intel motherboards\ntested](http://trustedreviews.com/guide/best-motherboard)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThis means some cores won’t be running at their potential all of the time, but\nyou should still get a nice combination of sprightly single-core performance\nand multi-task-friendly quad-core experience. This differs from Intel’s other\nquad-core laptop chips from the H-Series (which you’ll find in the Dell XPS 15\nand 15-inch MacBook Pro among others), which run at a much higher base clock\nspeed.\n\nIntel hasn’t detailed how this will work, and has been a little tight-lipped\non some of the more technical specifics. The maths here is a bit interesting\nbecause some might say that doubling the number of cores should straight up\ndouble the performance. As we explain above, this isn’t how things work. But\nwhat’s more interesting is that doubling the number of cores on these new\nchips has actually only granted an extra 25% raw performance, with the final\n15% coming from an improved design and better manufacturing capabilities.\n\nOne final note on these new chips: Intel has re-branded its HD Graphics on-\nboard GPU to UHD Graphics. Don’t be confused, however, as this really is just\na re-brand. There’s no performance difference at all.\n\nThere are more laptop chips we’re still waiting to hear about: H-Series (high-\nend), M-Series (mid-tier quad-core) and Y-Series (ultra-low-power) all remain\na mystery, as does the rest of the U-series range, which normally consists of\na dozen or more chips.\n\n##  Intel’s strategy shift\n\nThe new laptop processors revealed above are based on Intel’s current-\ngeneration Kaby Lake design. We had actually expected Intel to dump Kaby Lake\nentirely for this generation, as the company doesn’t have a habit of extending\nthe life of older technology.\n\nIn fact, 8th-gen will encompass not just Kaby Lake, but also Coffee Lake and\nCannon Lake designs. This is one of those rare occasions where CPU geeks will\nbe more confused than the average consumer; remember that regular consumers\nalmost never see the codenames of the chips that end up in the computers they\nbuy.\n\nAs a reminder, Kaby Lake is an enhanced version of Intel’s 14nm Skylake design\n( known as 14nm+). Coffee Lake is also known as 14nm++. Cannon Lake, is a 10nm\ndesign. Put very simply, a smaller transistor design means more power\nefficiency.\n\n**Related:[Best laptops](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-laptops)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIntel has justified its decision to include a refreshed Kaby Lake architecture\nin its new generation because it believes the performance difference is big\nenough for regular consumers to consider it as such. Desktop chips, meanwhile,\nwill use the upcoming Coffee Lake architecture, while laptops will see Cannon\nLake tech towards the end of the year.\n\n##  Ryzen to the occasion?\n\nMost will see this laptop launch as an early response to AMD’s [Ryzen\nMobile](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/amd-ryzen-mobile-laptops-vega-\nperformance-price-release-date-2949002). Intel’s arch consumer rival has\nalready set the world alight with impressive new desktop processors, and while\nwe know very little about its laptop efforts, Intel clearly believes AMD is\nbringing loads of cores to the table, as it did with its desktop products.\n\nIntel has an enormous amount of clout in the laptop market, and given how many\nlaptop companies seem to have committed to 8th-generation Intel, it’ll be\ninteresting to see how many also launch desirable machines with AMD Ryzen\nprocessors.\n\n**Related:[Samsung Galaxy S9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-\ngalaxy-s9-release-date-specs-features-price-uk-3266552)**\n\n**What’s your take on Coffee Lake?
