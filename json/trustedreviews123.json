Still, the Note 9 looks to be a\ngood upgrade on an already great phone.\n\nBut how does it compare to Samsung’s other big flagship of the year? Let’s\ndelve into the specs and features and see what sets the two devices apart.\n\n**Related:[Samsung Galaxy Note 9 vs iPhone\nX](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-9-vs-\niphone-x-3527113)**\n\n## **Samsung Galaxy Note 9 vs Galaxy S9 design – A very similar design**\n\nSamsung has decided upon a common design theme for its high-end devices, and\nthat can be seen in both the Note 9 and S9. Both handset sport a swathe of\nglass and metal, a sloping display and glass backs. The Note series is a\nlittle more angular and harsh around the edges, while the S series is curvier\nand softer.\n\nThe most obvious difference is size. The [Samsung Galaxy\nS9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9) has a 5.8-inch\nscreen, whereas the Note 9 ups that to 6.4 inches. This is a significant\nincrease that makes for a much bigger overall phone.\n\n![Samsung Galaxy S9\nfront](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Call of Cthulhu](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Call of Cthulhu\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/call-of-cthulhu \"Call of Cthulhu\")\n\n  * [ ![iPad Pro 2018](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: MySmartPrice / @OnLeaks \n\n### New iPad Pro 2018 leak shows Apple is almost certainly dropping the Home\nbutton\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ipad-pro-2018-release-date-specs-\nprice-3482812 \"New iPad Pro 2018 leak shows Apple is almost certainly dropping\nthe Home button\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Pete Lau on stage at the OnePlus 6T launch](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### The OnePlus 6T ditched the headphone jack, CEO Pete Lau tells us why\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ceo-pete-lau-oneplus-6t-headphone-jack-\nwireless-charging-3612475 \"The OnePlus 6T ditched the headphone jack, CEO Pete\nLau tells us why\")\n\n  * \n\nAnother differentiator is the S Pen. This stylus has been a hallmark of the\nNote series and works exceptionally well with the sizeable screen. For the\nNote 9, Samsung adds Bluetooth to the S Pen, so you can control presentations\nfrom across the room and use it to activate the camera.\n\n**Related:[Samsung Galaxy Note 9 vs Note\n8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-9-vs-\nnote-8-3526974)**\n\nBoth phones feature a USB-C port for charging; 3.5mm headphone jack on the\nbottom; and fingerprint sensors below the camera module on the rear of the\ndevice. They also feature iris scanners around the front and facial\nrecognition.\n\nAn [IP68](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/what-is-ip68-ip-ratings-\nexplained-2947135) rating for water-resistance is also common among both\ndevices, meaning they’ll survive a dunk in a meter of water for 30 minutes.\n\n![Samsung Galaxy Note 9 S Pen presentation lifestyle press\nimage](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## **Samsung Galaxy Note 9 vs Galaxy S9 specs – Which is the most powerful?**\n\nThere was a time when the Note 9’s internals would ape those of the S series,\nbut this isn’t the case here.\n\nBoth phones are powered by either an Exynos 9810 or [Snapdragon\n845](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/snapdragon-845-benchmark-phones-\nspeed-3390981) (region depending), which are some of the fastest mobile chips\non the market. The Note 9 does have slightly more RAM – 6GB or 8GB rather than\n4GB – and the storage options run to 512GB.\n\nHaving a more generously sized body means there’s more space for a larger\nbattery. Inside the Note 9 you’ll find a 4000mAh cell; the Galaxy S9 has a\n3000mAh version. Obviously, the larger display will consume far more power, so\nit will be interesting to see how much longer the Note 9 lasts off a single\ncharge. Both devices include fast charging and wireless charging.\n\n**Related:[Best smartphones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nsmartphone-3431175)**\n\n| **Galaxy S9** | **Galaxy Note 9**  \n---|---|---  \n**Screen** |  5.8-inch, quad-HD AMOLED, HDR | 6.4-inch, quad-HD AMOLED, HDR  \n**Performance** |  Snapdragon 845/Exynos 9810 | Snapdragon 845/Exynos 9810  \n**RAM** |  4GB | 6GB/8GB  \n**Storage** |  64GB + microSD | 64GB/256GB + microSD  \n**Rear camera** |  12MP (f/1.7 – f/1.5 – f/2.4), OIS, 4K video, Dual Pixel | 2\nx 12MP (f/1.7 – f/1.5 – f/2.4 – main), OIS, 4K video, Dual Pixel  \n**Front camera** |  8MP, f/1.7 | 8MP, f/1.7  \n**Battery** |  3000mAh, fast charge, wireless charging | 4000mAh, fast charge,\nwireless charging  \n**S-Pen** |  No | Yes (with Bluetooth)  \n  \nThe two handsets also share similarities in the optics department. Like the\nGalaxy S9, the Note ships with a main 12-megapixel camera that can dynamically\nshift aperture depending on the situation.\n\nIf you’re shooting in low light, the camera will switch to an f/1.7 aperture\nand allow more light into the sensor, giving you a brighter shot. At other\ntimes the camera will narrow the aperture to f/2.4. There’s also OIS (optical\nimage stabilisation), 4K video recording and an 8-megapixel front-facing\ncamera.\n\n**Related:[Samsung Galaxy Note 9 vs Galaxy S9\nPlus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-9-vs-\ngalaxy-s9-plus-3525284)**\n\n![Samsung Galaxy Note 9 neck scarf woman drawing cropped press\nimage](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nWhere the Note 9 is slightly different is with the secondary sensor. This\nextra camera allows you to take 2x shoots – essentially allowing you to zoom\nwithout sacrificing picture quality – and improved portraits. There’s no\nsecondary camera on the S9, with that feature available only with the S9 Plus.\n\nAnother new feature for the Note 9 is a software bump to the camera. It can\nnow detect scenes – there’s 20 to choose from – and will tell you if there’s\nsomething visibly wrong with your pictures.\n\n**Related:[Best Android phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nandroid-phones-3438996)**\n\n![Samsung Galaxy\nS9](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nEven though the Note 9 has a significantly larger screen, the resolution is\nidentical to that of the S9. With a 2960 x 1440 resolution, both support HDR\nand use AMOLED tech. The display on the Galaxy S9 is stunning, and we doubt\nthe Note 9 will be anything different.\n\n## **Samsung Galaxy Note 9 vs Galaxy S9 price – What’s the cost?**\n\nNeither phone is cheap, although since the Galaxy S9 is the older device it\ncan picked up for far less than the Note 9’s launch price. The retail price of\nthe Galaxy S9 is £739; however, it’s possible to find it for less if you shop\naround or buy a refurbished model.\n\nThe Note 9 starts at £899, that’s for the 128GB variant, while the 512GB will\nset you back £1099. That’s pricing we’ve only really seen before on the\n[iPhone X](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-x).\n\n![Samsung Galaxy Note 9 woman in cafe lifestyle press\nimage](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Early Verdict\n\nA decision over whether to opt for the Galaxy S9 or Note 9 will really come\ndown to size. Are you looking for a device that’s easy to use in one hand, or\none with a huge screen and pen?\n\nBoth have their strengths and weaknesses, and we’ll need to spend a full\nreview period with the Note 9 to see what it has over its smaller brother.\n\n**Related:[Samsung Galaxy Note 9 vs Galaxy S8\nPlus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-9-vs-\ngalaxy-s8-plus-3526323)**\n\n"}
