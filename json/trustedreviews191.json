The good news is that\nsome new information has emerged, giving us unprecedented insight into what\nMicrosoft might be cooking up behind closed doors.\n\nSpecialist blog Windows Central has published a detailed\n[report](https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-andromeda-foldable-device)\nthat suggests Andromeda is actually a new foldable device “with an emphasis on\npen and digital-ink functionality”. The report notes that this device will run\non Windows 10 and “could be here as soon as next year”.\n\nIt’s technically a tablet device, but sources say it’s “designed to be\npocketable when folded”, bringing it down to the size of a phone. It’s also\ntipped to feature telephony capabilities – like making calls and sending texts\n– so you could technically replace your actual smartphone with it.\n\nBut the report notes: “My sources make it clear, however, that this is not\nsupposed to be a smartphone replacement, but rather a device similar to the\ncancelled ‘Microsoft Courier’. In short, Andromeda is a digital pocket\nnotebook.”\n\nThe writer goes on: “I’m told the device puts pen and inking at the very\nforefront of its experience, with some prototypes opening up into a notebook\napp that’s tied to OneNote,” adding: “The notebook app itself is designed in a\nway that mimics writing in a real notebook, with virtual pages that spread\nacross the foldable device.”\n\nThis Andromeda folding tablet is tipped to become one of the new wave of\nupcoming devices running on Qualcomm’s powerful Snapdragon processors.

However,\nthe company still appears to be all-in on hybrids, and this is arguably just\nanother take on the 2-in-1s we’ve seen rising in popularity amongst consumers.\n\nStill, Microsoft hasn’t announced anything officially, so take all of this\nwith due caution for now.\n\n**Related:[Snapdragon 835\nbenchmarks](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/snapdragon-835-phones-\nprocessor-specs-speed-benchmark-chipset-cores-2944086)**\n\n**What would you like to see from a future Microsoft hybrid?
