Until we’ve had one into test we’ll hold our final\njudgement, but the specs along make it clear AMD means business.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about AMD’s mobile CPUs:\n\n## AMD Ryzen Mobile – Specs and technology\n\nFirst, a brief catchup. AMD turned the world of desktop processors on its head\nwhen it launched its [Ryzen](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/amd-ryzen-\nspecs-performance-release-date-2993147) processors nearly eight months. The\ncompany’s Ryzen 3, 5 and 7 chips took on Intel at its own game and briefly\nheld the crown as the fastest mainstream processors you could buy.\n\n**Related:[Best CPU for gaming](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-cpu-\nfor-gaming)**\n\nThe launch of Ryzen Mobile has been anticipated for some time. The company\nfirst announced what’s codenamed ‘Raven Ridge’ in May 2017. Since then,\nhowever, things have been very quiet.\n\nToday, two new laptop processors were revealed: Ryzen 5 2500U and Ryzen 7\n2700U. The two chips are quad-core models, taking on Intel’s latest quad-core\neighth-generation laptop processors.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nHere’s the full spec alongside its Core i rivals:\n\n| Ryzen 7 2700U | Core i7-8550U | Ryzen 5 2500U | Core i5-8250U  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nCores/Threads | 4/8 | 4/8 | 4/8 | 4/8  \nBase clock speed (GHz) | 2.2 | 1.8 | 2.0 | 1.6  \nMaximum clock speed (GHz) | 3.8 | 4.0 | 3.6 | 3.4  \nGraphics | Radeon Vega 10 | Intel UHD 620 | Radeon Vega 8 | Intel UHD 620  \nRAM support | Up to 2400MHz DDR4 | Up to 2400MHz DDR4, or 2133MHz LPDDR3 | Up\nto 2400MHz DDR4 | Up to 2400MHz DDR4, or 2133MHz LPDDR3  \nMax TDP | 25W | 25W | 25W | 25W  \n  \nYou might have noticed the ‘2’ in front of each of the Ryzen model numbers.\nThat’s because AMD considers these to be second-generation Ryzen CPUs with\nimproved performance and technology inside.\n\nThere are lots of technical tweaks under the hood, including significantly\nimproved Precision Boost 2 technology, which is faster at deciding which of\nthe processor cores should be given more performance at any given moment.\n\nMobile XFR (extended Frequency Range) allows chips to run at a higher clock\nspeed if thermals allow. The version of XFR seen here is able to better\nunderstand the CPU’s thermal conditions and act accordingly.\n\nWhile AMD has made some obvious claims about battery life (it’s more efficient\nthan previous generation ‘Bristol Ridge’), but beyond that it’s more or less\nup to laptop manufacturers to decide how they balance performance and battery.\nOne potential snag is that these Ryzen Mobile chips only support DDR4 memory,\nwhich by all accounts is less power-efficient than LPDDR3, especially when a\nlaptop is in Sleep mode. It’ll be interesting to see how this pans out.\n\n**Related:[Best laptop deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-\nlaptop-deals-3238633)**\n\n## AMD Ryzen Mobile – Performance\n\nAMD is making some fairly large claims about the processing performance and\ngraphics capabilities of its new chips.\n\nIn terms of single-core speed, which is what makes your PC feel snappy when\nopening programs and the like, the CPU is on a par with the equivalent Intel\nchip, albeit slightly slower in the Cinebench single-core benchmark. With all\ncores firing, the Ryzen 7 2700U has a significant advantage over the i7-8550U,\nalthough we’ll need to investigate further in our own controlled conditions to\nsee how other variables affect performance.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nUnsurprisingly, AMD and presumably the laptop manufacturers will be marketing\nthese new chips as video-editing power houses.\n\nAnd there’ll also be potential for gaming. Vega-based graphics chips with 10\nand 8 cores respectively on Ryzen 7 and 5 chips will, apparently, offer around\n2.6x the performance of Intel’s integrated graphics at least one one specific\nbenchmark.\n\nThese processors aren’t going to be AAA gaming powerhouses, but they’ll get\nthe job done in some eSports titles, as AMD’s below graphs claim.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## AMD Ryzen Mobile – Laptops\n\nThree Ryzen laptops have been announced. Two of them aren’t particularly\nspecial and represent the sort of mid-range, chunky laptops that AMD chips\nhave been found inside in the past.\n\nThe third, however, is the Lenovo IdeaPad 720S. This laptop is our top\nUltrabook recommendation with 7th-gen Intel chips on board, so if a Ryzen\nmodel makes it to British shores at the right price, it could be a seriously\ncompetitive piece of kit, especially if the claimed graphics performance is as\ngood as AMD claims.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe HP Envy x360 is the second laptop to be announced with AMD Ryzen on board.\nIt’s a minor refresh of a pre-existing design, and at 2.15kg it certainly\nisn’t an exciting thin and light ultrabook.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe 15.6-inch Acer Swift 3 is another fairly chunky machine that’ll be graced\nby Ryzen.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAMD says the first Ryzen Mobile laptops will be available for the 2017 holiday\nseason, with more launching in 2018.\n\n## Why is this important?\n\nAMD has supplied processors in laptops for years, but it’s only ever been\nsidelined to chunky budget machines that do little to enhance the AMD brand.\nWith Ryzen Mobile, it’s now possible for AMD chips to squeeze into Ultrabook-\nclass laptops and finally rival Intel.\n\nHowever, as ever, it’s not entirely in AMD’s hands. Dell and Asus are missing\nfrom the launch lineup and haven’t publicly committed to a Ryzen Mobile laptop\nmodel. In order for Ryzen Mobile to be a success, AMD will need all of its\npartners to make a significant commitment to the architecture in lots of\nmachines, and sell them in lots of places.\n\nAnd, in order to do that, the public at large needs to understand what Ryzen\nactually is versus Intel’s own offerings. By copying Intel’s 3, 5, 7 naming\nconvention, AMD has made that easier, but getting average shoppers to even\nrecognise the AMD brand will definitely require a big marketing push. Expect\nto see plenty of AMD ads next year.\n\n"}
