Because Sony (and\neveryone else) doesn’t use the same hardware, the company first has to build\nits own hardware abstraction layer (HAL). Once that’s done, the company\ntackles the things that make a phone a phone: ensuring it can make calls,\nsend/receive messages and sustain an internet connection.\n\nAfter that comes what Sony calls the Sony-fication – which means modifying all\nthe custom Sony software that’s on the system. Your feelings about Sony’s own\ncustom Xperia software will dictate your feelings about this particular delay.\n\nAfter that comes internal testing for Sony staff alongside a little external\nexperimentation. The company says by this point it “will be working well for\ndaily use but with functionality missing.”\n\nOnce things are behaving, it’s time for certification and approval. “This\ncrucial period is about ensuring everything meets tech standards like\nBluetooth and WiFi,” Sony explains.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nOnce that’s done, you’d think we’d be ready for launch. You’d be wrong. First,\nthe network operators like EE, Three, O2 and Vodafone need to get their hands\non the software, in case they need custom versions. Then, and only then, will\nthe software start downloading to everyones’ phone.\n\nWhich is why, unless you bought a [Google Pixel\n2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-2) last year, you’ll\nlikely be waiting a few months for [Android\nPie](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/android-pie) yet. In the case of\nSony, the [Sony Xperia XZ2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sony-\nxperia-xz2) and [Sony Xperia XZ1](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sony-\nxperia-xz1) series will get it from November alongside the [Sony Xperia XZ\nPremium](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sony-xperia-xz-premium), but\nXA2 series owners will be waiting until early 2019.\n\n**Related:**[ **Best smartphone**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nsmartphone-3431175)\n\nAlthough reading the infographic in full makes third-party phone\nmanufacturer’s tardy release schedule a bit more understandable, it does\ninadvertently make the case for a purer form of Android without manufacturers’\nlargely unwelcome bells and whistles.\n\nSpeed of updates and guaranteed support (the lack of [Sony Xperia\nXZ](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sony-xperia-xz) and [Sony Xperia\nXA1](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sony-xperia-xa1) in the timetable\nis alarming) makes the case of going Google – or at least [Android\nOne](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/what-is-android-one-2924502) –\nbetter than 100 adverts ever could.\n\n**Is getting a new version of Android quickly important to you?
