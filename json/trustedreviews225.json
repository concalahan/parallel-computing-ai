That’s where David comes\nin.**\n\nIt’s made by a company called Sculptify, and aims to make 3D printing much\nmore affordable. How? It uses pellets instead of traditional strands of\nfilament.\n\nThink of it in terms of cars. If regular 3D printers are like normal cars, and\nfilament is like petrol, then David is like a Tesla, and pellets are like\nelectricity.\n\nNot only are pellets cheaper, Sculptify claims they’re more versatile too.\n“Every plastic product, even filament, starts out in pellet form,” it says on\nthe [Kickstarter page](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sculptify/david-\nthe-next-step-in-3d-printing). “Because of this, raw pellets are readily\navailable in thousands of different materials, colours, and grades.\n\n“By printing directly with plastic pellets, David can print with many more\nmaterials than traditional 3D printers – making him more useful to many more\npeople and industries.”\n\nYou don’t have to buy pellets made by Sculptify either, so you’re not locked\nto one brand. It’ll take any of the same kind, available from any number of 3D\nprinting websites. So it’s up to you where you buy them from.\n\nThe downside is that David itself doesn’t come cheap. It costs $3,195\n(£1,917), though the relatively low price of the pellets should help you save\nin the long run.\n\nIt’s already raised more than a quarter of its $100,000 funding target. You\ncan back it yourself for just $1.\n\n(YouTube)49lK9EdTU8Y(/YouTube)\n\n**Read more:** [Red Bull Racing: 3D printing is the future of\nF1](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/red-bull-racing-3d-printing-is-the-\nfuture-of-f1)\n\n"}
