They’re elongated egg-shaped vessels that stand like monoliths over\nthe landscape and which also make weird noises.\n\n![PowerVision\nPowerEgg](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nWell, when enclosed, the PowerVision PowerEgg looks just like one of those.\nThings get a little more terrifying when it opens up to reveal its propeller\narms and four legs. It goes from _Arrival_ to looking like something from _The\nWar of the Worlds_.\n\n**Related:[Best drones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-drones)**\n\n![PowerVision\nPowerEgg](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIt’s a huge departure from the standard quadcopter designs you may have seen\nfrom practically every other drone maker.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n> \"The chances of anything coming from Mars are a million to one,\" he said.\n[pic.twitter.com/RDbKoltDFZ](https://t.co/RDbKoltDFZ)\n\n>\n\n> — Richard Easton (@chocojetpack) [January 11,\n2018](https://twitter.com/chocojetpack/status/951266267972841472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nOnce you look past its strange design, however, it does actually share many\nfeatures of other drones. It can record up to 4K resolution video and has a\n3-axis gimbal for stabilisation. The camera can stream its video in 720p to\nyour paired smartphone and can transmit up to 5km away.\n\n![PowerVision\nPowerEgg](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThere’s a maximum flight speed of 46km/h and a flight time of around 23\nminutes. Controls take the form of a standard twin-stick remote control or,\nmore interestingly, the Maestro, which is designed to be used one-handed and\nlooks a lot like an old Wii Nunchuk controller. The latter aims to simplify\nflight controls and also supports gestures.\n\nThe PowerEgg is available now for $1288.\n\n![PowerVision\nPowerEgg](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAway from the skies, PowerVision was also showing off the PowerDolphin. This\nappears to be a more streamlined version of the\n[PowerRay](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/powerray-underwater-drone-\nthats-fishermans-friend-3277871) underwater drone I saw back at IFA. It’s\ncapable of 4K video and will let you drag bait too. The PowerDolphin will cost\n$749 when it’s released in April.\n\n**Would you head for the hills if you saw a PowerEgg in the skies?
