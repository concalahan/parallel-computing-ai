{"result": 0, "title": "Is Microsoft planning to sell the Xbox in phone-style contracts?", "description": "![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Microsoft is apparently taking inspiration from phone contracts to give its\nXbox division a shot in the arm.**\n\nWindows Central[ has got word](https://www.windowscentral.com/xbox-all-access)\nfrom a number of sources that the Xbox One and Xbox One X will soon be\navailable on a two-year contract in the US. Dubbed Xbox All Access, the deal\nwould provide users with an Xbox One console, as well as two-year\nsubscriptions to Xbox Live and Game Pass.\n\n**Related:**[ **Best Xbox One\ngames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/xbox-one-games-3435271)\n\nIt will set you back $22 per month (~£17) for an [Xbox One\nS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/xbox-one-s) or $35 per month (~£27)\nfor the 4K-toting [Xbox One X](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/xbox-\none-x).\n\nAt the end of the two years, as with your current phone contract, your debt is\npaid off and you own the console. Unlike a phone, of course, the console will\nlikely still have plenty of legs left, and you won’t be left immediately\nseeking an upgrade.\n\nSo, is that good value? Well, an Xbox One S costs $230 and an [Xbox One X goes\nfor $499](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/xbox-one-x-playerunknowns-\nbattlegrounds-bundle-1tb-xbox-one/8q79ltn7lt4d?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab).\nTwo years of Live is $120 and Game Pass goes for $9.99 each month, so multiply\nthat by 24 for $239.76. All in, that means a total of $579.76 for the One S\nplus extras or $858.76 for the One X.\n\nThe subscription cost, by contrast would be $528 or $840. So yes, that _is_ a\ngood deal, assuming it’s true and the figures are accurate – even if you could\ngo lower with a little shopping around.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThere’s one big caveat, of course: you may not want Xbox Live or Game Pass.\nUnfortunately, Microsoft really does want you to have that (and ideally to\nforget to cancel your subscription in two years’ time).\n\n**Read more:[Xbox One vs Sony\nPS4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/xbox-one-vs-sony-ps4-2899696)**\n\nThis feels like a smart move by Microsoft. If the phone industry has taught us\nanything, it’s that people will go for a top-end model if they can split the\ncost, often paying more in the long haul than they would by buying a handset\noutright.\n\nIf anything’s going to help close the gap with the [PlayStation\n4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/playstation-4), this isn’t a bad\nhorse to back.\n\n**Would you buy an Xbox One via a subscription?
