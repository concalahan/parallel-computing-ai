However,\nhere there’s a sense that it’s not just our hero, the Deputy, who’s escaping\nEden Gate’s cult maniacs, but the series trying to escape its limitations. Far\nCry 5 is running both from the ghosts of Far Crys past and the even more\nterrifying spectre of the ‘Ubigame’ – that cynical internet theory that all\nUbisoft games are essentially the same.\n\nIt’s a theory that won a lot of supporters after Ubisoft released an endless\nstream of near-identical open-world games that followed the same tired format:\nclimb towers, take over territories, repeat.\n\n**Buy Far Cry 5\nfrom[Tesco.com](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7090&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-\ntescocampaign&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tesco.com%2Fdirect%2Ffar-\ncry-5-ps4%2F306-3007.prd%3FskuId%3D306-3007) ****|**[\n**Amazon.com**](http://amzn.to/2oLrziV)\n\n![Far Cry\n5](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nUbisoft’s studios seem to have taken these criticisms to heart. First it made\nsweeping changes with Assassin’s Creed Origins – the freshest game in the\nseries for years – and now Far Cry 5 attempts to similarly move on. And it’s\nmostly successful. Where Far Cry 4 sometimes felt like a next-gen reworking of\nFar Cry 3, Far Cry 5 has its own distinct feel.\n\nThat’s partly down to the setting. Where the previous games explored more\nexotic African, South-East Asian and Himalayan landscapes, this one is a\njourney into the rural North West of America and the heartlands of the militia\n– with a touch of the Bible belt on the side. You’re still gunning down\ngeneric goons by the dozen, but this time they’re crazed doomsday cultists\nfrom a weird pseudo-Christian religion led by four charismatic siblings.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThe key words here are organic and immersive. Out goes the mini-map and all\nthose icons, though you’ll still spot indicators on the compass at the top of\nthe screen. Out, too, goes all that climbing-towers business. You’ll discover\nmissions and activities because you happen to come across them, or because one\ncharacter that you meet will send you in the right direction, not by climbing\nto a higher viewpoint. Comparisons to Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild are\na bit excessive – Far Cry 5 isn’t that radical a departure – but there’s\nsomething of that game’s commitment to unfolding action, where you’re driven\nmore by curiosity than an endless to-do list of stuff.\n\n**Related:[Best PS4 games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nps4-games)**\n\n![Far Cry\n5](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nThere are changes afoot in the wider structure, too. Where the previous two\nFar Cry games have been cat-and-mouse battles against the forces of one major\nantagonist, Far Cry 5 gives us three villains – John, Faith and Jacob Seed –\nspread across three regions of Hope County, with the fourth, Joseph, steadily\ncoming into play.\n\nJoseph Seed might be the game’s central villain, but don’t dismiss his three\nheralds out of hand. They’re not just bosses to be battled, each defines a\nregion and the events and forces you’ll encounter. Each of their homelands has\nits own personality, its own landmarks and its own signature enemies, and your\nfight against each herald runs through several interesting arcs before a\ncathartic final encounter. You’re free to focus in on one or keep switching\nbetween two or three ongoing dramas – the choice is yours – giving Far Cry 5 a\nvariety that the series hasn’t always had before.\n\nAnd beneath all this there’s something interesting going on here. Much has\nbeen made of Far Cry’s move to rugged Montana, but Ubisoft has made it a\nstrange and unsettling mirror of modern America, where ordinary folk become\nheroes and craziness lurks around every corner. For all its gung-ho action,\nsandbox ultraviolence, kooky characters and Rockstar-style satire, Far Cry 5\nis a game with something to say, even if it isn’t always clear quite what that\nis.\n\nPerhaps it’s sometimes too careful about saying it, cautiously balancing its\ndoomsday cultist villains with stout-hearted and patriotic militia who, while\nthey might sound a bit nutty, always have their heart in the right place. But\nwhile the characterisation isn’t always subtle, there’s a roundedness to the\ncast that makes you feel there’s more at stake than simply blowing shit up.\nThis is a more reactive world than Kyrat, where part of your reward for\ntackling the Seeds and their Project at Eden’s Gate followers is watching your\nfellow citizens rise to resist them and ordinary life re-established. Where\nFar Cry 4 was much more morally ambiguous, Far Cry 5 makes you feel like a\nforce for good.\n\n**Related:[Best Xbox One games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nxbox-one-games)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIt’s almost unnecessary to say that this is a beautiful and intricately\ndetailed open world, with its own busy ecosystems and vibrant characters, but\nwe’re going to say it anyway: it’s an incredible place to explore. Play Far\nCry 5 on the [Xbox One X](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/xbox-one-x),\nand the stunning mountain scenery, lush vegetation and atmospheric volumetric\nlighting create some truly breathtaking vistas, not to mention some\nimpressively spectacular firefights when all hell breaks loose.\n\nUnderneath all this, however, there’s still a sense that the deviations from\nthe Far Cry template only go so far. Some of the mission design is excellent,\nparticularly when there’s a key set-piece to be played out, but there are\nstill a lot of repetitive activities that need to be completed before you can\ndraw Joseph or his heralds to make their next move. You’ll still spend a lot\nof time assaulting and taking over cult outposts, attacking cult convoys,\ndestroying roadblocks and silos or rescuing innocent citizens from cult\nabductions. The flow of the action is more organic – you might have an idea\nwhere you’re going, but you inevitably get side-tracked – but a lot of your\nminute-to-minute activities will still be familiar from past games.\n\nOn the plus side, the action has never been as open to different approaches,\nor as strong. Stealth now works as an option and is actually the best route\nthrough some missions, where charging into battle gets you killed. And while\nit takes time to get used to Far Cry’s aiming, which lacks the fluid motion\nand snap of a CoD or Destiny 2, everything else – a varied arsenal, the\nlimited ammo, the smart, unpredictable AI – makes this the most satisfying Far\nCry in terms of combat yet.\n\nFar Cry’s handling of allies has evolved nicely, with Ubisoft bringing in the\nspecialists and animal companions from Far Cry: Primal. Ordinary citizens can\nbe recruited as footsoldier allies and earn new abilities as they level up.\nCompleting specific story missions will also unlock specialist warriors, some\nproviding sniper support with bows or rifles, others air support through\nstrafing runs and bombs. Best of all, you’ll unlock ‘fangs for hire’, with\ncritters like the dog Boomer, who’ll sniff out enemies and attack them, or the\ncougar, Peaches, who has a nice line in silent stealth attacks. Each\nspecialist gives you new tactical options and can revive you if you’re downed\n– and it’s worth your while doing the same for them.\n\n**Related:[Best PC games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-pc-\ngames)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThere’s also a lot of fun to be had with vehicles, with the usual jeeps and\nATVs joined by muscle cars, machine-gun toting juggernauts, weaponised\ntractors and a whole lot more. There are some brilliant stunt-racing\nchallenges squirreled away as well, and Far Cry 5 still finds time for the\ngrapple, parachute and wingsuit, so all those helicopters and radio towers\nwon’t go to waste.  \nBy any standards, this is a fantastic sandbox shooter – the most engaging and\nabsorbing in an always stellar series. Yet it’s no coincidence that it’s at\nits best when the Seeds themselves enter the fray. Where Joseph is an\nunsettling, quietly enigmatic presence for much of the game, his three heralds\npunctuate the action with regular shots of pure craziness, and it’s here where\nFar Cry 5 cuts loose with its most disruptive, subversive passages.\n\nWhere John pushes you through increasingly gruesome confrontations, Jacob hits\nyou with surreal, brainwashing training challenges and Faith tempts you away\nfrom your hero’s journey with soft talk that leads you into madness. While\nsome scenes of violence and torture grow excessive – I sometimes wondered how\nmuch brutality as entertainment I could stomach – these sequences do a\nfantastic job of focusing the action and driving you forwards. In fact, you\ncould argue that they do it too well.\n\n**Related:**[ **How Ubisoft built the Project at Eden’s\nGate**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/cult-ure-club-ubisoft-built-\nproject-edens-gate-3407849)\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nMaybe it’s impossible to maintain that level of nerve-wracked, strung-out\nintensity over so many hours of freeform gameplay in such a vast open world,\nbut the return to normal busywork missions can feel deflating. What’s more,\nhow many times can one guy get hunted, caught and rescued? Yet, overall, Far\nCry 5 finds a balance between its more compelling narrative and its all-action\nsmorgasbord structure. At every point where you start to grow weary of the\nmundane, something comes along and knocks you off your feet. That’s important,\nbecause this is a massive game. Expect a good thirty to forty hours of action\nbefore you see the credits roll.\n\nIt is, of course, both playable and hugely enjoyable in co-op, but Far Cry 5\nthrows in something new to keep you coming back once that happens: Far Cry\nArcade. An evolution of the old Map Editor, it enables you to build your own\nsolo, co-op and multiplayer missions, or at least play through those that\nothers – including Ubisoft – have built. The editor itself is fairly complex\nand will take a while to master, but some of the ready-made maps are fun, with\nsome interesting puzzle-style challenges. These arguably suit Far Cry’s style\nbetter than the PvP Arcade mode, though this might grow stronger should the\nmaps grow more inventive and the player count rise.\n\n**Buy Now:[Far Cry 5 at Tesco.com for\n£48](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7090&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-\ntescocampaign&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tesco.com%2Fdirect%2Ffar-\ncry-5-ps4%2F306-3007.prd%3FskuId%3D306-3007)**\n\n![Far Cry\n5](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\n## Verdict\n\nDoes Far Cry 5 escape the Ubigame shadow? At its best, it does tear itself\nfree, with some systems stripped away and others streamlined, plus a greater\nsense of immersion and discovery than the series has had in years. The Seeds\nmake great Far Cry villains, disrupting the flow when it threatens to grow\ndull, and there’s something familiar and unsettling about the Montana setting\nthat brings the whole game to life.\n\nYet there’s still a sense that Far Cry needs to push things further, with too\nmany mundane and repetitive tasks littering its map screen, and that more\nvariety is needed in its core mission design. This is a phenomenal open-world\nshooter and an excellent Far Cry. With a little extra push, it could have been\neven more.\n\n## Score\n\n  \n\n"}
