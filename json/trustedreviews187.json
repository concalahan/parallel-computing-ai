They offer the same 64GB and 256GB storageconfigurations, although the XR also comes in a 512GB configuration; both runiOS 12 (with the iPhone X getting an upgrade from iOS 11); both pack in7-megapixel front-facing cameras; and both support HDR10 and Dolby Vision.| **iPhone X** | **iPhone XR**  ---|---|---  **Display** |  5.8-inch 1124 x 2436 AMOLED | 6.1-inch 1792 x 828 IPS LCD  **Processor** |  Apple A11 Bionic | Apple A12 Bionic  **Rear camera** |  Dual 12-megapixels | Single 12-megapixels  **Front camera** |  7-megapixels | 7-megapixels  **Software** |  iOS 12 (upgraded from iOS 11) | iOS 12  **Storage** |  64/256GB | 64/256/512GB    Apple’s A11 Bionic chip is still proving to be a formidable piece of siliconin benchmarking tests. It continues to render the iPhone X an unquestionablyresponsive handset, delivering a flagship-class experience whether you’rebrowsing social media, gaming or enjoying an augmented-reality experience. TheXR’s newer A12 Bionic chip simply takes things up a notch and should top theiPhone X in every benchmark and real-world performance test you can throw atit.## iPhone XR vs iPhone X – CameraThe biggest visible difference, aside from size, may well be what lies on theback of both of these robust smartphones. The iPhone X’s dual 12-megapixelcamera array sat atop the pile with regards to features and quality whencompared to what its launch siblings, the [iPhone8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-8) and [iPhone 8Plus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-8-plus), had to offer.The main advantage of that dual setup is lossless optical zoom, which thesingle sensor on the XR lacks. Despite its monocular configuration though it’sthe first iPhone that retains the company’s portrait mode (which throws subtlebackground blur or virtual lighting effects into the mix) technology on therear camera too.## iPhone XR vs iPhone X – PriceUnless you were living under a rock from September to November time last year,you would have heard about the £1000/$1000 iPhone. Due to the technicaladvancements that Apple brought about with the iPhone X, the company decidedthat its new top handset justified a bump up to the ceiling of iPhone startingprices. At £999/$999 for the base 64GB model, the iPhone X wasunapologetically pricey.The newer iPhone XR, meanwhile, is a slightly different proposition. It’sstill far from an affordable handset at £749/$749, but provided you’re okaymissing out on the X’s superior screen and dual camera, you can pick up a morepowerful smartphone with greater future-proofing for a touch less.### Best iPhone XR Deals[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=tr-iphonexr&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xr-64gb-black%3Ftariffcode%3DDD1ZMFEB18)[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=tr-iphonexr&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xr-64gb-black%3Ftariffcode%3DDD1ZMFEB18)###[Apple iPhone XR 64GB Black – 4GB of data on Vodafone (use code TRUSTED10)](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=tr-iphonexr&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xr-64gb-black%3Ftariffcode%3DDD1ZMFEB18)If you don't mind paying an upfront cost and only need a moderate amount ofdata a month, this contract gets you a low monthly cost.
