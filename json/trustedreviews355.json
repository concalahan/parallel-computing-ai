One week! Hasn’t that just flown\nby?\n\nBut as Lenny Kravitz once sang, it ain’t over ‘til it’s over, and we’ve still\ngot one final set of challenges for those looking to boost their\nDrift/Ragnarok XP count, unlock The Enforcer, or grab the final loading\nscreen.\n\nSo for the last time this season, let’s get into the challenges.\n\n## Fortnite Season 5 Week 10 – Free Challenges\n\n**Search Jigsaw Puzzle Pieces in Basements 0/7**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe image above has seven of the easiest to find basements. If you’re still a\nbit stuck, below is a breakdown of what specifically you’re looking for.\n\n**Snobby Shores**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThis one’s in the basement of the first house from the bottom. Mine down\nthrough the floor or smash the bookcase at the back of the room to reveal the\nway down.\n\n**South of Snobby**\n\nLook for the double-doors on ground level. Smash these doors and follow the\nstairs down.\n\n**West of Risky Reels**\n\nThere’s a set of houses just west of Risky. Head there and break the double-\ndoors on the outside of the house leading to the basement to gain access to\nthis piece.\n\n**Greasy Grove**\n\nLand near the upper restaurant, enter it and follow the stairs leading down\ninto the basement. Easy.\n\n**Related:[Super Smash Bros\nUltimate](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/smash-bros-ultimate-release-\ndate-news-gameplay-2949964)**\n\n**Salty Springs**\n\nOn the west side is a house with a brown roof. Head inside, then downstairs\ninto the, you guessed it, basement.\n\n**Shifty Shafts**\n\nNorthwest of Shifty is a building. Head downstairs, into the green screen room\nand you’ll find the jigsaw.\n\n**Pleasant Park**\n\nYou’ll find this piece in the first house on the left. We’ll let you guess\nwhich area of the house it’s in. Here’s a clue: It rhymes with ‘basement’.\n\n**Consume Apples or Mushrooms 0/20**\n\nDespite the large quantity, this one should be easy enough. Dusty Depot used\nto be a great spot for mushrooms, but it isn’t what it used to be. Instead,\nlook for woodland areas in between the named areas. To the West of Tilted\nTowers should be fairly safe. Otherwise, if you’re down with throwing hands,\nWailing Woods has enough mushrooms to make a fine, fine soup.\n\n**Eliminate Opponents (HARD) 0/10**\n\nKill 10 jobbers. You don’t have to emote after you kill them, but that\ndefinitely helps give you a psychological edge. And it’ll annoy their\nteammates, which is a bonus.\n\nHonestly, don’t overthink this one. Just play the game, while focusing on the\nother challenges, and this should pop naturally.\n\nOr play The Getaway and camp escape vans, then when a team starts building up\nhigh, shoot the structures out from under them. It’s cheap, but who really\ncares? We want kills!\n\n**Related:[Upcoming PS4 Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/upcoming-\nps4-games-3530401)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Fortnite Season 5 Week 10 – Battle Pass Challenges\n\n**Search Chests in Salty Springs (HARD) 0/7**\n\n‘Hard’ is an understatement here.\n\nThe blue house is a chest gold mine. There’s the roof, and there’s the\nbasement, and there’s a secret spot under the stairs in the basement. You’re\nlooking at an average of up to four chests per run. The downside, of course,\nbeing everyone else knows this and you’ll have a massive scrap on your hands\nas other players all fight for the same prize. If it’s too hot, focus on\nmining through the roofs of other houses. That’ll be longer, but much safer.\n\n**Deal Damage to Opponents 0/5000**\n\nMuch like with the kill 10 suckers challenge, this will happen naturally\nthrough play. 50v50 is good for mass damage, especially with a rocket\nlauncher. Otherwise just enjoy the game.\n\n[**Search Between a Covered Bridge, Waterfall, and the 9th Green (HARD)\n0/1**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/fortnite-treasure-map-guide-\nseason-5-week-10-3579295)\n\nCheck out the link above for a complete breakdown of where you should be\nheading.\n\n**Stage 1: Eliminate an Opponent in Pleasant Park (HARD) 0/1**\n\n**Stage 2 Eliminate an Opponents in Wailing Woods (HARD) 0/1**\n\n**Stage 3: Eliminate an Opponent in Lucky Landing (HARD) 0/1**\n\nAnd this week’s tiered challenge is… Kills. Plenty of folk go Pleasant, so aim\nto land on the roof, loot up, then pick off players as they run around the\nmiddle, open area.\n\nFor Wailing, most will land in the maze. If you can land first and grab a gun,\nkilling them should be like shooting fish in a hedge.\n\nLucky isn’t the most populated of named areas, so it’d be a good idea to get\nthis one out the way sooner rather than later. There’s a chest under the tree\nin the square garden area. Several more in the buildings at the back. The best\nbet? Keep an eye out for the small buildings slightly to the East. You can\ngrab loot here (mostly) unchallenged and you’ll have the high ground, meaning\npicking off the people who head to the previously-mentioned places should be\ncake.\n\nIf you happened to miss [the week 9\nchallenges](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/fortnite-\nseason-5-week-9-challenges-3552469), which saw players [follow the treasure\nmap found in Shift Shafts](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/fortnite-\ntreasure-map-shifty-shafts-3556538), you’ve still got a week to finish them\nbefore the end of the season.
