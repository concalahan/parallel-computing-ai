SEGA has had the iconic beat-em-up franchise on\nice for over two decades, excluding arcade ports to an endless number of\nsystems.\n\nBut now, a true successor is on the way from Lizardcube and Guard Crush Games.\nResponsible for the excellent Wonderboy: The Dragon Trap and Streets of Fury,\nthere’s a pedigree behind this sequel that bodes well for something quite\nworthwhile.\n\nWhile in the early stages of development, I recently sat down with some of the\nteam behind Streets of Rage 4 and played through a couple of stages. Despite\nboasting a few placeholder assets and missing animations; I had an absolute\nblast.\n\n**Related:**[ **Best PS4 Games**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nps4-games-3431751)\n\n![Streets of Rage\n4](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nIf you played any of the original trilogy, the moment-to-moment action in\nStreets of Rage 4 is immediately familiar. Playing as either Axel Stone or\nBlaze Fielding, within seconds you’re walking through filthy streets and\nhurling your fists into fools. Strikes land with a satisfying impact as\nenemies remain in place before flying across the stage upon the execution of a\ncombo.\n\nYou can also juggle enemies now, surfacing as the team showcased how long they\ncould keep a gaggle of thugs levitating in the air like punchmagicians. I\nwasn’t nearly as impressive, but even I, a punch apprentice, managed to hurl a\nfew beefier enemies into the air with no issues. It’s a small addition, but\nfleshes out a formula that appears to remain largely faithful to the original\nseries.\n\nHeat Moves are another new mechanic jumping into the brawl, lending each\ncharacter a visually stunning special attack activated with a simple tap of\nthe Y button. Axel releases an arching fist of fury, covering foes in flames\nand taking away health overtime. Blaze, on the other hand, unleashes something\na akin to a Hadouken from Street Fighter.\n\nThey’re awesome to use, although feel like they’re charged up far too\nfrequently to feel special. I’d rather see light and heavy attacks for\nchaining together combos with special moves assigned their own individual\ncommand. At this early stage, it lacks a deep satisfaction that similar, more\nmodern brawlers possess.\n\n**Related:**[ **Best Xbox One\nGames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/xbox-one-games-3435271)\n\n![Streets of Rage\n4](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nThere is a little bit of variety in combat at the moment, with supers usable\nboth on the ground and in the air, although the timing window on the latter\nstill needs a bit of work. I was warned that much of the music and sound\neffects were placeholder assets not representative of the finished product.\n\nThe soundtrack is yet to be properly composed, with many fans worried that\nindustry legend Yuzo Koshiro won’t return for the fourth entry. I was told\nthat the developers would be announcing more on this in the future, keen to\nstress that the studio is still busy prototyping new features that will expand\nupon the formula of clobbering bad guys and moving purposefully to the right.\n\nOne frustration with the entire genre is the way in which enemies will\ndisappear off screen if punched into a corner. Having damage dealt by a threat\nyou can’t even see is an obvious annoyance, and Streets of Rage 4 remedies\nthis completely. As a result, it can be a little too easy stun-locking enemies\ninto oblivion once caught in a corner, as they can no longer be knocked off\nscreen at all.\n\nTaking what I assume is a cue from Bloodborne, the game emphasises aggression\nby allowing you to regain lost health with the use of a secondary gauge below\nyour health bar. This faint green gauge rewards you for laying the smackdown\non foes before they have a chance to deal further damage will result in you\nearning back lost life energy. It’s a cool idea, and could really shine once\ncombat is expanded.\n\nWeapons, wider environments and a more concrete narrative are all intended to\nfeature in Streets of Rage 4, but the brief build I played through as both\ncharacters showcased no such inclusions. That being said, the foundations on\ndisplay here are an infectious joy, teasing a beat-em-up I’m very keen to see\ncompleted.\n\n## First Impressions\n\nSince it’s such early days, it’s hard to put my finger on how Streets of Rage\n4 will end up. Lizardcube and Guard Crush Games have an astounding legacy to\nlive up to, and they told me their determined to honour it while putting their\nown spin on things.\n\nThis isn’t a remake, it’s a sequel, and they plan to make that perfectly clear\nwith much more than a fresh coat of paint, regardless of how supremely\ngorgeous it happens to be.\n\n"}
