The ads, which will also promote the use of WhatsApp as a\ncustomer service tool, promise to be quite the money-spinner for the Facebook\nowned app.\n\nThe report says WhatsApp will charge companies between $0.005 and $0.09 per\npotential customer reached. Considering WhatsApp is offering access to more\nthan 1 billion active daily users, that’s could add up quickly.\n\nAround 450 million users are already using the Status page, which is a little\nlike Instagram Stories in that it allows ephemeral photos, text and links that\ndisappear after 24 hours. That compares to the 400 million people using\nInstagram Stories, which already show users advertisements.\n\n**Related:[WhatsApp four-person video calls now\navailable](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/whatsapp-group-video-\ncalls-3520658)**\n\nThe move to charge businesses for access to WhatsApp users comes as the\ncompany seeks out a revenue stream. Previously, the app had dropped a $0.99\nannual subscription fee following the Facebook buyout in 2016.\n\nFacebook paid $22 billion for WhatsApp, so it’s understandable the company\nwould start to seek some return on that investment at some point. Especially\nwhen Facebook itself lost six-times that amount on a single-day’s trading back\nin July.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nWhile it’s just speculation on our part, it’s possible that users will\neventually be able to choose between that subscription fee and seeing\nadvertisements within the Status page.\n\n**Would you rather put up with ads or pay a buck a year to get rid of them?\nShare your thoughts with us @TrustedReviews on Twitter.**\n\n"}
