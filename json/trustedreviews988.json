It reached engineering\nvalidation by 2017, and in 2018, is now mass-production ready.\n\nUsing a 7nm process grants the 980 a significant bump in performance over its\npredecessor across the board. There are now some 6.9 billion transistors on\nthe chip (that’s a 1.6 times increase according to Huawei) and it’s up to 20%\nfaster while requiring 40% less power. Collectively, this grants the Kirin 980\na 75% performance improvement and 58% greater power efficiency overall\n(factoring in its GPU improvements too) compared to the 970.\n\n![Huawei Kirin 980 processor in\nhand](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nIt uses a new triple cluster design with its eight cores divided into three\ngroups. Rather than leveraging a more conventional bigLITTLE architecture, the\n980 boasts two big A76 cores (clocked at 2.6GHz), two ‘middle’ A76 cores (with\na 1.92GHz clock speed) and four little Cortex A55 cores (1.8GHz). This more\nnuanced approach allows the 980 to more efficiently scale performance based on\nbetter AI load prediction; a basic task like music playback will only make use\nof the small cores, social media usage, such as Instagram, may call in the\nhelp of the middle cores, while intensive tasks like gaming will draw on the\nbig cores as needed.\n\nSpeaking of gaming, this is also the first chip to sport a Mali-G76 GPU which\npromises to deliver a 46% improvement in performance and up power efficiency\nby a whopping 178% when compared gaming using the Mali-G72 MP12 featured on\nthe 970.\n\nContinuing on from the AI efforts spear-headed by last year’s chip the 980 is\nthe first SoC to pack in a dual NPU (neural processing unit) or “dual brain”,\nwhich in Huawei’s lab tests outpaced Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 845 in image\nrecognition tasks, handling 4500 images per minute compared to the 845’s rate\nof 2378 in the same time frame.\n\nIt’s not just the AI chip that Huawei has doubled-down on; the 980 also\nutilises the company’s new fourth-generation dual ISP (image signal processor)\nwhich promises to deliver 46% faster camera processing, 23% greater recording\npower efficiency and a 33% improvement in recording efficiency.\n\n![Huawei Kirin 980 processor on display stand\ncloseup](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nYou can also expect more accurate positioning thanks to dual-frequency GPS\nthat leverages the L5 band as well as the L1 band as used by the Kirin 970.\nThe collective effect is a promised ten-fold improvement in location accuracy,\nso your Uber will have no excuse parking on the opposite side of the street to\nyou.\n\nIf raw speed is more your bag, then the Kirin 980 also has something for you.\nIt’s the world’s first chipset to integrate both a Cat.21 LTE 1.4Gbps modem\nand blazingly snappy 2133MHz LPDDR4X RAM. Huawei was also quick to point out\nthat it trumps the Snapdragon 845 with 10 times greater video streaming\nperformance whilst on 4G when moving at speed (their test used a high-speed\ntrain). It doles out greater bandwidth than the 845 and Huawei’s own Hi1103\nWiFi chip supports a throughput of 1732Mbps, almost double that of what the\nSnapdragon can muster.\n\nIt’s as if Huawei designed the Kirin 980 specifically to trounce Qualcomm’s\ncurrent top mobile chip in every area, which isn’t all that surprising but\ndoes beg the question, what will the Snapdragon 850 be able to do in response?\n\n**Related:[Everything you need to know about the Snapdragon\n850](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/snapdragon-850-features-release-\ndate-3481434)**\n\n## Kirin 980: New hardware and release date\n\nHonor might have teased its Kirin 980-toting [Honor Magic\n2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/honor-magic-2-specs-3544349) ahead of\nthe Huawei Mate 20 and Mate 20 Pro’s formal launch but now that the latter\ndevices are officially announced, it looks like Huawei was still able to get\nits chip to market in a phone under its own branding ahead of its upstart\nsibling’s competing 2018 flagship.\n\n**Is the Kirin 980 appealing enough to tempt you to buy a phone that uses it?\nLet us know @TrustedReviews.**\n\n"}
