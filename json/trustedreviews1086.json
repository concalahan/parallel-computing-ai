That means it can be\nhard to spot a bargain. Luckily, then, we’ve always got our eagle eyes on the\nbig retailer. That’s even truer during Amazon Black Friday, when there are\nmore deals than you can shake a stick at.\n\nFor more of our Black Friday coverage, be sure to check out our **[Black\nFriday deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-black-\nfriday-2018-deals-2952384)** guide that includes deals from all of the other\nbig UK retailers.\n\n## When is Amazon Black Friday?\n\nAmazon has now announced that its Amazon Black Friday sales period will last\nfrom **00:00** **Friday November 16th to 23:59 Sunday November 25th**. That\nmeans it all kicks off a week ahead of Black Friday itself, which falls on\nNovember 23rd. Amazon is billing this year’s Amazon Black Friday as ‘ten days\nof deals’, which means there’s a lot to get excited for.\n\n## What to expect from Black Friday Amazon UK\n\nNow that Amazon has announced the official dates for Amazon Black Friday, it\nhas also revealed some details on what to expect, namely: “thousands of deals\non the latest consumer electronics and Amazon devices as well as this year’s\nmust-have toys, games, fashion, jewellery, beauty, home items and more.”\n\nIt’s impossible to predict with absolute certainty what kind of deals Amazon\nwill be running this coming Black Friday. But we can take an educated guess\nbased on previous years, as the retailer is pretty consistent with its\napproach.\n\nWith that in mind, we’d expect to see discounts on **PS4 Pro** and **Nintendo\nSwitch** games consoles, **GoPro** action cameras, and **Ultimate Ears**\nspeakers (eyes peeled for some top **UE Boom 2** deals now that the UE Boom 3\nis out).\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n**Related:[Black Friday Amazon\nEcho](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-echo-deals-2018-3390222)**\n\nNaturally, Amazon will be using Black Friday to push its own hardware. It’s\ntraditionally one of the best times of the year to shop for **Kindles** ,\n**Fire TVs** , **Fire Tablets** and **Echo devices**. We’re expecting massive\nsavings here, as Amazon aggressively seeks to place its Alexa digital\nassistant into every home it can.\n\nLast year, the **Echo Dot** in particular was one of the biggest sellers from\nAmazon UK. Chances are, that 3rd generation model will be discounted. Other\ntop sellers last year included **Call of Duty WWII** , **Oral B electric\ntoothbrushes** , and toys. Lots and lots of toys. Supposedly, Amazon sold 4.3\nmillion of them, so if you’re looking for Christmas presents, it could pay to\nwait for Amazon Black Friday and get all your gifts sorted in one fell swoop.\nAmazon UK also sold 210,000 pairs of headphones.\n\nOne word of advice: if you’re not a fully paid up Amazon Prime member, now is\nthe time to consider signing up for the company’s free 30 day trial. It’ll\ngive you access to a whole load of extra deals, as well as benefits such as\nfree next day deliveries.\n\n* * *\n\n**Free:** [Sign up for a 30-day Amazon Prime\ntrial](http://www.amazon.co.uk/tryprimefree?tag=trusrevi01-21)\n\n* * *\n\n### Amazon Prime Wardrobe\n\n![Amazon Prime\nWardrobe](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAhead of Amazon Black Friday, Amazon has recently announced another new perk\nfor its Prime subscribers, aimed at those who buy fashion from the retail\ngiant. With its [Prime Wardrobe](https://amzn.to/2OXSvw2) benefit, you can now\npick between three to eight items of eligible clothing items to ‘try before\nyou buy’.\n\nThese are then sent to you free of charge, with no upfront cost, where you\nthen have seven days to try them out. A pre-paid bag makes it easy to return\nthe items you don’t want, and you’ll then only be charged for the items you\nwant to keep. It’s an innovative approach, with many shoppers already making\nuse of cheap and easy returns to try out fashion from online retailers. The\nbig change here is not having to pay anything upfront and then worry about\ngetting a refund.\n\n“Whether you want to try out some new wardrobe staples, the latest seasonal\ntrends, or need new clothes for the family with the option to try multiple\nsizes, colours, and styles – Prime Wardrobe makes shopping at Amazon easier\nthan ever” said Susan Saideman, Vice President of Amazon Fashion Europe.\n\nTo celebrate the launch, Amazon has a promotion where you can save £5 if you\nchoose to keep Prime Wardrobe items between £100 to £199.99. If you keep £200\nor more of Prime Wardrobe items, you’ll save £20.

It all started off with expedited delivery but has now expanded to\nmuch, much more.\n\n* * *\n\n**Free:** [Sign up for a 30-day Amazon Prime\ntrial](http://www.amazon.co.uk/tryprimefree?tag=trusrevi01-21)\n\n* * *\n\n### Expedited delivery\n\nQuick delivery is still very welcome, mind you. You can get unlimited one-day\ndelivery across millions of items, and in certain areas you can even get same\nday delivery and 1 or 2-hour delivery through Prime, for absolutely nothing.\n\nIf you order a lot and are in a hurry, this alone can make Prime membership\nworthwhile. We’ve lost count the number of times we’ve had to rely on speedy\ndelivery to get us out of a bind.\n\n### Prime Video\n\nThen there’s Prime Video, which features streaming movies, like Paddington 2,\nand TV shows including plenty of Amazon Originals exclusives like The Tick,\nThe Man in the High Castle and of course The Grand Tour. There’s something for\neveryone.\n\n### Prime Reading\n\nIf you’re more of a reader than a watcher, there’s Prime Reading that gives\nyou access to a rotating catalogue of eBooks, comics and magazines as part of\nyour membership. You also get advanced access to editors’ picks each month.\nThese are free books available early.\n\n### Prime Music\n\nFor music fans, there’s Amazon Prime Music, which has a catalogue of 2 million\nsongs ad-free. This isn’t to be confused with Amazon Prime Music Unlimited,\nhowever, as this is a separate subscription service with 40 million songs.\nThere’s a [4 months for £0.99\npromotion](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/dmusic/promotions/AmazonMusicUnlimited?tag=trusrevi01-21)\nif you fancy trying that out.\n\n### Twitch Prime\n\nTwitch Prime gets you in-game loot every month and ad-free Twitch streaming on\nthe popular gaming service.\n\n### Prime Early Access\n\nYou also get early access to Lightning Deals as a Prime member, giving you an\nall-important head start against other bargain hunters. Amazon Family gets you\n20% off grocery essentials like nappies and baby food, so great value if\nyou’re a new parent.\n\n### Unlimited photo storage\n\nYou also get unlimited free photo storage as part of your membership.\nFantastic news if you’re running out of storage space on your phone or\ncomputer, and a great way to back up those all-important memories.\n\n### Prime exclusive Audible trial\n\nIf you’re a Prime member, you can also take out a [free 90-day Audible\ntrial](https://amzn.to/2KBLs9P). Audible is all about audio books and as part\nof your membership you get credit for one free audiobook every month. You also\nhave access to free audio shows and unlimited listening to original, short\naudio programmes.\n\nYou also get 60% off selected audiobooks. Every audiobook you buy is yours to\nkeep even if you stop your membership. You’re able to listen on a range of\ndevices including mobile and desktop apps, and through your Kindle Fire,\nAmazon Echo or Fire TV.\n\nMembership costs £7.99 a month once the [90-day\ntrial](https://amzn.to/2KBLs9P) is over.\n\n### Amazon Household\n\nYou can also share your Amazon Prime account with a second adult as part of an\nAmazon Household. We don’t mean just giving your other half your Amazon\naccount password either. They can have their own Amazon account but you share\nthe benefits of your Amazon Prime account, including digital content and\nexpedited delivery.\n\nIf you want to set up an Amazon Household, have a read of our\n[guide](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/how-to-share-your-amazon-prime-\nbenefits-for-prime-day-3500628).\n\n### Premier League and other sports (in the future)\n\nAmazon announced it has acquired the [rights to broadcast certain Premier\nLeague football games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/amazon-prime-\npremier-league-3482636) in 2019 exclusively for Prime Members. Expect Amazon\nto bolster its offerings even more in the future to add even more reasons to\nsign up to Prime.\n\n### Amazon Prime Student\n\nIf you’re fortunate to still be living the student life, you also get a host\nof Amazon Prime benefits with Prime Student. Not only do you get 50% off the\ncost of a Prime membership, you get extra discounts like 10% off textbooks,\nfashion and other sections of Amazon. You can see all of the Amazon Prime\nStudent benefits and take out a [free 6-month trial\nhere](https://amzn.to/2JixIeE).\n\n* * *\n\n## Amazon Black Friday – How to know if it’s a good deal\n\n![Amazon Prime Day\nKeepa](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nUse a Chrome extension like\n[Keepa](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keepa-amazon-price-\ntracke/neebplgakaahbhdphmkckjjcegoiijjo?hl=en) or, if you’re not a Chrome\nuser, a site like [CamelCamelCamel](https://uk.camelcamelcamel.com/). Both of\nthese are Amazon price trackers that let you see the Amazon price history on\nproducts. That’s great if you want to see if a price has genuinely dropped and\nif you’re getting a genuinely good deal.\n\nOf the two, Keepa is our favourite as you don’t even have to navigate away\nfrom the Amazon Product page. It’s embedded right there for you as you browse\naround Amazon, instantly letting you see if you’re getting a product for a low\nprice. As prices tend to fluctuate, you’ll have to make a judgement call if\nnow is the right time to snap one up.\n\nIf it’s not the lowest price it’s ever been, but it’s not been discounted for\na long time, it could still be a good time to jump in. You might also actually\nneed a product right now, so that will also help with the decision. It can be\neasy to dilly-dally on a decision, but at the end of the day, it’s a personal\ndecision when to dive in.\n\n### Amazon Warehouse Deals\n\nDon’t forget about [Amazon Warehouse](https://amzn.to/2sE9fdt) deals, which\noffer discounts on used or open box items. Here, Amazon “test the functional\nand physical condition of each item and give the product a specific grade\nbefore selling it.” Amazon’s satisfaction guarantee still applies, so you\ndon’t lose any of the protections you usually get through regular Amazon\npurchases.\n\nAll of this can make it difficult to spot all of the best deals – or at least\nthose that might appeal to you. That’s why we’ve created this page to keep you\nupdated with some of the best deals broken down by different product\ncategories.\n\n### _Want more Trusted Reviews deals?_\n\n**How about these:**\n\n  * [Black Friday 2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-black-friday-2018-deals-2952384)\n  * [Argos Black Friday](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/argos-deals-black-friday-2993228)\n  * [John Lewis Black Friday](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/john-lewis-deals-black-friday-2940065)\n  * [eBay Black Friday](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/ebay-discount-code-black-friday-2942632)\n  * [Cyber Monday 2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/cyber-monday-uk-2018-3342930)\n  * [Cyber Monday Amazon](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/amazon-uk-cyber-monday-3607839)\n  * [Cyber Monday Argos](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/argos-cyber-monday-3606044)\n  * [Cyber Monday Currys PC World](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/currys-pc-world-cyber-monday-3606506)\n  * [Cyber Monday John Lewis](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/john-lewis-cyber-monday-3606735)\n\n_We may earn a commission if you click a deal and buy an item.
