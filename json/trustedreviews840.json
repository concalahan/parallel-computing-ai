But what’s new here is the doubling of the number of lower-powerprocessors, which nobody else has done yet. It’ll be interesting to seewhether Apple is able to improve battery life by shunting off more tasks tothe lower-power cores. We had big complaints about the battery life on theiPhone 7, so it’s here where the A11 Bionic’s power -saving will be mostapparent.When benchmark results start rolling in, we’ll update this page.**Related:[Best iPhone](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-iphone)****Let us know what you think of Apple’s new A11 chip by tweeting us@TrustedReviews.**"}
