Meanwhile, we\nfail to go gaga for a shirt with a baby carrier built in.\n\n**Related:[We’ve backed the Superbook on Kickstarter – here’s why you should\ntoo  \n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/turn-your-phone-into-a-laptop-with-\nthe-superbook-our-kickstarter-pick-of-the-week)**\n\n## What is the Ticwatch 2?\n\n**![ticwatch 2\nproduct](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \n**It’s a smartwatch that you control with gestures and a strip on the side of\nthe face, rather than having to poke the screen. It also runs its own\noperating system, Ticwear OS, which should help it stand out from the Android\nWear crowd.\n\nIt works with both Android handsets and iPhones too, as long as they’re\nrunning at least Android 4.3 or iOS 8.0.\n\n## Why is it interesting?\n\nBecause no one’s really nailed the smartwatch interface yet. For all their\nconvenience, smartwatches are still a bit fiddly – the screens are too small,\nfor one thing, meaning you obscure it whenever you press something. Generally\nspeaking, they’ve been a bit of a let-down. The Ticwear 2 offers another take\non the standard wearable.\n\n**Related:[Why you should fund a System Shock\nremaster](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/system-shock-this-week-s-\nfeatured-kickstarter-crowdfunding-project)  \n**  \n **![ticwatch 2 lying\ndown](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)**\n\nOf course you can swipe and jab the screen as you would with a normal\nsmartwatch, but it also has a touch-sensitive strip up the side of watch face\n(known as the Ticwatch 2 Tickle). This lets you scroll, select, zoom in and\nout, and change volume, all with a swipe your finger. (Or a tickle, if you\nprefer to call it that – which we hope you don’t.) It’s quick, intuitive, and\nit doesn’t cover the screen.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nGesture controls also play a big part of the UI, but unlike with other\nsmartwatches, they seem a bit better thought through. A flick of the wrist\nlets you make a phone call or hang up, while you can knock the side of the\nwatch a couple of times to activate shuffle on a music playlist.\n\nYou can also dim the watch to stealth mode by pressing the screen with your\npalm. And, naturally, voice control comes as standard.\n\nIt does everything a smartwatch should, with health and fitness features, a\nweather app, calculator, calendar, notifications and more – plus, you can\ndownload different watch faces. There’s also the option to swap in a new watch\nstrap whenever you like, with no tool required, giving it as many different\nstyles as most people have outfits.\n\n## What are the challenges?\n\nThe overwhelming challenge is convincing developers to make apps for the\noperating system. Between them, Android and iOS account for more than 90% of\nthe smartphone market, so understandably app makers tend to focus on them in\norder to reach the greatest number of customers. If it wants to convince\ndevelopers to put time and energy into porting their apps to its device,\nMobvoi – the firm behind the Ticwatch 2 – will have its work cut out.\n\n**Related:[Worst crowdfunding\ncampaigns](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/worst-crowdfunding-\ncampaigns-kickstarter-indiegogo)**\n\n**![ticwatch 2\n3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)**\n\nHaving said that, the Uber app is available on the platform, as is Google Fit.\nHopefully others will follow suit.\n\nTo find out more about developing for the device, head to the [developers\nwebsite](http://developer.chumenwenwen.com/en).\n\nAccording to Mobvoi, the fact that the watch contains a lithium battery could\nmake it more difficult to ship. But seeing as pretty much every smartphone in\nthe world has a lithium battery and ships without issue, we can’t see that\nbeing a problem.\n\nFinally, there’s the usual risk of delays because of the supply chain. But\nthat’s the same with any product.\n\nAs ever, there are no guarantees with crowdfunding, so you back projects at\nyour own risk. You pays yer money, you takes yer chances.\n\n## Is there anything similar available?\n\n**![ticwatch 2\nlifestyle](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)**\n\nThe closest is probably the [Moto 360\n2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/moto-360-2-review) or [Samsung Gear\nS2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-gear-s2-review). Both of these\nround smartwatches haven’t fared too badly in reviews, and both have similar\nfeatures to the Ticwatch 2. The Moto 360 2 has gesture controls, and the Gear\nS2 has a rotating bezel that you use to navigate the menu without obscuring\nthe screen.\n\nHowever, if you’re thinking of buying either, don’t. Not yet, at least. Both\nare about a year old, so should be replaced by newer, better versions in the\ncoming weeks. In fact, Samsung has\n[announced](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-gear-s3-3-launch-date-\nrevealed-smartwatch-invite-event-ifa-2016-august-september) it will launch the\nGear S3 at IFA at the end of the month.\n\n## Should I crowdfund this?\n\nIf you’re excited by the prospect of a smartwatch, but have been a little\nunderwhelmed by the current offerings, then yes. It’s raised over $1.3 million\nso far, so has generated plenty of interest.\n\n**Read more:[Best smartwatch 2016: The 8 best wearables to\nbuy](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-smartwatch_round-up)**\n\n**![ticwatch 2 watch\nfaces](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)**\n\nThe cheapest early-bird offers are sold out, but you can pick up the Charcoal\nor Snow edition for $139 (£108). That’s $60 (£46) cheaper than the recommended\nretail price. The Oak or Onyx model can be had for $149 (£115), which is just\nless than half the price you’d pay at retail.\n\nDevelopers can nab a free Ticwatch 2 when they submit an app for its Tickwear\noperating system.\n\n## And one to avoid this week…\n\n**![dad\nshirt](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \n**  \n[The Dad Shirt](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-soothe-shirt-dad-shirt-\nsimple-babywearing-baby#/). Don’t get us wrong, we can see the use of the\nSoothe Shirt – the version of this shirt to help mums breastfeed – but for\ndads? We’re not so sure.\n\nThe idea is sound – you want to carry your child while keeping your hands\nfree. But there are slings that let you do that. There’s no need to build it\ninto a shirt. What happens when, inevitably, your baby is sick on you and your\nDad Shirt needs to be washed? Just buy a sling instead and save yourself some\nmoney.\n\n**Watch The Refresh: The best tech gossip and reviews every week  \n**\n\n****\n\nLet us know what you think of this week’s crowdfunding pick in the comments.\n\n"}
