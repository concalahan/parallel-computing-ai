The highest-end A9F is an OLED TV and will be available in 55-inch and\n65-inch options. The Z9F LED set is the cheaper of the pair and will be come\nin larger 65-inch and 75-inch iterations.\n\nSony says the sets promote a “lens to living room” ethos designed to maintain\nthe artistic vision of cinematographers. “The Master Series provides image\nquality approaching that of a professional monitor in a production studio,”\nsaid Sony’s TV boss Kazou Kii (via [The\nVerge](https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/7/31/17634442/sony-master-\nseries-4k-hdr-tvs-announced-features)).\n\nTo achieve this, Sony is including new features like a Netflix Calibrated\nMode, which is designed to ensure you’re seeing pictures as the content\ncreators intended.\n\n**Related:[Best 4K TV\n2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-4k-tvs)**\n\nNaturally, Netflix is on board with this new mode. The streaming giant’s VP of\ndevice partner ecosystem Scott Mirer says: “Our members can view content as it\nwas meant to be seen, with precise colours, accurate dynamic colours, and true\nmotion so there’s no soap opera effect.”\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nWhether this mode rolls out to more TVs down the line remains to be seen, but\nright now it appears to be a Sony-exclusive offering. That new X1 processor\nalso enables new features like object-based HDR remastering and super\nresolution, so we’re excited to get our eyes on this set.\n\nOn the audio side of things, the higher-end A9F set will feature a new\nAcoustic Surface Audio+ tool, which effectively turns the entire TV into a\n3.2-channel speaker set-up. This tech enables the screen items act as a\nspeaker and, as [Engadget reports](https://www.engadget.com/2018/07/31/sony-\nbravia-master-series/) there’s a centre actuator, a different subwoofer\nchannel and the existing left, right and sub channels.\n\nThere’s no news on pricing yet, but they’ll be available at some point during\nthe autumn. Kii says these sets will be the “best of the best” so don’t expect\nthem to be cheap.\n\n**Will you have your eye out for the Master Series when it arrives later this\nyear?
