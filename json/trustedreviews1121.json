Sound is\nalso set to be improved through new software and hardware tools which will\nallow developers to make use of high-fidelity 3D audio. This should help\ncreate an even more immersive virtual gaming experience.\n\nAlthough exact specs are still lacking, Oculus has promised further details on\nthe headset’s audio abilities “in the coming months”.\n\nWhat we do already know, however, is that in a big to bring more ‘presence’ to\nthe virtual experience, the Facebook-owned Oculus has licensed custom audio\nsoftware from RealSpace3D.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nAs well as giving the headset a more streamlined, refined look, the Crescent\nBay prototype has improved visuals. Unfortunately it is currently unclear the\nexact changes made to the device’s display.\n\nIn a bid to reduce motion sickness complaints made by many to use Rift\nheadsets, Oculus has bestowed the Crescent Bay model with an array of tracking\nLEDs to help reduce disorientation.\n\nWhile the manufacturer is dubbing the latest prototype as “the best virtual\nreality headset” to date, don’t expect to see it on store shelves anytime\nsoon. A consumer release is still a long way off for Rift.\n\n**Read More:**[Sony Project Morpheus\nReview](https://www.trustedreviews.com/project-morpheus_Games-\nAccessory_review)\n\n"}
