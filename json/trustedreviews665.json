There are new watchfaces showing a feed of\ncontextual information from the Google Assistant, information-dense\nnotifications and also a face dedicated to the recently-revamped Google Fit\napp.\n\nBuilding on the changes made in Wear OS 2.0, the biggest change to the UI\nappears to be the addition of rich information screens that can be accessed by\nswiping up, down left and right. Users can just swipe up to see their\nnotification stream, much in the same way Android phone users swipe down. A\nquick tap on a notification will launch smart reply options.\n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-\nprod/original_images/fly-through.gif)\n\nSwiping down surfaces a shortcuts to a number of key settings like Airplane\nMode, Google Pay, Find My Phone and information about battery life, Bluetooth\nconnections and alarms.\n\nMeanwhile, a swipe to the right will launch “proactive and personalised help”\nfrom Google Assistant. Contextual information like flight statuses or hotel\nreservations should appear here. There’ll also be information on the weather,\nyour commute, package deliveries and calendar appointments.\n\n**Related:**[ **Android Pie phones: Will your device get the\nupdate?**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/android-pie-9-phones-3535543)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThose cards will be augmented by smart prompts offering more information on\nthe hourly weather forecast, nearby coffee options, package tracking and the\nrestaurant you’ve booked for later.

The only five watches that won’t be getting the update are the LG G\nWatch, Samsung Gear Live, Moto 360 (2014), Sony Smartwatch 3 and the first\nAsus ZenWatch.\n\n**Can this update help Google reel in the Apple Watch?
