Apple says the CPU has\nmore than 10 billion transistors, and will offer 35% faster single-core speeds\nand 90% faster multi-core performance.\n\nThe CPU will have a 7-core Apple-designed GPU that the company says is 1000\ntimes faster than the old iPad Pro. It claims these are “Xbox One S level”\ngraphics. We’ll have to spend some time with the new models to put these\nclaims to the test.\n\n**Read more:[iPad Pro vs iPad](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ipad-pro-\nvs-ipad-3613041)**\n\nThe 11-inch model has an entry price of £769 ($799 in the US), while the\n12.9-inch version starts at £969 ($999 in the US). They’re [up for pre-order\nright now](https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-pro) from the Apple\nStore, and will start shipping on November 7.\n\nYou can read about the iPad Pro 2018 in full depth\n[here](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ipad-pro-2018-release-date-specs-\nprice-3482812).\n\nThere’s an [Apple Pencil 2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-\npencil-2-2018-features-3612981) too, which magnetically attaches to the iPad\nPro 2018 and charges while it’s stuck there, and a [Smart Keyboard\nfolio](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-smart-keyboard-\nfolio-2018-features-3613051) built specifically for the new tablet.\n\nBut you might want to take a seat for this.

Apple is also promising “48% more colour”\nthan the previous gen Air’s screen.\n\nThe bezel around it, we’re pleased to report, has been slimmed-down\nsignificantly, resulting in a laptop that looks much more current. The new\nMacBook Air is claimed to be 17% smaller than its predecessor and weighs in at\n1.25kg.\n\nThere’s Touch ID too, so all you need to do to unlock the new MacBook Air and\nauthenticate purchases is scan your finger on a key in the bottom-left corner\nof the keyboard.\n\nUnfortunately, that’s a butterfly-style keyboard, which we’ve heard _loads_ of\ncomplaints about over the past couple of years. Has it been improved? We’ll\nhave to wait and see. There’s also an always-on audio processor for constant\nSiri support and a Force Touch trackpad.\n\nIn terms of ports, you’ll get two\n[USB-C](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/usb-type-c-everything-you-need-\nto-know-2932202) ports supporting Thunderbolt 3, along with a 3.5mm headphone\njack.\n\nThe top-end storage option is a 1.5TB SSD, while the maximum amount of memory\nyou’ll be able to get in your new MacBook Air is 16GB of 2133MHz RAM.\n\nA dual-core 8th gen Intel Core i5 CPU with a base clock speed of 1.6GHz and\nboost speed of 3.6GHz runs the show, but there’s no word on the exact model\nyet. As it’s dual-core and not quad-core, it’s a safe bet that it’s not a\nWhiskey Lake processor.\n\nApple says every new MacBook Air is also made “from 100% recycled aluminium”.\nYou can find out more about that process\n[here](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/macbook-air-mac-mini-recycled-\naluminium-3612877).\n\nThere are three colour options to choose from − Space Grey, Gold and Silver −\nand you can [pre-order the new MacBook Air](https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-\nmac/macbook-air) right now from the Apple Store. It will start shipping on\nNovember 7.\n\n£1199 gets you 128GB of storage, which you can boost to 256GB for £1399.

Aimed at professionals and creatives rather than\nyour average computer user, the new Mac mini 2018 has had a hefty performance\nboost compared with the previous iteration.\n\nIt features a quad-core 8th Generation Intel CPU with the option to upgrade to\nsix cores. Apple claims that this equates to speeds up to five times faster\nthan the previous iteration of the Mac mini.\n\nThe memory has had a whopping upgrade, now with 2666MHz DDR4 SO-DIMM and\nsupport for up to 64GB of RAM. You also get up to 2TB of flash storage, which\nis a lot of space for even the most proactive of creatives. Apple claims the\nnew Mac mini 2018’s SSDs are four times faster than what the previous\ngeneration offered.\n\nIn terms of ports, it has Ethernet (10GB available), HDMI, a headphone jack,\ntwo USB-A and four Thunderbolt ports.\n\nThe new Mac mini 2018 will cost £799 in the UK, with the six-core model coming\nin at £1099. You can [pre-order the new Mac\nMini](https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-mac/mac-mini) right now, and it will\nalso start shipping on November 7.
