Take a look at our guide below on how to do so.**\n\n## **Windows 10 Creators Update at a glance:**\n\n**Windows 10 Creators Update release date:** April 11th  \n **Device compatibility:** All Windows 10 devices (Ink features for Ink-\nenabled devices only)  \n **Key features:** Paint 3D, Ink enhancements, new Edge features\n\n## When can I get the Creators Update?\n\nMicrosoft has announced today that the Creators Update will begin rolling out\non April 11th. But because 400 million PCs run Windows 10, the update will be\nstaggered so you’ll be in the minority if you get it on day one.\n\nThe company has stated that anyone who wants to download and install the\nupdate manually may do so, and will be providing a download for the new\nversion on the Microsoft website. When that link is live we’ll update this\npiece with more information.\n\nIf you want it now, take a look at our guide below.  \n **  \nRelated:[Best laptops to buy](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-\nlaptops_round-up \"Best laptop\")**\n\n## Do I need the Creators Update?\n\nIt’s a mandatory update, so like it or not you’ll get it. It doesn’t make\nanything about Windows 10 worse (as far as we can see), so even if you don’t\nlike the big new features, under-the-hood security enhancements will make your\nlife easier.\n\nAt _Trusted_ Towers, we’re not hugely enthralled by the update; there’s not a\nhuge amount here that will change the way many of us work. Those who fancy\ndabbling in a bit of 3D work or fancy streaming their games for free in a\ncouple of clicks will be happy, but everyone else will probably carry on as\nnormal. The fact this update has a big, fancy name doesn’t really hide the\nfact that it won’t revolutionise Windows 10 in any way.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n## How to download Windows 10 Creators Update\n\nMicrosoft has made it very easy to download the latest version of Windows 10\nmanually, and the latest version available contains all the key features of\nthe Creators Update.  \n**  \nRelated:[Read our verdict on the Windows 10 Creators\nUpdate](https://www.trustedreviews.com/windows-10-review \"Windows 10 Creators\nUpdate\")**\n\nSimply head to the [Windows 10 Media Creation\ntool](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10 \"Windows 10\nmedia creation\") page on Microsoft’s website. You should see a grey bar that\nstates “We noticed you are running Windows 10. If you would like to update to\nthe latest version, click Update now.”![Download\nW10](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nClick on the ‘Update Now’ button and follow the steps in the window that\nopens, and that should do the trick! The download will run in the background\n(and is around 3.5GB) and will then ask you to restart to finalise the\ninstallation.  \n![Download\ntool](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThere are fewer risks involved with downloading the update this way compared\nto signing up to the Insider scheme that Microsoft runs for Windows 10, but\nit’s always worth making a failsafe recovery backup of Windows if you have\nstuff you don’t want to lose. Search for ‘recovery’ in the Start Menu to get\none set up before you download the Creators Update.\n\n## Top 6 features\n\n**Paint 3D**  \nIn its effort to make Windows 10 the operating system of choice for fans of 3D\ncontent and children, Microsoft has developed Paint 3D, which is a brand-new,\npre-installed application that lets you make basic 3D scenes.\n\nIt’s an interesting move, with Microsoft seemingly trying to kickstart a\nmarket that doesn’t have a huge amount of scale right now.\n\nThe app itself is impressively simple and behaves almost identically to a 2D\nimaging app, with some extra features to let you rotate objects and move them\nbackwards and forwards in 3D space. ![Windows 10 Creators\n1](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nYou can create scenes from nothing or start with one of your own images and\nconvert it into 3D using a clever magic wand tool that pulls notable objects,\nsuch as people, into separate layers that you can move back and forth.\n\nDon’t have the skills to make your own 3D objects? You’ll be able to download\nnew content from the Remix 3D content store, which is built into Paint 3D.\nSimply search for the sort of object you’re looking for and slap it straight\ninto your new 3D scene.\n\nWhen you’re done, you can convert it into a 2D image, or export it as a 3D\nobject that can be opened in other 3D programs. You can also 3D print your\ncreations the 3D printer you almost certainly don’t own, or send it off to a\n3D printing service to have it mailed to you. This could be fun for creating\n3D greetings cards, although a little more expensive than just grabbing an\nold-world, 2D card from your local Paperchase.\n\nYou can download a preview of Paint 3D [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-\nus/store/p/paint-3d-preview/9nblggh5fv99 \"Paint 3D\").\n\n**Game Mode**  \nGame Mode sounds like the sort of feature rubbish antivirus packages use to\nmake you think they’re not completely destroying your computer’s performance.\nBut Microsoft insists it will actually help you get more consistent\nperformance when you’re playing games, which will probably be helpful on mid-\nspec PCs and laptops being pushed to their limits by the latest games.\n\nThe feature is said to prioritise gaming tasks above all else, with background\ntasks and other programs getting lower priority. This new feature hasn’t been\nfully detailed, and Microsoft says the performance gains will vary by device\nand usage, so hasn’t put a number on it.![Windows 10\nCreators](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe Game Bar, accessed by hitting Windows+G now lets you stream through the\nBeam streaming platform. This isn’t YouTube or Twitch, but Beam’s apparent\nkiller feature is its low-latency streaming, which means viewers see the\naction a second after it happens on the streamer’s PC. This means the audience\ncan interact in a more instantaneous way, which is good for some games where\nthe streamer might want the audience to be able to make a big choice.\n\n**Edge updates**\n\nMicrosoft has improved how the Edge web browser handles tabs. Instead of just\nopening loads of tabs and windows, you can now just park the set of tabs you\ncurrently have open and return to them later. That means, for example, if\nyou’re about to take a lunch break and want do do some online shopping, you\ncan park your work-related tabs and come back to them when you’re done.\n\nThe buttons for this can be found on the top-left of the Edge window, with the\nrightmost button parking the tabs, and the left button allowing you to see all\nthe tabs you’ve parked recently.![Windows 10\nCreators](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Related:[Best web browsers tested](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-web-\nbrowser_round-up \"Best web browser\")  \n**  \nWe don’t think this feature alone will see Edge bouncing up our Best Browser\nrankings, but it’s a handy feature nonetheless.\n\nEdge has also received tab thumbnails, which let you preview a tab’s contents\nwithout clicking on it.\n\nOther additional features include the ability to play Netflix in 4K, if your\ncomputer has a 4K screen and an [Intel Kaby\nlake](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/intel-7th-gen-kaby-lake-\nspecifications \"Kaby Lake\") processor.\n\n**Night Light**\n\nFed of of bright blue light ruining your sleep? Windows 10 will now give you\nthe option to switch on a blue light reduction mode that can be activated at\nscheduled times. This means you’ll be able to set your PC to tone down the\nharsh vibes after the sun sets to prevent your body from being fooled by the\nblue light of modern LCD screens.\n\n**Photos and video updates**\n\nYour photos are now searchable by time, date, location, people and objects.\nThis is similar to how Microsoft’s OneDrive automatically tags images with\nobjects it thinks it sees, and brings the same functionality over to the\npictures stored on your device.\n\nThe Movies & TV app now supports picture-in-picture mode, which means you can\nhave a small video playing on top of any other window. The app also now\nsupports 360 videos natively.\n\n**Ink updates**\n\nYou can now draw directly onto photos and videos using Windows Ink. In\naddition, you can now draw directly onto 3D maps in the Maps app, which is an\nenhancement over the Anniversary Update, which just let you draw onto 2D maps.\nDraw onto the map and the app will create you a route based on your drawings,\nwhich is fairly cool.\n\n## Fewer naggy updates and random restarts\n\nThis will please a lot of people. Microsoft has now made it possible to snooze\nan update for several days days, meaning you won’t get any more unexpected\nrestarts when you walked away from your PC for a few minutes. That’s not to\nsay you can just ignore them forever; you still need to be aware of when your\nPC will eventually restart, but it’s a big piece of progress for an operating\nsystem that’s had real problems with randomly restarting.\n\nYou can also set specific ‘active hours’ at which point your device will never\nreboot. This means you won’t be interrupted at all during the working day, for\nexample.\n\n"}
