Last year we got the [Nexus\n6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/nexus-6-review), a highly capable but rather\nhuge phablet that had none of its predecessor’s compact charm.\n\nNow we appear to have been granted a good, clear look at the new Nexus 5 from\nthe rear, courtesy of [AndroidPit](https://www.androidpit.com/exclusive-\nnexus-5-2015-revealed). The website stresses that this is the real thing, and\nnot a press render.\n\nAs you can see, the shot tallies with the leaked images we’ve already seen for\nthe phone. This new Nexus features the exact same round, matte plastic design\nwith that curious rear-mounted circular motif. We’re guessing that last\nfeature is a fingerprint sensor.\n\nThere’s also a dual-LED flash and laser auto-focus module visible just above\nthe camera.\n\nOther things to expect from the second-generation Nexus 5 is a 5.2-inch\ndisplay, a USB-C port and dual front-facing speakers. It could also be powered\nby a Snapdragon 808 CPU with 3 GB of RAM.  \n **  \nSEE ALSO:[Best Android Smartphones 2015](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-\nandroid-phones-1_round-up)**\n\nNaturally, Google will showcase its latest OS with this new hardware – in this\ncase Android 6.0 Marshmallow.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nExpect to see Google announcing its new Nexus 5 at a special [September 29\nevent](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/report-google-to-announce-new-\nnexus-phones-on-september-29).  \n **  \nCheck out our smartphone group test video below:**\n\n"}
