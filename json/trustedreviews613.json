Although, if\nyou’re the wearer of one of Fitbit’s many popular fitness trackers – such as\nthe [Fitbit Charge 2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/fitbit-charge-2-review)\nor [Fitbit Blaze](https://www.trustedreviews.com/fitbit-blaze-review) – then\nyou might have seen it referred to as a ‘Cardio Fitness’ score. Polar, on the\nother hand, calls it a Polar Fitness Test.\n\nFundamentally, all of these are based around your VO2 Max. But what exactly is\na VO2 Max test? And how can you apply the score to your training so you can\nmake tangible improvements to your health and fitness? Keep reading for all\nthat and more.  \n **  \nRelated:[B est Fitbit](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-fitbit_round-up)**\n\n## What does a VO2 Max score mean?\n\n![VO2 Max\ntest](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)_Image credit:[Fort\nCarson](https://www.flickr.com/photos/fortcarson/8390531222/in/photolist-\ndMrEBq-cF3Xt-5JQ2Hj-p3PtFc-EonDZ-Eonya-7EineC-\nqEAzSj-4kvBwy-e3t4BA-7EimXo-7Ein2E-4yrPQm-gKkJr-rMDkU6-rvh6HB-rKrA8Y-rMDkKZ-\nrMBNE5-rtpPBx)_\n\nIn essence, your VO2 Max is a measure of your body’s maximal oxygen uptake\nability. It looks at how much oxygen your body can take in when you’re pushing\nyourself during aerobic exercise. Your score is measured in millilitres of\noxygen per kilogram of body mass per minute – which in itself requires a\nsizeable lung capacity just to say.\n\nThe idea is that your VO2 Max score is a good indicator of a subject’s\ncardiovascular endurance and aerobic performance. As with many other metrics,\nit can be a useful measurement to track progress over time. As you train and\nbecome fitter, your VO2 Max score should improve as your body becomes more\nefficient.\n\n## How is a true VO2 Max tested?\n\nTraditionally, testing your VO2 Max required expensive equipment – the sort\navailable in high-tech sports science facilities. This would entail putting a\ntest subject on a treadmill, cranking equipment up to the max, and then\nmeasuring the subject’s oxygen levels of inhaled and exhaled air.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nImagine the [Rocky IV training montage](https://youtu.be/1SUzcDUERLo?t=3m11s)\nwhere Ivan Drago is busting a gut on the treadmill, but rather than having\nsensors stuck to his body, he’s also forced to wear an oxygen mask to\nexacerbate his sheer agony.\n\nNeedless to say, the whole process is far from a pleasant experience. Once the\nfigures are obtained, all those numbers are plugged into a specific formula,\nwhich generates a VO2 Max score.\n\n## How do fitness trackers estimate a VO2 Max?\n\nThankfully, for those of us who don’t have access to a sports science lab,\nthere are easier ways by which you can get your VO2 Max score thanks to a\nrange of fitness trackers and wearables on the market.\n\nThere is a caveat, though. As you might imagine, the results aren’t going to\nbe anywhere near as accurate as those you’d get from a full on VO2 Max test\nconducted under laboratory conditions. This is simply because far more guess\nwork is at play in order to generate a score.\n\nFor starters, you don’t have an oxygen mask attached to your face, which is\ngoing to be less intrusive but also far less accurate. Many wrist-worn fitness\ntrackers will instead use a combination of data sources to calculate your VO2\nMax, normally in conjunction with your heart rate. Fitbit, for example,\ncalculates your Cardio Fitness score using heart rate, age, weight and gender\nto make an estimation.  \n **  \nRelated:[Best Fitness trackers](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-fitness-\ntracker_round-up) **\n\n![Fitbit Charge\n2](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nMany manufacturers have licensed a patented method of estimating your VO2 Max\ncalled the\n[Firstbeat](https://www.firstbeat.com/app/uploads/2015/10/white_paper_vo2_estimation.pdf)\nmethod. This uses the relationship between oxygen consumption and running\nspeed in combination with your heart rate. The idea is that your oxygen\nrequirement increases with running speed in a linear way.\n\nA device will usually require GPS to accurately measure your external\nworkload, which in this case is your running pace measured against the\ninternal workload, which is your heart rate.\n\nIt’s believed that this method can achieve 95% accuracy compared to lab tests,\nbut you’ll need to pay attention to your running route. Running uphill, for\nexample, can throw off the numbers as your physical exertion is high but your\npace is low. Most device manufacturers recommend conducting their tests on\neven terrain for this reason.  \n **  \nRelated:[Best running watches](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-running-\nwatches_round-up)  \n**  \n![Polar\nM600](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nBeyond the added convenience versus a gruelling VO2 Max test under lab\nconditions, the other benefit is merely having another metric readily\navailable with which you can measure your ongoing progress – few of us have\nthe time to check our true VO2 Max regularly.\n\nWhile the numbers might be a little off, from experience I’ve found that VO2\nMax tests from wrist-worn devices – such as the [Polar\nM600](https://www.trustedreviews.com/polar-m600-review) – and in-ear heart\nrate monitoring headphones like the [Jabra Elite\nSport](https://www.trustedreviews.com/jabra-sport-elite-review) have been\nconsistent over time.\n\nSo provided you use the numbers generated as a measure across your fitness\njourney, it’s still a great way to keep tabs on improvements or adjust your\ntraining if you find yourself slipping.\n\n## What benefits do you get from having a high VO2 Max?\n\nSince a high VO2 Max is shown to correlate with cardio-respiratory fitness,\nany aerobic (‘with oxygen’) activity such as running, swimming or cycling will\nsee an added benefit. Your performance in sports such as football, basketball\nor tennis will also improve with proper training.\n\nWith increased lung and heart performance, your body is able to better deliver\noxygen to your muscles, which aids in increasing endurance and required\neffort. If you’re a runner, increasing your VO2 Max should result in an\nincrease in pace against the effort you put in.\n\nThis means that as your VO2 Max increases, your body won’t have to work quite\nso hard to run an 8-minute mile compared to when you started out, enabling you\nto increase your pace without busting a lung.\n\nVO2 Max has its limitations, though. Having the highest VO2 Max score among\nyour friends or running club members won’t guarantee you’ll be the quickest –\nor be able to run the furthest. As with all things pertaining to athletic\nperformance, there are other variables at play, such as the speed at which a\nperson reaches their VO2 Max threshold, which is often referred to as ‘vVO2\nMax’.  \n**  \nRelated:[Best calorie counter\napps](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/best-calorie-counter-\napps-5-best-food-diaries-for-android-and-ios)  \n**  \n![Jabra\nSport](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \nA high VO2 Max doesn’t necessarily translate to increased anaerobic\nperformance (‘without oxygen’) in the same way, which relates more to\nstrength, speed and power. As a result, a weightlifter might not be too\nconcerned with their VO2 Max score – although for overall health reasons,\nperhaps they should.\n\nEven then, keeping tabs on your VO2 Max can be a useful metric given these\nlimitations. If anything, it’s a more concrete measure of your effort level\nand exertion during a workout and removes some of the subjectivity of the\npost-run self survey used by many running apps to rate how you actually felt.\n\nA gradually increasing VO2 Max is a motivator, while if you notice it tailing\noff this could mean it’s time to reassess your training approach or simply\ngive yourself a kick up the back side. As a tool that’s now readily available\non running watches and fitness trackers, it’s certainly something worth\nkeeping an eye on.  \n **  \nRelated:[Workout logs are the key to getting fitter – here’s\nwhy](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/why-workout-logs-are-the-key-to-\ngetting-fitter)**\n\n## How can I improve my VO2 Max?\n\nNot surprisingly, regular training will be the best route to improving your\nVO2 Max. As your general level of fitness increases, so too will your VO2 Max.\nImprovements to VO2 Max will be non-linear, as with many aspects relating to\nperformance, though.\n\nThis means beginners and novices will see far more rapid improvements as they\nintroduce cardiovascular training, whereas a more advanced or elite runner\nwill find improvements become much slower.\n\nTraining at your VO2 Max, as in running at your upper threshold, has also been\nshown to help improve your VO2 Max performance.\n\n## What devices support VO2 Max tests?\n\n![Polar\nM600](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nA quick, but not exhaustive, list of devices that can be used for a VO2 Max\ntest include:\n\n  * [Fitbit Charge 2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/fitbit-charge-2-review)\n  * [Fitbit Blaze](https://www.trustedreviews.com/fitbit-blaze-review)\n  * [Fitbit Surge](https://www.trustedreviews.com/fitbit-surge-review)\n  * [Garmin Forerunner 735XT](https://www.trustedreviews.com/garmin-forerunner-735xt-review)\n  * [Garmin Forerunner 920XT](https://www.trustedreviews.com/garmin-forerunner-920xt-review)\n  * [Garmin Vivosmart HR Plus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/garmin-vivosmart-hr-plus-review)\n  * Garmin Vivoactive HR\n  * [Jabra Sport Pulse](https://www.trustedreviews.com/jabra-sport-pulse-review)\n  * [Jabra Elite Sport](https://www.trustedreviews.com/jabra-sport-elite-review)\n  * [Polar A360](https://www.trustedreviews.com/polar-a360-review)\n  * [Polar M400](https://www.trustedreviews.com/polar-m400-review)\n  * [Polar M600](https://www.trustedreviews.com/polar-m600-review)\n\nOddly, while many of the hardware requirements are present for an estimated\nVO2 Max calculation, TomTom currently doesn’t offer any VO2 Max calculations\non its running watches such as the [TomTom Spark\n3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/tomtom-spark-3-review-review).\n\n**  \nWhat do you think of VO2 Max measurements?
