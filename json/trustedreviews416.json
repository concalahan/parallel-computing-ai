They have hired people we’ve fired,” Musk told\n[Handelsblatt](https://global.handelsblatt.com/edition/271/ressort/companies-\nmarkets/article/all-charged-up-in-berlin). “We always jokingly call Apple the\n“Tesla Graveyard.” If you don’t make it at Tesla, you go work at Apple. I’m\nnot kidding.”\n\nThis prompted the interviewer to ask Musk, whose company had recently launched\nthe [Tesla Model X](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/tesla-model-x-\nannounced) to considerable acclaim, whether he was taking Apple’s e-car\nambitions seriously. Musk took the opportunity to offer a slightly more\ngracious response, but framed it with more stinging insults.\n\n“Did you ever take a look at the Apple Watch? (laughs) No, seriously: It’s\ngood that Apple is moving and investing in this direction,” said Musk.\n\n**Related:[Elon Musk’s 5 craziest tech ideas for the\nfuture](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/elon-musk-5-craziest-tech-\nideas-for-the-future)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nMusk also cautioned Apple that “cars are very complex compared to phones or\nsmartwatches,” and pointed out that you can’t just go to Foxconn and ask them\nto build you a car.\n\nHe accepts that “for Apple, the car is the next logical thing to finally offer\na significant innovation,” but ended his assessment by claiming that “a new\npencil or a bigger iPad alone were not relevant enough.” Ouch.\n\n**See how useful we found the Apple Watch to be in the following video:**\n\n"}
