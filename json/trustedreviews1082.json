Well, sort of – but in Dying Light 2, just like its\npredecessor, you’re expected to refer to them as ‘infected’. But there’s\nlittle time for semantics in a world devastated by a viral outbreak, and with\nplenty of the population dead, dying, or undead and hungry.\n\nThe original Dying Light flew under the radar for a while, eventually building\nitself a strong foundation of support and worming its way into the library of\nmany gamers. And it’s easy to see why – what initially looked like another\nzombie shooter revealed itself to be a mix of brutal melee combat, terrifying\nhorror, and skillful parkour moves.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nIt’s not surprising that Dying Light 2 picks up where the original left off\nfrom a mechanics perspective – on the surface this is business as usual:\nyou’re in a city littered with both infected and hostile humans (as well as\nsome friendly types), it’s open for you to explore and complete missions as\nyou see fit, and you really will want to hide when the night comes.\n\n**Related:[Upcoming PS4 Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/upcoming-\nps4-games) **\n\n![dying light 2\n](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nThis time around though, there’s a bunch more to it: parkour has been doubled\ndown on – almost quite literally – with two times the number of moves and\nanimations available to players. It’s also backed up with a ‘parkour puzzle’\nsystem, requiring players to use their dashing-jumping-dangling skills\ncarefully and with consideration to make their way through an area – rather\nthan just running and leaping without a second thought about anything. It’s\ncertainly more involved than, say, Assassin’s Creed’s version of free running.\n\nThe parkour puzzle we were shown also involved another updated element –\nobjects with actual physics modeling. What this means is things like ropes act\nlike ropes – and what _that_ means is when you’re haring it across a series of\nwindow ledges desperately trying to escape from whatever it is that’s chasing\nyou, you can swing heroically out of danger on a rope. Which is obviously\namazing.\n\nSaid things that chase you have seen updates for Dying Light 2 as well, with\nserious work being put in by developer Techland to both the infected and\nhuman’s complexity. The undead masses are a bit smarter than before, and\nthough they’re far less of a threat than they were in the daytime last time\naround, you’ll be wanting to steer clear of most of them in the night when the\nstrength-sapping sun isn’t shining.\n\nThat’s not to say you’ll be safe in the daylight, though, with marauding gangs\nof reprobates roaming the streets, looking for trouble, trying to loot\nseemingly empty properties, and generally making a nuisance of themselves. New\ndynamic encounters erupt on the fly and can play out in a multitude of\ndifferent ways, depending both on how the AI reacts and how the player sees\nfit to tackle the situation.\n\n**Related:[Best Xbox One Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-xbox-\none-games-3435271)**\n\n![dying light 2\n](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nDuring our demo session we were shown one such encounter – the player stumbled\non a small gang breaking into a deserted building with the hopes of finding\nsomething valuable. Sneaking around – and using parkour skills, of course –\nthe player was able to take out a couple of guards before being spotted. Thus\nbegins the melee combat system – another feather in Dying Light 2’s hat –\nwhich is as brutal as it is tactical, requiring genuine presence of mind to be\nable to take on human enemies. They want to live just as much as you do, after\nall.\n\nAlas, someone fired a weapon, alerting the other gang members to the fracas –\nand waking up the sleeping infected who were inside the not-so-abandoned\nbuilding. Time to flee, and flee the player does in style, climbing, dashing,\nleaping, swinging, and eventually making their way to safety. It’s\nexhilarating just to watch, and this wasn’t even a main mission in Dying Light\n2.\n\nThose core campaign missions are where the other big change in the sequel\nshines through: the element of choice. In the original you had the choice of\nwhether to actually bother doing things or just milling about aimlessly, sure,\nbut it wasn’t a serious, impactful choice that changed the world around you.\n\nIn Dying Light 2, players are presented with choices as they move through the\nstory – each one, even seemingly insignificant, can have a huge impact on the\nworld around them. The example we were shown involved a water tower under the\ncontrol of a local gang – the Peace Keepers, formed in the wake of the viral\noutbreak and trying to restore some form of order to the new world, want the\ngang gone so it can give the water freely to innocent civilians in the area.\n\nPlayers have to make their way to the top of the tower where the gang leader\nresides. When they get there, after a bit of a chat, he offers the player a\nchoice: join him, reap the rewards, keep the Peace Keepers out. Naturally the\nplayer tells him where to go, kicks the boss man off the top of the tower, and\ngives the PK force control of the supply.\n\n**Related:[Cyberpunk\n2077](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/cyberpunk-2077-release-date-\ngameplay-trailer-2948412)**\n\n![dying light 2\n](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nWe jump forward a few days and the area is changed almost completely –\nsympathetic factions have moved in, new constructions like lifts make\nnavigation much easier for the player, and water is freely available for the\nhappy locals (and player, who can restore their health with a sip). Heaven on\na post-apocalyptic earth, then?\n\nOf course not. While on the surface things look great – and in many ways they\nare – there’s something just below a bit _sinister_ about the Peace Keepers.\nFor one, they way they deal with gang members still loitering in the area is\nbrutal, not even allowing them a chance to repent for their previous actions.\nAnd for two, even the regular populace is ruled over with an iron fist, and\nthe most minor of crimes are punished aggressively. Relative peace reigns, but\nthe Peace Keepers _reign_.\n\nRewinding back to the choice, we’re shown what happens when the player agrees\nto join with the gang. Skipping forward the region is not in anywhere near as\ngood a shape as when the PK’s took over, with fires raging, gang activity\nincreased and the risk of infected attack higher than ever. Oh, and nobody\ngets water for free, so plenty are left to die of thirst. Naturally.\n\nBut there are benefits to the player, and ones that genuinely will convince\nsome to choose this option for ultimately benevolent reasons. One, they\nreceive a regular income from the selling of the water supply, meaning money\nis less of a worry – and two, owing to the lack of lawmakers in the area, a\nblack market opens and can be visited by the player.\n\n## First Impressions\n\nThe greater good might well need some items from that black market – and if\nyou save the city, or more lives than were lost in this region, thanks to the\nmoney and goods that come from siding with the gang, isn’t it the more\ncompassionate choice? We don’t know, but seeing as Dying Light 2 already has\nus asking the hard questions, we’re really looking forward to seeing what\nother moral quandaries it puts us in next year.\n\n**Are you excited to play more Dying Light?
