However this game isn’t based solely on the historical\nevents of that era, it’s drawing much of its inspiration from a Chinese novel\ncalled Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Written in the 14th century, it heavily\ndramatises the lives and actions of many of the real people involved.\n\nFor example, while the military general Xiahou Dun, who lost his left eye to\nan arrow, is thought to have then spent the remainder of his career away from\nthe frontlines, this is not the case in this romanticised retelling of events.\nInstead, he is said to have pulled out the arrow along with his eyeball, eaten\nit in front of his troops, and then killed an enemy officer in single combat.\n\n**Related:[Best Strategy Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/strategy-\ngames-2018-3525615)**\n\n![Total War Three\nKingdoms](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSo what does that mean for the game’s direction? Is this a historical Total\nWar game, or not? We asked Creative Assembly.\n\n“Quite quickly on,” said communications manager, Al Bickham, “we got to a\npoint where the designers realised we needed both a classic and fantasy mode.\nAdding bits of one to the other just felt like a constant compromise, so we\nwent: okay, let’s be true to the historical epic and the history at the same\ntime.”\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\n“That was super interesting,” added senior game designer, Attila Mohacsi. “The\ncore of the team was coming from Total War: Attila and so we were just\nthinking about making one version. As we started reading through all of the\nsource material, we kept trying to push more and more with the romance side of\nit and we realised we weren’t quite there.\n\n“The game would have been quite strange for the historical audience and so we\nthought about going the other way: how much of the fantasy stuff can we trim\ndown? Again, it didn’t feel right. In the end, we just had to seperate it.\nThere was no other way that people would be happy with what we were making.”\n\nAs of yet, we’ve only been hands-on with the Romance mode in Three Kingdoms\nand although the bulk of the units on the battlefield were in keeping with\nhistory, there was one thing that stood out from the moment we began playing:\nthe generals.\n\n**Related:[Upcoming Xbox One\nGames](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/upcoming-xbox-one-\ngames-2018-3531040)**\n\n![Best pc games: warhammer 2 total\nwar](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nUnlike in other historical Total War games, there’s no unit of bodyguards\nsurrounding these leaders in Romance mode and they absolutely don’t need them.\nJust like in Warhammer 1 and 2, these characters can wade right into the\nmiddle of combat and stand their own against dozens, maybe hundreds of enemy\nsoldiers at a time.\n\n“Characters are the biggest thing we’ve learnt from the Warhammer games, I\nthink,” said Bickham.\n\n“We wanted to do it anyway,” continued Mohacsi, “but seeing how people reacted\nto the Warhammer characters was a great confirmation that this could work. At\ntimes we had doubts about how it would feels in a historical game, but that’s\nwhy we have the two different modes.”\n\nA straight comparison with the legendary lords of Total War: Warhammer doesn’t\nquite do it justice, it has to be said. At a recent hands-on event, we were\nplaying as Sun Ren as she fended off an enemy ambush and were surprised to see\none of her abilities, a flaming arrow called Heart Seeker, oneshot a low level\nenemy general in the first few moments of the battle. As impressive as\nWarhammer’s spells can be, Total War has never seen anything quite like that.\n\n“One major difference from Warhammer is that the skills are all very\nimpactful,” said Mohacsi. “Every time you engage with the skill tree, you’ll\nhave a major choice to make. You’ll have a limited amount of skill points to\nspend and you have to decide what’s most important to you.\n\n“One thing we wanted to shift away from is that in previous games many units\nhad many, many abilities, but the punch of that unit didn’t always come\nthrough. Now it’s only the generals that have abilities, but when they use\nthem, you feel it. They make a huge difference. To counterbalance this, the\ncooldowns are longer, but it’s a decisive moment in the battle.”\n\n**Related:[Best RPGs](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-rpg-3523043)**\n\n![Total War Three\nKingdoms](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nEach character belongs to a different class, which determines their overall\nplaystyle on the battlefield. Sun Ren is a Vanguard, meaning she excels at\nfighting large numbers of soldiers with big sweeping attacks that can knock\nback multiple opponents with each swing.\n\nHer brother, Sun Quan favours quite a different approach. As a Commander, he\nprefers to stay behind the frontline, providing huge buffs to the units around\nhim. In the battle we played, he was able to temporarily negate all melee and\nranged damage to nearby soldiers. Not some of the damage, all of it. Again, it\nmade Total War: Warhammer’s abilities seem almost tepid by comparison.\n\nAlthough we’re yet to play it, we know this stuff won’t be as powerful in\nClassic Mode. For a start, the generals will again be accompanied by a unit of\nbodyguards, just like in previous historical games. And although they’ll have\naccess to a number of abilities and buffs for nearby units, they won’t be able\nto single-handedly turn a battle in the same way.\n\nSo what does that mean for Total War? In a post-Warhammer world, are there now\ntwo distinct audiences for these games? Historical and fantasy?\n\n“Definitely,” said Bickham, “but I think there’s a big venn diagram there.\nThere’s a lot of crossover in between as well. You’ve got a hardcore group of\npeople that only love the history games, then you’ve got a load of people that\nenjoy both, as long as it’s a cool game doing cool stuff, and some people just\nwant Warhammer. It’s a big old spectrum.”\n\nIt remains to be seen how effectively Creative Assembly can cater to both\nwithin the very same game.\n\n**Are you excited to see Total War return to historical battlefields in Three\nKingdoms?
