It’s a sleek SUV filled with smart technology and high-\nend specs – and there’s even a host of new concept images showing off the\nvehicle’s interior and exterior in all its luxe glory.**\n\nPrior to the Consumer Electronics Show, we were given a sneak peak at the\nByton car created by a spin-off of Chinese tech startup Future Mobility,\nnoting how it blends a massive infotainment setup with level 4 self-driving\ncapabilities.\n\nBut now we can get a full view of the Byton. As its teaser images suggested,\nit sports an angular, swept-back SUV design.\n\nHowever, it also has a few swish features that weren’t hinted at the initial\nteasing Byton did ahead of CES 2018 in the outlines.\n\nSuch features include the way the front seats turn to face the rear one when\nthe car is in autonomous mode, as well as the presence of large displays\nattached to the rear of the front seats to provide rear passenger\nentertainment and information.\n\nApparently able to make the sprint to 60mph in around five seconds, the\n$45,000 Byton is not as nippy as similar Tesla cars, but offers a more tech-\nheavy experience. Eventually this should allow drivers to abandon the wheel\nand interact with the infotainment suite on offer, which they can do using\ntouch, voice or gesture controls.\n\nHere’s a handful of our favourite Byton car concept images for your pleasure.\nLooks pretty swish, no?\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n## Byton electric car in pictures\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Byton Electric Car: The road ahead\n\nWhen the first car rolls off the production line it will only be capable of\nlevel 3 autonomous driving, meaning a driver will need to remain alert when\nbehind the wheel.\n\nThe BBC reported that there are concerns over the charging infrastructure\nByton will need to support its electric cars. The company has ambitions to\nenter into partnership with Tesla, which has fast-charging stations in place\naround the world.\n\n“It seems highly unlikely that Tesla will want to share the infrastructure\nthey’ve worked so hard to build with a rival – unless there’s some kind of\naltruistic view that it’s for the greater good,” commented Ben Wood, an\nanalyst at CCS Insight [told](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-42599345)\nthe BBC.\n\n“It underlines the challenges of electric vehicles. Building the cars is\nrelatively simple these days, but you need everything that goes around it.\nCharging infrastructure, more than anything, is the challenge.”\n\nThat being said, Tesla has in the past been open to sharing its charging\nstations, and Byton is confident that it can overcome any charging road bumps.\n\nWe’ll have to wait until the end of 2019, when the Byton cars are expected to\nhit the road en masse, to see if the company’s confidence pays off.\n\n**Related:[Best concept cars](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/concept-\ncars-3287706)**\n\n**Is the Byton the future of cars or merely a concept that won’t take off?
