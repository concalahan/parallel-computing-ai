That’s what Chinese company\nYongnuo has attempted with its forthcoming YN450.**\n\nUnlike the [Samsung Galaxy\nCamera](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-camera) from\n2013, the Yongnuo YN450 is more camera-meets-Android phone than vice versa.\n\nIt has a 16-megapixel Four Thirds sensor, which on paper puts it in the\nballpark of something like the [Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark\nIII](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/olympus-om-d-e-m10-mark-iii), and\nruns Android 7.1 Nougat, putting it a couple of years behind today’s flagship\nphones.\n\nStill, it’s an interesting combination if you fancy combining the dynamic\nrange and low light skills of a Four Thirds sensor with the ability to\nimmediately fire shots to Instagram without needing a phone in between.\n\n**Related:**[Google Pixel 3 vs iPhone XS: which smartphone has the best\ncamera?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-pixel-3-vs-iphone-xs-\ncamera-3610139)\n\nUnlike dedicated cameras, the YN450 also features a front-facing, 8-megapixel\ncamera for shooting quick selfies. And Yongnuo’s [Facebook\npost](https://www.facebook.com/hkyongnuo/photos/a.335615296586611/1177129062435226/?type=3&__tn__=-R)\nalso says the camera will support Canon EF lenses, which makes it an even more\nunusual combination of sensor, mount and operating system.\n\nElsewhere, you get similar specs to a mid-range Android phone, with a five-\ninch 1080p screen, GPS and 32GB of internal storage (which you can expand by\nanother 32GB).\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nAnd that YN450 name is only a placeholder for now – Yongnuo is holding a\ncompetition on that Facebook page that asks fans to come up with a name for\nthe camera.
