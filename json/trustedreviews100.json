Developed by Crystal Dynamics – the very same\nteam responsible for the excellent Tomb Raider reboot – it has the potential\nto be something truly superb.\n\n**Related:[Nintendo Switch Review](https://www.trustedreviews.com/nintendo-\nswitch-review)**  \n  \n_We’ve compiled all the latest news on The Avengers Square Enix Project\nincluding all the new announcements, trailers and everything we’d love to\nsee._\n\n## The Avengers Square Enix Project at a glance\n\n**When does The Avengers come out?** _2018 at the earliest_\n\n**What’s new about The Avengers?** _Announcement teaser trailer_\n\n**_How much will it cost?_** _To be confirmed_\n\n## The Avengers Square Enix Project – What is it?\n\nDeveloped by Crystal Dynamics in collaboration with Eidos Montreal, this new\nadventure takes place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It will, presumably,\nstar the same mixture of heroes found in the super popular films. Whether it\nwill serve a narrative purpose alongside them remains to be seen, but you can\nexpect an abundance of nerdy references and homages along the way.\n\n![marvel](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n## The Avengers Square Enix Project release date – When is it coming out?\n\nNot for a while. Square confirmed in a press release alongside the\nannouncement trailer that more news would be shared in 2018 with other Marvel\nprojects.\n\n“The Avengers project is being designed for gamers worldwide and will be\npacked with all the characters, environments, and iconic moments that have\nthrilled longtime fans of the franchise. Featuring a completely original\nstory, it will introduce a universe gamers can play in for years to come. More\ndetails on The Avengers project and other games will be announced in 2018.”  \n  \nSquare Enix and Marvel have a habit of announcing projects long before their\nrelease, so this is no surprise.\n\n## The Avengers Square Enix Project trailer – How does it look?\n\nThe aforementioned announcement trailer is the only snippet of footage we\nhave, and we doubt it represents any form of actual gameplay.\n\nDespite its brevity, the trailer teases some exciting ideas, as well as the\nappearance of our favourite superheroes. Recognisable mementos of The Hulk,\nIron Man, Captain America and Thor all feature, and we’ll be damned if you\ndidn’t get goosebumps.\n\n## The Avengers Square Enix Project wishlist – What we’d like to see\n\n**![Marvel Avengers\nAssemble](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)**\n\nDifferent playstyles\n\nThe debut trailer confirms the appearance of multiple heroes, all of which\npossess their own unique powers and abilities. So, does this mean each of them\nwill handle differently, requiring a certain amount of tact and skill to\nmaster? Fingers crossed, as this sense of variety is something we rarely see\nin AAA action titles. Having the option to navigate the environment with Iron\nMan’s suit or Thor’s mythic hammer sounds thrilling, as does sprinting through\nthe streets as Captain America while he chases after some bad guys. Now we’re\ngetting flashbacks of [The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate\nDestruction](https://www.trustedreviews.com/Incredible-Hulk-Ultimate-\nDestruction-review) on PS2.\n\n**A gaming universe**\n\nEver since the release of Robert Downey Jr’s Iron Man in 2008 we’ve seen\nMarvel craft a multi-faceted cinematic universe previously thought impossible.\nAs far we know, this project will take place in the very same world, but\nimagine if it didn’t. Imagine if Marvel gave Square Enix the freedom to craft\nits own canonical setting using the foundations so many films have built. It’d\nmake perfect sense to leave the staple of heroes untouched, yet we could\ncertainly see the introduction of villains absent from the big screen, drawing\nfrom decades of comic history. It would also make it far easier for newcomers\nto follow along.\n\n**Plenty of iconic locations**\n\nWe’re indifferent about the inclusion of an open-world, as we’d be just as\nhappy riding through a linear blockbuster experience filled with wonderfully\nrendered environments. Think of it as Uncharted or Tomb Raider meets Batman:\nArkham Asylum. Having the S.H.I.E.L.D helicarrier acting as a base of\noperations before The Avengers set out on missions would be brilliant,\nespecially if you had the option to converse with each character. Forming a\ndeeper relationship that could always have important ramifications on your\nabilities or the wider narrative. Either way, we cannot wait to see the world\nof Marvel translated into gaming form once again.\n\n_**What would you like see from The Avengers Square Enix Project?
