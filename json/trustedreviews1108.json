This time taking place in Brooklyn, the\nkeynote saw the arrival of new iPad Pros and a [new MacBook\nAir](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/new-macbook-air-2018-release-\ndate-3433474).\n\nApple last updated its iPads Pros in June 2017, giving them 120Hz displays and\nslicker designs. That’s a long time ago in tech so it’s nice to see new iPad\nPros appear ahead of the Christmas rush.\n\nBut should you be getting ready to swap your [2017 iPad\nPro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/ipad-pro) for the [iPad Pro\n2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ipad-pro-2018-release-date-specs-\nprice-3482812)? Let’s take a look and see what’s new.\n\n## **iPad Pro 2018 vs iPad Pro 2017 – A big redesign**\n\nThe 2018 iPad Pro is one of the biggest redesigns in the Apple tablet’s\nhistory, thinning the bezel surrounding the display and rounding off the edges\na bit more.\n\n**Related:[Best tablets](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-tablets)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nGone is the home button and Touch ID fingerprint sensor, just like on the\nrecent iPhones, replaced by the Face ID facial recognition. Unlike with the\niPhone XS, XS Max and XR though, the Face ID system here works both in\nportrait and landscape orientation.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Mi Mix 3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Xiaomi Mi Mix 3 UK release teased in plain sight by Three\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/xiaomi-mi-mix-3-uk-release-date-price-\nspecs-3610596 \"Xiaomi Mi Mix 3 UK release teased in plain sight by Three\")\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Bang & Olufsen announces Bronze Collection of multiroom speakers\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/bo-bronze-collection-3613043 \"Bang &\nOlufsen announces Bronze Collection of multiroom speakers\")\n\n  *   * [ ![OnePlus 6T head on](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### The OnePlus 6T might soon be available from Three\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/three-uk-oneplus-3613430 \"The OnePlus 6T\nmight soon be available from Three\")\n\n  * \n\nEven though Face ID makes it debut on an iPad, there’s no notch jutting into\nthe display here. Instead Apple clearly has enough room in the remaining bezel\nto fit in the required camera, flood illuminator and IR sensors.\n\nAside from unlocking the new iPad Pro, the sensors used for Face ID also\nenable Animoji and Memoji in iMessage. These are augmented reality emojis that\nturn your facial animations into things like dinosaurs and pigs.\n\nOther big changes to the design include a switch to USB-C rather than\nLightning and no headphone jack.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSwitching to USB-C is a massive boon. It’s the first time Apple has used the\nconnectivity on any of its iOS devices. Not only does USB-C mean you’ll be\nable to charge the new iPad Pro with the same plug and cable as a MacBook (or\nany number of Android phones) but it’ll also let you output 4K video and use\nit as an output device for charging other things. Hopefully we’ll see this\ncome to iPhones next year.\n\nAfter Apple ditched the headphone jack on the iPhones a couple of years back\nit was only a matter of time before before it was axed from the iPad too. The\n3.5mm survived the cull on the iPad Pro 2017, but for the 2018 iPad Pro you’ll\nhave to make do with a 3.5mm adaptor or Bluetooth.\n\nMagnets now sit around the iPad Pro and this lets you attach the new Apple\nPencil 2 and new Folio Smart Keyboard. Previously you’d have to plug the\nPencil into the Lightning port and attach the keyboard via the Smart Connector\n– which now seems to have been killed completely.\n\n## **iPad Pro 2018 vs iPad Pro 2017 – New screen sizes**\n\nLast year’s iPad Pro came in two sizes: 10.5-inch and 12.9-inch. However\nthings are a little different here.\n\nThe 10.5-inch model has been replaced with an 11-inch model that has the same\nfootprint as the outgoing model. The 12.9-inch model remains, but it’s now in\na smaller body. Apple said the new iPad Pro 12.9-inch ‘has 25% less volume\nthan before’.\n\nBoth the 2018 and 2017 iPad Pros feature a 120Hz refresh rate on the display\n(Apple calls this ProMotion), along with wide DCI-P3 colour. Support for HDR\ncontent was not mentioned.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nLCD remains the screen type choice for the new iPad Pro and Apple is using the\nsame ‘Liquid Retina’ moniker first introduced with the iPhone XR. Like the XR,\nthe iPad Pro 2018 uses anti-aliasing and pixel-mapping to ensure the curved\ncorners of the display are accurately represented.\n\n## **iPad Pro 2018 vs iPad Pro 2017 – Lots of internal changes**\n\nPowering the iPad Pro 2018 is a variation of the [A12\nBionic](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-a12-bionic-3462239) chip\nyou’ll find in the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max and iPhone XR. It’s called the\nA12X Bionic and it has been constructed with a 7nm architecture for improved\nefficiency and performance. Apple said its new chips have 10 billion\ntransistors, offer 35% better single-core and 90% better multi-core\nperformance.\n\nWhat makes this chip special for the iPad is a new graphics chip that’ll help\nthe tablet appeal to creative professionals and those looking at turning the\niPad into their main computer. The A12X Bionic offers 2x the performance of\nthe A10X and Apple said it can offer similar graphics to an Xbox One S.\n\nAs is typical with Apple there was no mention of the amount of RAM.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nInside the iPad Pro 2017 the grunt is provided by the A10X chip (alongside the\nM10 coprocessor) and that is paired with 4GB RAM. We’ve been using the iPad\nPro 10.5 2017 on a daily basis since launch and to this day it still stands up\nas a very fast device that’ll comfortably handle anything that can be thrown\nat it.\n\nFour speakers sit around the device, just like they did on the 2017 iPad Pro.\nHowever now they offer wide stereo audio and include both a tweeter and a\nwoofer.\n\n## **iPad Pro 2018 vs iPad Pro 2017 – How much do they cost?**\n\nDon’t expect them to come cheap though. At the time of publication, the\n[10.5-inch iPad Pro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/ipad-pro) starts\nat $649/£619 and the [12.9-inch iPad\nPro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/ipad-pro-12-9-inch) model (both of\nwhich came out in June 2017) begins at $799/£769.\n\nFor the iPad Pro 2018 the 11-inch version starts at $799/£769 for 64GB. 256GB,\n512GB and 1TB options are available too. The same storage options are\navailable for the 12.9-inch version, however that model’s price starts at\n$999/£969.\n\n**Buy now:[iPad Pro 2018 from £769 from\nApple](https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-pro)**\n\n_**Stay tuned to Trusted Reviews for full reviews of the new iPad Pro in the\ncoming weeks.**_\n\n"}
