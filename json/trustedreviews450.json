With that custom coil architecture, custom chipset, tweaked versionof iOS, custom power management and the simple fact that it’s a first-partyApple accessory, it’s unlikely to sit beneath the £100/$100 mark.Apple currently offers the likes of Belkin’s Boost Up wireless charging padfor around £60/$60, but that’s a standard 7.5W single-pad charger. [Earlyreports](http://www.chongdiantou.com/wp/archives/26814.html) suggest that theAirPower mat will cost closer to $150/£130.**Are you excited about Apple AirPower?
