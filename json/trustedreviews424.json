It’s not as sharp asthe [HTC U11](https://www.trustedreviews.com/htc-u11-review), nor is it assharp as a 5-inch 1080p device, but colours are nice and because it’s AMOLEDthere’s that extra depth to blacks that you don’t get with LCD.Gorilla Glass 5 covers the panel and that should help prevent scratches, but Ihave still found small hairline scratches appear on the display after a weekof use.[ Next  Performance and Software](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/oneplus-5-performance-and-software-page-2)"}
