But upon closer inspection you’ll spot a few subtle, but positive,\nchanges.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nFor starters, Dell has managed to reduce the already minuscule 5.6mm bezel\naround last year’s display to a meagre 4mm on the new XPS 13. It’s also moved\nthe webcam to sit centrally below the screen.\n\nThe placement doesn’t stop the webcam generally giving people a lovely shot of\nyour nasal passages during video calls, but it does at least make you\ncentrally framed, which is a minor improvement. Personally, I’d have also\nliked it if Dell had bump up the camera’s max resolution to 1080p, like the\nSurface Book’s, but using the XPS 13 as my main work laptop I didn’t have any\nhuge issues with its max 720p resolution.\n\nUp close you’ll see Dell has surrounded the keyboard and trackpad with a new\nwoven glass-fibre finish. I wasn’t the biggest fan of the new white and gold\nversion I tested, but some other reviewers swooned over it – each to their\nown, I guess. Either way, the material feels well made and proved to be\nsuitably scratch-resistant.\n\n**Related:[Best laptops](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nlaptops-3431966)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nBuild quality also remains excellent. It felt suitably rugged and easily\nsurvived being lugged around London in my satchel for a week without picking\nup a single blemish. The laptop’s 1.21kg weight also means it’s lightweight to\nuse on the go.\n\nMy only minor quibble with the design is that Dell has dropped the previous\nmodel’s full-sized USB 3.1 ports, replacing them with USB-C inputs.\nSpecifically, you get two Thunderbolt inputs, a basic USB-C 3.1, a 3.5mm jack\nsocket, and a microSD port. The XPS 13 does come with a USB-C-to-USB 3.0\ndongle, but the lack of a full-sized socket is a little annoying if you\nregularly swap out peripherals. Photographers will definitely miss having a\nfull-fat SD card slot.\n\n## Dell XPS 13 – Keyboard and trackpad\n\nDell has also worked to make some subtle improvements to the keyboard and\ntrackpad. Specifically, the layout is a little more spaced out – although\nunless you place it side by side with last year’s model, you’re unlikely to\nnotice a significant difference. However, the slightly more spacious keyboard\nis definitely more comfortable to type on, aided by the new, softer palm\nwrest.\n\nTravel of the backlit chiclet keys isn’t the deepest you’ll find, but the keys\noffer decent feedback and have a nice tactile feel, which makes for an above-\naverage typing experience that’s only beaten by the MacBook Pro. The MacBook\nfeatures a custom Butterfly 2 keyboard which, although noisier, offers one of\nthe best typing experiences you’ll find on any laptop.\n\nThe glass-coated touchpad isn’t as big as that of the Macbook Pro, but it’s\nabout as large as Dell could make it considering the XPS 13’s dinky\ndimensions.\n\nIt’s one of the best you’ll find on a Windows laptop and is a close second to\nthe MacBook Pro’s, which remains the best on the market. It’s wonderfully\nresponsive and uniformly picks up multi-touch commands without\nissue.![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Dell XPS 13 – Display and audio\n\nThe new XPS screen has been completely revamped, with Dell now offering a 4K\nIGZO touch option. Sadly, I only got the chance to review the basic 13.3-inch\nFHD (1920 x 1080) InfinityEdge non-touch version, which from my testing seems\nto be pretty similar to its predecessor.\n\nTo the naked eye, the screen is a delight. The panel is pleasingly free of\nbacklight bleed, is super-bright, and in general, colours look nicely vibrant\nwithout being overcooked.\n\nThe colorimeter screen readings matched my initial impressions. The\n0.2691cd/m2 black level and 409.38cd/m2 white level add up to give the screen\nan excellent 1521:1 contrast ratio. The 6997K colour temperature is a smidgen\ncool compared to the 6500K ideal, but not to the point that many people will\nnotice. All in all, you won’t have any issue using the screen for office work\nor streaming video.\n\nThe InfinityEdge’s only downfall remains its creative colour gamut coverage.\nThe 90% sRGB coverage is great for normal users, but the 65% Adobe RGB and\n68.8% DCI-P3 won’t be good enough for photographers, videographers or artists\nwho physically print their work.\n\nIt’s also a step behind the 13-inch MacBook Pro’s, which covers 98.3% of the\nDCI-P3 gamut and 81.9% of Adobe RGB. Colour gamut coverage is important for\ncreatives, as it helps inform how accurate the colours are on-screen. It gives\na better representation of how the finished product will look when printed or\nshown on a cinema screen.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nDell has also boosted the XPS 13’s audio capabilities by doubling the number\nof speakers from two to four. The speakers aren’t a replacement for a proper\nsound system and, as with every laptop, you won’t want to use them to listen\nto music for prolonged periods. Nevertheless, they’re excellent for watching\nmovies.\n\nSitting directly in front of the laptop, the speakers are powerful and offer a\nsurprisingly chunky low end. Highs and mids are also reasonably well handled\nand avoid sibilance, even when watching movies at high volumes. Rumbling\nengines in movies sound meaty, and gunfire is nicely attacking.\n\n**Related:[Best Ultrabooks](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nultrabook)**\n\n## Dell XPS 13 – Performance\n\nWhen it comes to performance, the big change in the new XPS is the move to\nIntel’s 8th-gen mobile processors, which according to Dell will offer up to\n44% better performance. When buying the XPS you can currently pick between a\nCore i5 or i7, various RAM options and a multitude of different storage\nconfigurations. You can see a full list of the various options in the table\nbelow.\n\n**CPU** |  8th-gen Intel i5-8250U\n\n8th-gen Intel i7-8550U  \n  \n---|---  \n**Graphics** |  Intel UHD Graphics 620  \n**RAM** |  LPDDR3 4-8GB Dual Channel SDRAM at 1866MHz\n\nLPDDR3 16GB Dual Channel SDRAM at 2133MHz  \n  \n**Storage** |  128GB SATA\n\n256GB PCIe\n\n512GB PCIe\n\n1TB PCIe SSD  \n  \n**Display** |  13.3-inch 4K (3840 x 2160) InfinityEdge touch display\n\n13.3-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) InfinityEdge touch display\n\n13.3-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) InfinityEdge non-touch  \n  \n**Connectivity** |  2 x Thunderbolt 3 with PowerShare\n\nDC-In & DisplayPort\n\n1 x USB-C 3.1 with PowerShare DC-In & DisplayPort\n\nmicroSD card reader\n\nHeadset jack\n\nNoble lock slot  \n  \n**Dimensions** |  Height: 7.8 -11.6 mm\n\nWidth: 302 mm\n\nDepth: 199 mm  \n  \n**Weight** |  Starting at 1.21 kg  \n**OS** |  Windows 10 Pro\n\nWindows 10 Home\n\nUbuntu 16.04  \n  \nPerformance between each configuration will vary hugely. The model I tested\nfeatured a Core i7 CPU, 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. This combination of parts\nis impressive, and my only real issue is Dell’s decision once again to add an\nIntel Iris Graphics option. Whichever configuration you pick, you’ll be\nlimited to Intel UHD Graphics 620.\n\nThis won’t be an issue for regular users, but it does mean the laptop\nstruggles with demanding processes, such as large-scale 3D modelling in ZBrush\nor 4K video editing.\n\nConsidering the laptop’s focus size and the screen’s gamut coverage, this is\nfar from a deal-breaker, especially considering the XPS 13’s impressive\nbenchmark scores.\n\nYou can see how the XPS 13 compares to the equivalently specced i7 versions of\nthe [Surface Book 2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/surface-book-2),\n[Surface Pro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/surface-pro) and MacBook\nPro in the table below.\n\n**_Editor’s note:_** _We used a different set of benchmarks when the MacBook\nPro was reviewed, which is why there’s not a comparison here. We’ll update\nthis review when we retest the MacBook._\n\n**Device** | **Geekbench single-core** | **Geekbench multi-core** | **PCMark\n8** | **3DMark FireStrike** | **CrystalDiskMark read** | **CrystalDiskMark\nwrite**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n**XPS 13** |  4676 | 15262  | 3542 | 1192 |  3039.6MB/s |  483.2MB/s  \n**Surface Book 2** |  4488 |  13724 | 2878 |  5124 | 2946MB/s | 1252MB/sec  \n**Surface Pro** |  4603 |  9300 | 2778 | N/A | 1670MB/s  | 915MB/sec  \n  \nThe generalist Geekbench and PCMark scores are excellent for a laptop without\na dGPU. The only performance blip is the SSD write score, which is\ninexplicably lower than expected. This, again, will be an issue for video\neditors.\n\nWith real-world use the XPS 13 performs amazingly well. I’m yet to have any\nissue using the laptop as my primary work and play device.\n\nThe Dell also handled small digital painting work with ease, with a Wacom\nIntuos graphics tablet attached. 3D work in Blender put a bigger strain on the\ndevice, and it did begin to struggle when working on bigger projects – but\nthat’s hardly surprising on a laptop with Intel HD graphics.\n\nThe same is true with gaming. If you buy the XPS 13 then don’t expect to be\nable to play anything other than old, or low-power, indie titles.\n\nHeat and noise are excellent, no matter the task at hand. This is largely\nthanks to the XPS 13’s reworked cooling system. The laptop use GOR technology\ncooling tech, which places a layer of gel insulation across fans and heatpipes\nto improve cooling.\n\nThe system worked a treat during testing and meant the laptop never became\nuncomfortably hot – although when I really pushed it in Blender, minor fan\nnoise did begin to creep in.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Dell XPS 13 – Battery life\n\nDell claims the XPS 13 will offer up an astonishing 19hrs 46mins of use. This\nis the sort of battery life you’d expect from a tablet with a mobile\nprocessor, not an i5- or i7-powered Windows 10 PC.\n\nRunning Trusted Reviews’ synthetic battery-burn test – which involves looping\n10 minutes of web browsing and five minutes of video playback with the screen\nset to 150 nits – the XPS 13 didn’t match Dell’s claim, but it still performed\nadmirably.\n\nThe laptop managed an average of 12-13 hours through the three battery tests,\nwhich is above average for a laptop with the XPS’s specs.\n\nWith real-world use the XPS 13’s battery performance mirrored its benchmark\nscore. Using it as my primary work and personal laptop, it usually lasted a\nfull day with regular use.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Why buy the Dell XPS 13?\n\nIf you’re after an excellent all-round Windows 10 Ultrabook then you’ll\nstruggle to do better than the XPS 13. It doesn’t present a huge step forward\non 2017’s model, but the changes that Dell has made are uniformly positive.\n\nThe only slight downside is that Dell still hasn’t addressed its two biggest\nissues: the lack of better graphics options, and slightly lacklustre coverage\nof the creative colour gamuts.\n\nHowever, these omissions are forgivable given the XPS 13’s £740 starting\nprice, which makes it significantly cheaper than its arch-rival, the MacBook\nPro, whose basic configuration retails for over £1000.\n\n## Verdict\n\nThe XPS 13 is the best all-round, small-form-factor Windows 10 laptop you can\nbuy, but it isn’t quite perfect.\n\n## Score\n\n  \n\n"}
