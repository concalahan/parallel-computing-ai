But when it comes to proper creative work, you can’t beat the\nprecision offered by a dedicated stylus — and the[Apple\nPencil](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/apple-pencil-vs-wacom-vs-\nsurface-pen-vs-s-pen-2928575) is Apple’s offering to artists. **\n\nIs the Apple Pencil starting to look a little old in 2018? First released in\n2015, the hardware is almost two-and-a-half years old now, and predates newer\nApple technologies like [Face ID](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/what-is-\nface-id-3286453).\n\nThe time is therefore ripe for Apple to launch a follow-up – we’ll call it the\nApple Pencil 2 – so we’ve collected together all of the latest leaks and\nrumours to try and work out what the tech giant has planned. Here’s everything\nwe think we know, including the Apple Pencil 2 release date, price, and hints\nand the new features we might see.\n\nShall we begin?\n\n**Related:[WWDC 2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/wwdc-2018-dates-\nrumors-news-3399519)**\n\n## Apple Pencil 2 release date and price\n\nAlthough Apple is yet to announce the Apple Pencil 2, at present the most\nlikely dates for its reveal are June, or September in 2018. Apple likes to\nannounce its products with a release following pretty quickly afterwards,\nusually within a month or so.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nOur initial prediction was for a March announcement at an [education-focussed\nevent](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-event-\nmarch-2018-launch-3433358) that Apple held on March 27. As well as the hand-\ndrawn look of the event’s logo, rumours pointed towards there being some kind\nof Apple Pencil announcement coming out of the event alongside the event’s\n[new 2018 iPads.](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/new-ipad-2018-release-\ndate-specs-price-rumours-leaks-3423309)\n\nHowever, in the end all we got was the announcement that the existing Apple\nPencil would work on the new iPad.\n\nThat means that at this point a WWDC or even a September reveal alongside the\n[iPhone 9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-9-release-date-specs-\nfeatures-price-rumours-uk-3297160) are now the main options for Apple Pencil\n2’s reveal — if its coming in 2018 at all.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Apple Pencil 2 rumoured features\n\nWith the new Apple Pencil yet to see an official announcement, details are\ncurrently thin on the ground as to what direction Apple might want to take the\nhardware in. Most of what we have to go on currently are patents, which are a\nvague indication at best.\n\nThe firmest (yet probably least exciting) rumour doing the rounds is that the\nnew Pencil will be [equipped\nwith](https://www.letemsvetemapplem.eu/2017/01/18/apple-pencil-2-prvni-\ninformace-patent/) some kind of physical or magnetic clip for more easily\nattaching it to an iPad.\n\nHowever, we’re more excited by the prospect of the Pencil’s tip getting a\nredesign. The rumour comes courtesy of [a\npatent](http://www.google.com/patents/US9329703) that suggests interchangeable\nnibs might allow artists to pick a size and shape of nib that works best for\nthem.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCombine this with [rumours](http://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-\napple/2017/02/apple-wins-patent-for-next-gen-force-sensors-for-apple-pencil-\nthat-could-control-zoom-scrolling-and-more.html) that the new Pencil might be\nforce sensitive (much as every iPhone since the 6S has been), and it’s\nstarting to sound like the Apple Pencil 2 might more closely resemble the\nstyluses that typically accompany dedicated creative pro tablets.\n\nOther patents have also [hinted that](http://www.google.com/patents/US9329703)\nthe end of the Pencil 2 might be equipped with an eraser to easily scrub out\nany mistakes.\n\nFinally, and perhaps most intriguingly, are\n[rumours](http://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2018/02/apple-patent-\nreveals-advancing-apple-pencil-to-work-with-non-touch-surfaces-and-\nsupporting-3d-ar-editing-apps.html) that the Apple Pencil 2 might be equipped\nwith technology to allow it to write on any surface — rather than just a\ntouchscreen. This functionality would not only be helpful for using the iPad\non a desk, but could also allow the Pencil 2 to be used like a mouse to\ncontrol a Mac.\n\n## Apple Pencil 2: What we want to see\n\nThe biggest omission from any of these rumours has been any mention of a\nspring-loaded tip.\n\nThe Apple Pencil is a solid piece of plastic, so actually drawing with it can\nsometimes feel like using a crayon rather than a pen. Competing styluses from\nWacom get around this problem by having a nib with a spring in it which flexes\nas you press on the screen, leading to a much more natural feeling drawing\nexperience.\n\nWe’d also really like to see the Pencil equipped with a side button for\nenabling shortcuts — be that changing colours or drawing modes. Again, this is\nsomething that’s fairly common with other styluses.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nFinally, we’d just like to see the Apple Pencil 2 be made more ergonomic. Past\nApple products such as the\n[AirPods](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/airpods) have done a great\njob at combining ergonomics with the trademark sleek Apple design, but we\nthink the original Apple Pencil leans far too much towards the latter.\n\nIt ends up meaning that the Pencil is uncomfortable to use for drawing over\nlonger periods. We’d love a slightly thicker pencil, perhaps with a little\nrubber to cushion the fingers.\n\n**What would you like to see the next Apple Pencil do? Let us know\n@TrustedReviews**\n\n"}
