While that division brought in $1.7 billion\nlast quarter, it made $2.64 billion during the last three months.\n\nFrom this, we can assume the Apple Watch grossed around (or perhaps more than)\na billion dollars using the period.\n\nIn a statement Tim Cook said the Apple Watch had enjoyed a great start, but\ndid not wouldn’t back it up with the numbers.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n“We had an amazing quarter, with iPhone revenue up 59 percent over last year,\nstrong sales of Mac, all-time record revenue from services, driven by the App\nStore, and a great start for Apple Watch,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook.\n\n“The excitement for Apple Music has been incredible, and we’re looking forward\nto releasing iOS 9, OS X El Capitan and watchOS 2 to customers in the fall.”\n\n**Related:[Apple Watch 2 release\ndate](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-watch-2-release-date-rumours-\nprice-news-battery-life)**\n\nAlthough the omission of Apple Watch sales was expected, it will fuel\nspeculation the smartwatch has not performed as well as anticipated,\nespecially since the early pre-order surge.\n\nReports over the last couple of weeks claimed sales have fallen by 90 per cent\nsince the first week, with Apple only shifting around [5,000-a-day in the US\nin recent weeks](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-watch-sales-\nreportedly-plunge).\n\nApple is said to have ‘competitive reasons’ for not disclosing the figures,\nbut it’s not clear how the smartwatch sales are any different to the other\nsectors where Apple has competition and still releases the sales figures.\n\nIn terms of earnings, it was another big quarter for Cupertino with revenue of\n$49.6 billion, of which $10.7 billion was net income. Profits were up by 38\nper cent on the $7.7 billion it made one year ago.\n\n"}
