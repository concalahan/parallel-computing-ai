device, changing Samsungâs focus and\nshifting to a better design outlook. It laid the groundwork for the fantastic\nS7 and possibly the upcoming[Samsung Galaxy\nS8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s8-release-date-specs-\nrumours-price-uk)._\n\nSamsung will also update the S6 to [Android 7.0\nNougat](https://www.trustedreviews.com/android-7-0-nougat-review) in the\ncoming months, giving your phone a new lease of life. Considering it still has\na great screen and camera, thereâs still a lot to like about this phone. Read\non for our original full review.\n\n## What is the Samsung Galaxy S6?\n\nOne of the finest phones of the year, we recently gave the Samsung Galaxy S6 â\nand its curvier S6 Edge cousin â the [Trusted Reviews Smartphone of the Year\naward](https://www.trustedreviews.com/trustedreviews-awards-2015/vote).\n\nThanks to a more affordable price, the S6 is still one of the best Android\nphones you can buy right now. Itâs got a sharp screen, stunning camera, slick\nbuild and itâs a lot more compact than most other similarly specced phones on\nthe market.\n\nIf the [S6 Edge+](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-s6-edge-plus-\nreview) is simply too big for you and youâre not keen on going over to IOS\nwith the [iPhone 6S](https://www.trustedreviews.com/iphone-6s-review), the\nGalaxy S6 is a great choice.\n\n**VIDEO: Galaxy S6 vs iPhone 6 vs HTC One M9 group test**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Google Home Hub YouTube](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n###  Will Google Home Hub ever get Netflix?

The Galaxy S6\nEdge is arguably the more stylish of the two, but you only need to spend more\nfor it if you really want to. Smooth Gorilla Glass 4 front and rear, and\naluminium alloy bands on the sides, means looks and feels like flagship phone.\nUnlike last yearâs S5, the S6 feels like itâs worth over Â£500/$684.99. Thatâs\nimportant.  \n **  \nRelated:[Best Smartphones and Mobile\nPhones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-smartphone_round-up)**\n\n![S6\ncolours](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \nLess successful are some of the colour options, though. The âjewel tonesâ â as\nSamsung calls them â include White Pearl, Gold Platinum, Black Sapphire, Blue\nTopaz and Green Emerald. The brighter colours also tend to be fingerprint\nmagnets so keep a spare cloth handy if you opt for one of those.\n\nSome finishes have a slight dual tonality to them, so they appear to change\ncolour depending on how the light shines on them. The effect is more subtle\nthan the pink/gold combo on the [HTC M9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/htc-\none-m9-review), but it can still look a little tacky, particularly in Blue\nTopaz and Gold Platinum.\n\n**Related:[Samsung Galaxy S6 vs Galaxy S5 Specs\nComparison](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/galaxy-s6-vs-galaxy-s5)**\n\n![Samsung Galaxy S6 pics\n9](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nThe phone is light but still feels solid, and itâs slimmer than the Galaxy S5.\nIn fact, despite its large 5.1-inch screen, it doesnât feel that much chunkier\nor clumsier than the dinky, 4-inch iPhone 5S. Thin metal volume and power keys\nlive on opposite sides, which helps avoid accidentally pressing power key as\nwe experienced with the HTC One M9.  \n **  \n**One move that doesnât work so well is the speaker placement. It now sits\nawkwardly at the base of the phone, rather than the back as it did on the\nGalaxy S5. Neither placement is particularly helpful, as theyâre easy to block\nwhen held normally. This muffles the sound in the natural way youâd hold it\nwhile playing a game or watching a movie. Another issue is that the home key\nis slightly raised, making it easy to press accidentally while itâs in your\npocket.\n\n**Related:[Samsung Galaxy S6 Tips and\nTricks](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/samsung-galaxy-s6-tips-and-\ntricks)**\n\n![Samsung Galaxy S6 pics\n3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)  \n_The S6 and S5 look very similar from the front_\n\nThe rear of the phone is a less of a design success. The camera protrudes\naround 2mm making it look a little like a break-out on the face of an\nunfortunate teenager. Some people will be bothered less than others but the\nkey point is that it slides in and out of your pocket easily thanks to sloped\nedges. The SIM-tray sits flush with the side and if you can keep hold of the\nannoyingly elusive SIM-ejector tool or use a paperclip, the tray pops out\nfirmly without too much difficulty.\n\nThere are a couple more genuine drawbacks to the spanking new Galaxy S6âs\ndesign, though. Glass may be easy to grip but itâs so super smooth that the S6\ndives off many surfaces like Michael Phelps at the first hint of a starting\nwhistle â weâve caught the S6 on the edge of possible destruction on numerous\noccasions during our time reviewing it. ****\n\nUsing a case or resting the phone on a textured surface reduces the frequency\nof these suicide dives, but a less slippery finish might have been better.\nItâs swings and roundabouts though. We prefer the look of the Glass-backed\nGalaxy S6 but felt safer with the S5âs grippy, dimpled back.\n\nThe S6 isnât waterproof like the Galaxy S5, so you need to take more care than\nbefore. Mind you, weâll be surprised if Samsung doesnât release an IP-rated\nGalaxy S6 âActiveâ variant in the coming weeks or months.\n\n**Related:[Best Samsung Galaxy S6 cases](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-\nsamsung-galaxy-s6-cases_round-up)**\n\n## Samsung Galaxy S6 â Screen\n\n_5.1-inch; 1440 x 2560 pixels (QHD or 2K); 577ppi; Super AMOLED; Gorilla Glass\n4_\n\nThe 5.1-inch screen on the Samsung Galaxy S6 is truly brilliant and definitely\none of the best screens weâve seen on a mobile phone. Only the [LG\nG4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/lg-g3-review) and [Galaxy Note\n4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-note-4-review) can match it\nfor sharpness, but the Super AMOLED panel on the S6 is cut above in every\nother respect.\n\nCompared to most LCD-screened phones the Galaxy S6âs screen is more vibrant,\nthough Full HD (1080p) screens look just as sharp unless you start looking at\nthe screen from a couple of inches away. The S5âs screen is just as vibrant as\nthe S6, but the S6 produces cleaner, more natural whites. Whites look slightly\nblue on the S5, while the S6 looks closer to the iPhone 6, which is the best\nin this department.\n\n**Related:[Samsung Galaxy S6 vs S6\nEdge](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/samsung-galaxy-s6-vs-s6-edge)**\n\n![S6 pixel\ncomparison](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \n_The S6 vs the S5 pixel density  \n_  \nBut thereâs no doubting which has the best contrast. AMOLED screens donât have\na traditional backlight, which means blacks appear perfectly black. This means\nvideos and photos look fantastic, while the punchier colours outshine the\niPhone 6 as well. It looks great indoors and holds up well even in direct\nsunlight.\n\n**Read also:[OLED VS LCD](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/oled-vs-led-\nlcd)**\n\nSamsungâs TouchWiz UI allows you to adjust the display colours to fit the\nuserâs preferences, and we found that the AMOLED Photo setting produced the\nmost colour faithful results without heavily sacrificing vibrancy. Appleâs\niPhone 6 is the benchmark for colour accuracy but the Galaxy S6 is closer to\nthe iPhone than any other phone weâve seen.\n\n**SEE ALSO:[](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/samsung-\ngalaxy-s4-vs-s6-vs-s5)[Samsung Galaxy S4 VS S5 VS\nS6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/samsung-galaxy-s4-vs-s6-vs-s5):\nWhich is the right upgrade for you?**\n\n![Samsung Galaxy S6 pics\n15](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \n**Related:[Best Mobile Deals: Top Smartphone offers this\nmonth](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/best-phone-deals)**\n\nThe screen looks good from every viewing angle, too, making it perfect for\nsharing videos and photos on.
