Here to help, we’ve summarised everything you need to know about\nNvidia’s new behemoth monitors, including our hands-on impressions.\n\n## What are Nvidia BFGD (big format gaming displays)?\n\nBFGD are a new standard of monitor from Nvidia. They aim to combine the perks\nof both top-end TVs and gaming monitors into a custom 65-inch panel built by\nthe company in partnership with AU Optronics. Any monitor carrying the BFGD\nbranding will offer a variety of different technologies.\n\nFor starters, they’ll have to offer the razor-sharp 4K resolutions seen on\nexpensive TVs, while also meeting the HDR10 (High Dynamic Range 10) standard.\nThis means the panel will have to reach a minimum brightness of 1000 nits.\nConsidering the fact they’re LCD – not OLED – panels, this will be a seriously\nimpressive achievement if Nvidia succeeds and manages to maintain a decent\nblack level. The panels will also present a super-fast 120Hz refresh rate,\nfull coverage of the DCI-P3 colour gamut and support Nvidia’s G-Sync variable-\nrefresh-rate technology.\n\n**Related:[Best gaming monitors](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\ngaming-monitors)**\n\n## What this means for gamers and movie fans\n\nThe combination of technologies means that BFGD monitors will, in theory, be\ngreat for both watching movies and competitive gaming.\n\nHDR10 support isn’t a unique selling point, but it’s awesome nonetheless. HDR\nTVs and monitors aim to make images, games and videos look more dynamic and\nlifelike by offering better contrast and superior brightness levels to their\nnon-high-dynamic-range competitors.

For non-techies, refresh rate refers to the\nnumber of images a screen can render per second. A higher refresh rate means\nthere are fewer gaps between each new animation and image.\n\n**Related:[Monitor refresh rates\nexplained](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/144hz-monitors-refresh-rate-\nmotion-blur-explained-2948180)**\n\nGamers tend to favour a higher refresh rate. If implemented correctly, it\nmakes the screen significantly more responsive and smoother to use. This\nincreased responsiveness also results in the monitors being able to detect and\ndisplay your controller or mouse and keyboard movements faster on-screen – an\nadvantage in reaction-focused games such as first-person shooters.\n\nG-Sync is a nifty technology that’s similar to AMD’s FreeSync. For gamers, the\nbenefits of G-Sync remain the same on BFGD monitors as they are on regular\ngaming displays. The tech syncs the screen’s dynamic refresh rate with the\nGPU, to stop it jumping ahead and pre-rendering images early, thus causing\nscreen tears and anomalies appearing when gaming.\n\nWhat’s unique here is the size of the panel. To date there haven’t been any\nmainstream gaming monitors to match a BFGD monitor in size. The inclusion of\nthe tech is doubly important for those looking for an all-in-one device that\ncan work as a gaming monitor and lounge TV.\n\nThere are some 120Hz TVs on the market, but most remain capped at 60Hz and the\nrefresh rates aren’t variable. A locked refresh rate can affect how some types\nof entertainment media are displayed. TVs generally force movies, which are\nmastered in cinemas at 24Hz, to play at 60Hz, for example.\n\nEven if they have a higher refresh rate, the forced boost can cause a number\nof technical issues, including motion blur and screen tearing. The inclusion\nof G-Sync and variable refresh rates should reduce, or even stop, such\nproblems occuring on BFGDs by letting them manually adjust to play content at\nits native refresh rate.\n\nThe inclusion of an integrated Nvidia Shield further boosts BFGDs’\nentertainment capabilities, giving buyers access to key services including\nNetflix, Amazon Video and YouTube, as well as Android apps and Nvidia’s\nGameStream.\n\nThe end result is a compelling package that could be a great choice for lounge\nPC gamers looking for a slick high-refresh-rate monitor that can double as a\nTV.\n\n**Related:[Best 4K streaming services](https://www.trustedreviews.com/how-\nto/how-to-find-netflix-amazon-hdr-streams-2942413)**\n\nWho’s making them?  \nAcer, Asus and HP will be the first companies to release BFGDs. Sadly, all\nthree have been tight-lipped about the monitors’ exact specifications –\noutside of the fact that units will meet the standards set by Nvidia.\n\n## BFGD release date\n\nSadly, this is another key question yet to be answered. The only hint we have\nso far is that “it’s expected to be later this year”. Helpful.\n\n## Are they any good?\n\n_Hands-on by Max Parker_\n\nCES 2018 hasn’t been jammed with seriously exciting products. There have been\nsome impressive televisions, an excellent addition to Dell’s laptop line in\nthe XPS 15 2-in-1, and Google Assistant in just about everything – but on the\nwhole it’s been an unremarkable show.\n\nThat’s why Nvidia’s fantastic BFGD (Big Format Gaming Displays) stood out so\nmuch when I tried them. For my demo I was shown the BFGD from HP, but the ones\nfrom Asus and Acer were also in the room. All three have the same basic specs\n– HDR10 support, 4K resolution, G-Sync and the Nvidia Shield platform baked in\n– but differ when it comes to inputs, outputs and designs. Acer’s version, for\nexample, had the garish colour scheme and over-the-top looks synonymous with\nits Predator brand.\n\nInitially they’ll all be 65 inches in size, but Nvidia reps teased that\nsmaller models could possibly come out at a later date, which will be a\nblessing for people without oodles of space.  \nThey’re also all LED panels, rather than OLED. Nvidia told me this decision\nwas made to allow the 120Hz refresh rate and G-Sync, but that we might\neventually see some OLED versions when the tech allows.\n\nPlaying games, it was instantly noticeable how gamers will appreciate the\naddition of G-Sync on a monitor this size. In Destiny 2, a game that also\nsupports HDR, everything felt ridiculously smooth and an absolute joy to play.\nG-Sync on such a huge panel is a unique, amazing experience that really needs\nto be seen to be understood.\n\nNvidia was quick to point out that these aren’t televisions – they have no\ntuners inside – but the idea is that they can replace your main TV without any\ntrouble.\n\nEach model will have Nvidia’s excellent Shield TV built in, and they’ll\nreceive the same updates that are pushed out to the regular box. That means\nyou can control your smart home through Google Assistant, download apps from\nGoogle Play and even stream games from Nvidia’s GeForce Now service.\n\nAmazon’s Prime app is pre-installed and I was shown an episode of The Grand\nTour in 4K HDR with G-Sync enabled. G-Sync isn’t just restricted to games, and\noffering variable refresh rates to movies and TV shows is huge. The footage\nlooked excellent, and even though the black levels can’t match those of OLED,\nit didn’t really bother me. Obviously if you’re purely into watching films,\nrather than gaming, you’d still be better off with an OLED.\n\n## How much will a BFGD cost?\n\nThe biggest barrier to entry for these BFGDs will be the price. Nothing has\nbeen confirmed yet, but they’re going to be oh-so expensive. Regular 27-inch\n4K G-Sync enabled monitors can run upwards of £500, so my wallet is already\nworrying about how much I am going to end up shelling out for one of these\nbeauties.\n\n## Variable refresh rate support in HDMI 2.1\n\nThe lack of a solid release date is another potential barrier, since one of\nBFGD’s biggest selling points – variable refresh rates – will appear on\nmainstream TVs when the new HDMI 2.1 standard starts to roll out. HDMI 2.1 was\nfirst announced at CES 2017, but we haven’t seen any TVs sporting the tech hit\nthe market yet.\n\n**Related:[What is HDMI 2.1?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/what-is-\nhdmi-2-1-specs-explained-2948941)**\n\n_**Excited about Nvidia BFGDs?
