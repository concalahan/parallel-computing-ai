However, in 1993 he joked to the Seattle\nTimes: “You might say I’m still waiting for my royalty checks.”\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n> Mario Segale, the namesake of Nintendo’s Mario character, dies at age\n85<https://t.co/vgFVwlfMYp>\n\n>\n\n> This is the first labeled photo of him as an adult on the Internet\n[pic.twitter.com/fm4Do6tikY](https://t.co/fm4Do6tikY)\n\n>\n\n> — Benj Edwards (@benjedwards) [November 1,\n2018](https://twitter.com/benjedwards/status/1057970013171277824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nMario’s first appearance in a video game was as ‘Jumpman’ in the 1981 arcade\ngame Donkey Kong, but the red-suited plumber would go on to star in his own\nfranchise later that decade and become, arguably, the most iconic character in\ngaming history.\n\nKotaku [reports](https://kotaku.com/marios-real-life-namesake-mario-segale-\ndies-at-84-1830154543) the Mario name came from Nintendo’s search for actual\nnames for their characters. The site reports: “Nintendo wanted proper names\nfor the characters, so they named the hero after their landlord and the lady\nPauline after a Nintendo of America employee’s wife.”\n\n**Do you think Mario is gaming’s most iconic character?
