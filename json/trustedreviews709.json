There’s the noise-cancelling\nWH-1000XM3 (the successor to the excellent\n[WH-1000XM2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sony-wh-1000xm2)), and the\nhigher-end MDR-Z7M2 which focus on sound quality over fancy noise cancelling\nfeatures.\n\nWhatever your audio persuasion, Sony hopes to have something to appeal to you.\n\nHere’s everything you need to know about the range.\n\n**Related:[Best headphones 2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nheadphones-3449433)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Sony WH-1000XM3: The noise cancelling ones\n\nProbably the most interesting set of headphones in the range are the Sony\nWH-1000XM3, the successor to the headphones we bestowed with our [‘Headphones\nof the Year’ award at last year’s Trusted Reviews\nawards](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/headphones-of-the-year-2017-sony-\nwireless-trusted-reviews-awards-3325799).\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nEven if Sony were to release the same headphones again we’d be pretty happy,\nbut of course there are some tweaks under the hood to try and convince you to\nmake the upgrade if you’ve already got the XM2s.\n\nTop of the list of improvements is noise-cancelling, which Sony claims is four\ntimes better thanks to a new noise cancelling processor and will even\ncompensate for changes in air pressure if you’re using them on a flight.\n\nThis same chip apparently also includes a 32-bit signal processor, which\nsounds like it might offer some kind of audio upscaling of your audio.\n\nThe WH-1000XM3 will be released at the beginning of September for £330.\n\nRead our first impressions: [Sony\nWH-1000XM3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sony-wh-1000xm3)\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Sony WF-SP900: The sporty true wireless ones\n\nIf you want to listen to your music in the gym rather than the skies, then the\nWF-SP900 might be more to your liking. Their true wireless form-factor means\nthat you’re not going to snag any pesky cables while you’re mid-routine, while\ntheir IPX5/8 water resistance rating means they shouldn’t have too much\ntrouble with your gross ear sweat.\n\nIf you want to ditch the phone entirely, then the SP900s are fitted with 4GB\nof internal memory, which you can use to load songs and podcasts onto in order\nto have them play locally. Yes, they’re not going to be able to handle you’re\nentire library of lossless FLAC files, but it’s more than enough for a workout\nsession.\n\nSpeaking of session lengths, like many true wireless earphones battery life\nmight be a constraining factor here. With the case you’re looking at around 12\nhours of playback, but you’ll have to charge the earbuds once every three\nhours to keep them topped up.\n\nThe WF-SP900 earphones will be priced at £250 when they’re released in\nNovember.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Sony MDR-Z7M2: The high-end ones\n\nIf you’re not fussed about noise-cancellation and want to pay a little more\nfor better audio quality, then the MDR-Z7M2s are Sony’s 2018 headphones that\nare aimed at you.\n\nThese are headphones that are impossible to judge on paper, and we’ll need to\nlisten to them for ourselves before we can start to unpack how useful most of\ntheir features are. You’ve got a Fibonacci-patterned grill for example, a\nLiquid Crystal Polymer diaphragm and a special acoustic port to optimise its\nmovement. Yeah, we’re not sure how useful each of these features are either,\nbut we’ll no doubt get a chance to hear for ourselves soon.\n\nSony even promises that the headphone’s ear-pads feature 3D sewing — if you’re\ninto that sort of thing.\n\nThe MDR-Z7M2 headphones will cost £750 when they’re released in October.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Sony IER-Z1R: The audiophile in-ear ones\n\nIf £750 seems expensive for a pair of headphones then you’re going to want to\navert your eyes for Sony’s high-end earphones, the IER-Z1Rs.\n\nThese include a similar Lyquid Crystal Polymer diaphragm to the MDR-Z7M2\n(albeit just 5mm in size rather than 70mm, and that work alongside two other\ndrivers), and a frequency response of up to 100kHz, well outside of the range\nof human ears.\n\nPerhaps most note-worthy is the price of these headphones. At £2000 they’re\nnot going to come cheap, and will be out of the budgets for all aside from the\nmost committed of audiophiles.\n\n**Have any of Sony’s headphones caught your eye at this year’s show?
