With powerful specs, a gorgeous design,\nand a wide array of useful features, the Galaxy Note 8 is undoubtedly one of\nthe most advanced smartphones ever.\n\n**Related:[iPhone 8 vs iPhone\n7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-8-vs-iphone-7-3286334)**\n\nBut Apple has also cooked up a new handset and it’s big. The company has\nskipped the iPhone 7S naming convention and has gone straight to the iPhone 8\nand the iPhone 8 Plus. These two devices will sit just below the 10th\nanniversary [iPhone X](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-x-release-\ndate-specs-features-uk-price-2951157), which was also revealed on September\n12.\n\nRight now we’re focusing on the mainstream iPhone 8 range, which maintains the\nsame design as its predecessor, but makes a number of massive improvements,\nassisted ably by the new [iOS\n11](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/ios-11) software.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\n  * **Buy now:** [**iPhone 8 (10GB) on O2 for £35/month – use voucher TRUSTED10**](https://www.awin1.com/pclick.php?p=21403023015&a=277673&m=380&clickref=tr-mobiledeals-iphone8)\n  * **Buy now:[iPhone 8 (15GB) on EE for £37.99/month – use voucher TRUSTED10](https://www.awin1.com/pclick.php?p=20565253359&a=277673&m=380&clickref=tr-mobiledeals-iphone8)**\n\n**Related:[Best smartphone](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nsmartphone)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: Max Parker / Trusted Reviews\n\n## Note 8 vs iPhone 8 Design: Which phone looks better?\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Note 8 is an exceptionally attractive phone. For a start,\nit’s got a huge, curved 6.3-inch display, which gives it more screen real\nestate than most other handsets.\n\nBut the real winning design feature is the ‘Infinity Display’, which we first\nsaw featured on the [Galaxy\nS8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s8) earlier this\nyear. In practice, it means that the overwhelming majority of the front of the\nGalaxy Note 8 is occupied by screen. This was achieved by scrapping the Home\nbutton and shunting the fingerprint sensor to the back of the phone.\n\n  * **Buy now:** [**iPhone 8 (10GB) on O2 for £35/month – use voucher TRUSTED10**](https://www.awin1.com/pclick.php?p=21403023015&a=277673&m=380&clickref=tr-mobiledeals-iphone8)\n  * **Buy now:[iPhone 8 (15GB) on EE for £37.99/month – use voucher TRUSTED10](https://www.awin1.com/pclick.php?p=20565253359&a=277673&m=380&clickref=tr-mobiledeals-iphone8)**\n\nIt’s a new and futuristic design, so barely any manufacturers have managed to\nmimic it yet. Apple has with the iPhone X, but the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus\nstill feature a home button and larger forehead and chin.\n\nThe iPhone 8 features a 4.7-inch display and the iPhone 8 Plus has an 5.5-inch\ndisplay, just like its predecessors.\n\n**Related:[iPhone 8 vs iPhone 8\nPlus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-8-vs-\niphone-8-plus-3286235)**![iPhone\n8](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nBoth Retina HD displays feature the True Tone technology. It adjusts “the\nwhite balance of the display to match the surrounding light for a more\nnatural, paper-like viewing experience,” Apple says.\n\nThe iPhone 8 range also features a glass-backed design, which Apple calls the\n‘most durable ever used in a smartphone.’ There’s also a new fetching gold\nhue, which you can see above.\n\n**Related:[iPhone 9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-9-release-\ndate-specs-features-price-rumours-uk-3297160)**\n\n## iPhone 8 vs Note 8 Specs: Which phone will be more powerful?\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Note 8 is seriously powerful, boasting a Qualcomm\n[Snapdragon 835](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/snapdragon-835-phones-\nprocessor-specs-speed-benchmark-chipset-cores-2944086) processor based on a\nhighly efficient 10nm manufacturing process, as well as a QHD+ resolution\ndisplay and a generous 6GB of RAM.\n\nThe iPhone, by comparison, debuts the new A11 Bionic processor. Apple says its\nthe smartest and most powerful processor ever seen in a smartphone. Naturally\nwe’ll reserve judgement until testing it, but it offers a 6-core CPU, each of\nwhich harnessed simultaneously, giving the iPhone 8 range 70% more power than\nthe iPhone 7.\n\n  * **Buy now:[Note 8 on Vodafone (16GB) £38/month, £150 upfront](https://www.awin1.com/pclick.php?p=21560819791&a=277673&m=380&clickref=tr-mobiledeals-note8)**\n  * **Buy now:[Note 8 on O2 (20GB) £44/month, £170 upfront](https://www.awin1.com/pclick.php?p=21584922677&a=277673&m=380&clickref=tr-mobiledeals-note8)**\n\n**Related:[Best iPhone 8 deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/best-\niphone-8-deals-3260322)**\n\n![iPhone 8\nBionic](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nA surprising inclusion is a new Apple-made 3-core GPU with 30% faster\ngraphics.\n\nSamsung’s latest flagship comes with 64GB of storage, which is fairly generous\nas a standard offering – but you can’t upgrade, except via a MicroSD card.\nApple is now offering 64GB as standard, with up to 256GB available for storage\nhounds. No MicroSD boosting here either.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: Max Parker / Trusted Reviews\n\nSamsung’s Note 8 has a few advantages over many of its rivals, including the\nbundled S-Pen stylus and a built-in iris scanner.\n\nWhile the iPhone X does have a Face ID scanner, that’s not present within the\niPhone 8 range, so Touch ID remains the main security feature for Apple’s\nsecond tier phones.\n\n**Read:[What is Face ID?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/what-is-face-\nid-3286453)**\n\nThis year Apple phones finally catch up to Samsung’s in one major respect:\nwireless charging. The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 now support the Qi standard for\nwirelessly charging devices. Goodbye Lightning cable, it was nice knowing you.\n\nBoth the Note 8 and iPhone 8 have the benefit of [Bluetooth\n5](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/what-is-bluetooth-5-2947121)\nconnectivity.\n\n## Note 8 vs iPhone 8: Camera showdown\n\nOne of the big new features for the Galaxy Note 8 was the introduction of a\ndual-camera arrangement. This means that the camera should be more capable in\nlow-light conditions, and will be able to offer better depth-of-field.\n\nHowever, Apple helped kickstart the dual-camera trend last year with its\n[iPhone 7 Plus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/iphone-7-plus-review) –\nalthough the [iPhone 7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/iphone-7-review)\nretained a single camera.\n\nThat trend continues this year. The iPhone 8 retains its single lens camera,\nwhile the iPhone 8 Plus has 12-megapixel dual cameras. The iPhone 8 Plus\nPortrait Mode now has a feature called Portrait Lighting which uses both\ncamera sensors to create a depth map and then light the subject’s face in real\ntime.\n\nApple explains: “It uses the dual cameras and the Apple-designed image signal\nprocessor to recognize the scene, create a depth map and separate the subject\nfrom the background. Machine learning is then used to create facial landmarks\nand add lighting over contours of the face, all happening in real time, giving\ncustomers even more power to express themselves through photography.”\n\n  * **Buy now:[Note 8 on Vodafone (16GB) £38/month, £150 upfront](https://www.awin1.com/pclick.php?p=21560819791&a=277673&m=380&clickref=tr-mobiledeals-note8)**\n  * **Buy now:[Note 8 on O2 (20GB) £44/month, £170 upfront](https://www.awin1.com/pclick.php?p=21584922677&a=277673&m=380&clickref=tr-mobiledeals-note8)**\n\n![iPhone 8 wireless\ncharging](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## iPhone 8 vs Note 8 Price and Release Date: Which phone will cost more?\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Note 8 is incredibly expensive at £869, making it one of\nthe most expensive consumer smartphones ever sold.\n\nThe iPhone 8 range starts at $699 for the standard 64GB model and $799 for the\niPhone 8 Plus 64GB.
