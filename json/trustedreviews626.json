We went along to put it through its paces and see\nhow it fares on the treadmill.**\n\nTo say the Apple Watch began finding its footing when it started focusing more\non fitness is probably an understatement. Since the launch of the more\nexercise-oriented [Apple Watch Series\n2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/apple-watch-2) – which introduced\nwater-resistance and built-in GPS – the Apple Watch has become more of a\nhybrid device that’s a fully-fledged sports watch and a smartwatch combined.\n\nThat focus continued with the [Apple Watch Series\n3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/apple-watch-3), which looked to\nremove more of the reliance on an iPhone carried in tow. The latest Series 3\nmodel has an altimeter for elevation data and optional LTE connectivity so\nyou’re never disconnected even if you leave your phone behind.\n\n![Apple Watch\nGymKit](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAnother new feature Apple showcased at its Series 3 reveal was its GymKit\nintegration, which is a part of the latest watchOS 4.1 operating system,\nmeaning it’s available across all Apple Watch devices. The new functionality\nallows the Apple Watch to communicate with compatible gym equipment, allowing\ntwo-way exchange of relevant information. For now, the focus is on cardio-\nbased machines, such as treadmills, ellipticals, indoor bikes and stair\nsteppers.\n\nSpeaking with Jay Blahnik, Apple’s Senior Director of Fitness for Health\nTechnologies, he sees integration very much as a way of removing some of the\npain points of beginning any indoor workout. After all, go for a run outdoors\nand distance and pace are all measured by the built-in GPS of the newer Apple\nWatch models. Go for a run on a treadmill in the past and all of this\ninformation and more, such as incline, is being accurately measured by the\ntreadmill but not on your Apple Watch. Conversely, your Apple Watch is\ncapturing lots of data not seen by the equipment, such as your heart rate.\n\nIt’s this disparate information that means accuracy is lost. Jay Blahnik told\nme that Apple’s own research show that most users simply hop on gym equipment\nand begin a Quick Workout. This means that important user data isn’t being\nprovided to the equipment, such as age, height and weight, meaning any calorie\nburn estimations are going to be way off the mark. Now, through GymKit, this\nuser data is instantly shared with the equipment.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n**Related:[How the Apple Watch stacks up against dedicated fitness\ntrackers](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/this-is-how-the-apple-\nwatch-2-stacks-up-against-dedicated-fitness-trackers-2937211)**\n\n![Apple Watch\nGymKit](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSimilarly, while in the past your Apple Watch could detect an increase in\neffort when you crank up the incline on the treadmill due to heightened heart\nrate and perceived effort, there was no cause and effect element. Now the\nequipment can deliver this extra layer of information to the Apple Watch, as\nwell as therefore providing information on elevation gain. It means runners\nperhaps relying on indoor treadmills in colder months can more closely emulate\nthe variable elevations of their outdoor runs – and have the data to back it\nall up.\n\nBlahnik also used the stair stepper as an example of how users value certain\ndata more depending on the activity. With the stair stepper, Apple’s studies\nhave shown that exercisers care more about the distance climbed, whether\nthat’s as high as the Empire State Building or Big Ben, rather than calories\nburned. Now, that stairs climbed figure can be shared with the Apple Watch and\nstored in the Workout app, just like any other exercise tracked directly on\nthe watch.\n\nEnrico Manaresi, TechnoGym’s Global PR Director said that retro-fitting recent\nexisting equipment was low cost and pain-free, in fact the Virgin Active\nbranch that’s debuting the GymKit integration was only done in a few hours. I\npopped along to the Mansion House branch to see all of this in action using\nthe club’s Technogym equipment, and the experience really couldn’t be any\nsimpler. Just tap the Apple Watch against the NFC reader on the relevant\nequipment then confirm the on-screen prompt on your watch and you’re off.\nWireless two-way synchronisation is then seamlessly happening between the two,\nintelligently sharing whichever metrics are more accurate.\n\n![Apple Watch\nGymKit](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSo your heart rate, captured by your Apple Watch, is delivered to the\nequipment and shown on screen. Jay confirmed to me that the heart rate data\ncan be sourced from external sensors, which is great news for anyone like me\nwho often wears a separate HRM strap (in my case currently a Polar OH1 on my\nupper arm). When the Apple Watch is paired with a Bluetooth HRM, it takes the\nplace of its own optical HRM, so the GymKit-paired equipment sees no\ndifference.\n\nIn the case of the Technogym treadmill I used, the heart rate data also means\nthat it can now also display both Active and Total Calories, two figures\nfamiliar to anyone who has used the Apple Watch’s native Workout app before.\nWhile the Total Calories figure is the complete number of calories burned\nduring that period, which includes those that would have been burned as part\nof your Basal Metabolic Rate (calories burned just existing), Active Calories\nshow the calories burned as a direct result of the exercise you’re currently\nconducting.\n\n**Related:[Best fitness trackers](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nfitness-tracker)**\n\n![Apple Watch\nGymKit](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAll of the information is being synced in complete real time between the Apple\nWatch and equipment, so any glances to your watch relays the same data as on\nthe screen of the treadmill. In this scenario, there’s really no reason to\nglance down at your wrist but it’s reassuring how quickly everything syncs.\nSimilarly, pause a workout on the treadmill and you feel an instant buzz from\nthe haptics of the Apple Watch to tell you it’s paused your workout.\n\nBut what happens if you forget to pair the two devices at the beginning of\nyour treadmill or elliptical session? Apple has thought of this. You can still\ntap your Apple Watch at any time and the treadmill’s already captured data is\nsent to the watch, a new workout is started and all of the data synchronised\nto the point of the treadmill. So whether you’re a minute into a run or 60\nminutes into an endurance session before you remember, none of that data is\nlost. Any data the treadmill has incorrectly estimated at that point will also\nbe updated to reflect any more accurate data from the Apple Watch. You can\neven do this GymKit pairing process at the end of the workout, provided the\nworkout summary is still on the screen of the equipment.\n\n**Related:[watchOS 4 features](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-\nwatchos-4-new-features-release-date-download-2950900)**\n\n![Apple Watch\nGymKit](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nI honestly could see myself more inclined to jump on the treadmill or\nelliptical as part of one of my gym-based workouts due to how seamlessly all\nof this data is captured. In the past, all of my cardio was outdoors and the\ngym was my strength training domain. But now I can tack on some of my\nconditioning work without the feeling that some of that effort is being\n‘wasted’ by not being captured.\n\nThe next step I hope, is a move beyond purely cardio-based equipment. While\nwearables geared towards free weights training still have some distance to go\nand are admittedly a much more difficult prospect to accurately capture, I\nfeel like there’s potential for GymKit to work with fixed strength training\nequipment. Imagine GymKit working with the chest press, automatically syncing\nthe weight racked and the reps achieved. Logging workouts would be a much\nsimpler prospect. Happily, this is something that Jay Blahnik wasn’t ruling\nout.\n\nWith Apple working with the vast majority of manufacturers, and the supposed\nease of retrofitting equipment, it should hopefully not be too long before you\nsee GymKit available in more gyms across the world. In a very Apple way, my\nGymKit taster session left me wondering why something like this hasn’t already\nhappened years ago.\n\n**Have you tried Apple GymKit yet?
