Its live coverage of Spain and Italy’s premiere football leagues kicked\noff in August 2018, and for the next three years, it will be home to the likes\nof Real Madrid, Juventus, Barcelona, Roma and Atletico Madrid for football\nfans based in the UK and Ireland.**\n\nFor some, its emergence means having to shell out even more to watch football\nthis season. However, for anyone that can’t afford a Sky Sports or BT Sport\nsubscription, Eleven Sports gets you a lot of bang for not very many bucks.\n\nIt might not be a gateway to the Champions League or Premier League (for UK-\nbased customers, anyway), but Eleven Sports shows loads of top-quality Spanish\nand Italian fixtures every week, featuring some of the best teams and biggest\nsuperstars in the game − including a certain Lionel Messi and Cristiano\nRonaldo.\n\nIt’s also the place to be for live Eredivisie, Allsvenskan (the Swedish top\nflight) and Chinese Super League (from 2019) action.\n\nHere’s everything you need to know about Eleven Sports, including prices,\npackages and matches.

You can also cast games from your computer to your TV through\nGoogle Chrome.\n\nDon’t have a Google Chromecast? You can always connect your laptop to your\ntelly the old-fashioned way, via HDMI.\n\n## Eleven Sports streams\n\nEleven Sports sadly isn’t yet available in 4K − at present, live streams top\nout at 1080p. The company also recommends being on a connection with a minimum\ndownload speed of 6Mbps for the smoothest streaming experience.\n\nAs well as live streams, the company will let you watch highlights on-demand.\nWhat’s more, any matches it shows live will be available on-demand – and in\ntheir entirety, boring bits and all – for a full 24 hours.\n\nAs games are being streamed and not televised, we’d recommend staying away\nfrom Twitter and any live blogs, in order to avoid spoilers.\n\n“As with all online streaming, there will be a short delay on our live\noutput,” the company has confirmed. “The Eleven Sports platform will feature\nadaptive playback which dynamically adjusts the quality of the video stream\nyou receive based on the speed of your connection.”\n\n**Are you tempted by Eleven Sports?
