The\nNintendo Switch release will also launch with new motion controls and HD\nRumble support.\n\nControlling an adhesive sphere, you roll it around a variety of stages\ncollecting stationery, animals, buildings and mountains, with levels growing\nin absurdity the larger you become. It’s wonderfully silly, propelled further\nby an excellent J-Pop soundtrack that will have you singing along in no time.\n\nWe imagine the upcoming remaster will contain many of the modes found in the\noriginal such as Make a Star, Make a Moon and Eternal Stages. The objective of\neach level is to gather enough objects using your sticky balls to please to\nKing of the Cosmos – a mysterious floating fellow who watches over the\nuniverse. Yes, it’s as silly as it sounds.\n\n**Related:[Best Nintendo Switch\nGames](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/nintendo-switch-games-3435122)**\n\nOne completely new feature, aside from motion controls, is local multiplayer\nbattles. The goal here is to, presumably, compete with a friend as you each\ntry to gather as many objects as possible. This feels like a wonderful fit for\nthe Nintendo Switch portable mode if you aren’t against squeezing around a\nconsole.\n\n**Will you be picking up Katamari Damacy REROLL later this year?
