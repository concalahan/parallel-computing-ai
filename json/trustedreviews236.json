Now, six months on\nfrom April’s Creators Update, comes the next OS refresh: the Fall Creators\nUpdate.\n\nRather than make sweeping changes to the OS, Microsoft has taken the\nopportunity to focus on its Mixed Reality platform, with only minor tweaks to\nthe rest of the OS.\n\n## How to download the Fall Creators Update when it goes live\n\nBefore I start this review, here’s how to download the update before Microsoft\nrolls it out to your PC.\n\nSimply head to the [Windows 10 Media Creation\ntool](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10 \"Windows 10\nmedia creation\") page on Microsoft’s website. You should see a grey bar that\nstates “We noticed you are running Windows 10. If you would like to update to\nthe latest version, click Update now.” The update will likely be available\nthis afternoon UK time, so we’d advise waiting ’til then.\n\n![Download\nW10](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nClick on the ‘Update Now’ button and follow the steps in the window that\nopens, and that should do the trick. The download will run in the background\nand will then ask you to restart to finalise the installation.\n\n![Download\ntool](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Google Home Hub YouTube](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Will Google Home Hub ever get Netflix?

Search for ‘recovery’ in the Start Menu to get\none set up before you download the Creators Update.\n\nNow, on with the review:\n\n## Windows 10 Fall Creators Update – Mixed Reality\n\nMixed Reality is the main focus of the Fall Creators Update, with changes\nrunning through several applications. As the name suggests, the technology is\nabout overlaying the virtual onto the real world, in the same vein as the\nHoloLens.\n\nIn practice, Mixed Reality doesn’t quite live up to that promise, with the\nmajority of experiences actually pure virtual reality (VR). In fact, the main\ntrue mixed-reality experience comes in Paint 3D and the new Mixed Reality\nViewer app.\n\nThis application was introduced in the Creators Update, but the Fall version\nof the app now works with devices that have a camera – the [Surface\nPro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/surface-pro), for example. Models\nyou generate or download in the app can be projected and placed into the real\nworld via the Mixed Reality app. As you move your device around, you can move\naround the model and view it from different angles. It’s neat to watch, but\nisn’t anything that we haven’t seen before on various other devices and\nsmartphones, with Pokémon Go a good example.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nA bigger change comes from the Mixed Reality Portal, which would better be\ndescribed as the virtual reality portal. This app is designed to work with the\nMixed Reality headsets, which are really virtual reality headsets. Microsoft’s\nnaming convention is certainly a little confusing at the moment.\n\nUsing the Mixed Reality Portal, you get your own home to walk around (Cliff\nHouse). As well as serving as an app launcher, Cliff House lets you view your\nWindows desktop, create a virtual cinema experience and view other types of\nmedia.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nOf course, gaming is one of the key uses for Mixed Reality headsets,\ncontrolled via the wireless controllers (one for each hand). The few demos\nthat I’ve tried have been neat, delivering an immersive experience, but I’ll\nhold off on a final judgement until _Trusted Reviews_ has the opportunity to\nput some of the headsets through their paces. I won’t go into more detail on\nthe Mixed Reality Portal, as _Trusted_ has covered the technology and has\n[explained all of the headsets and\nexperiences](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/windows-mixed-reality-all-\nthe-headsets-and-experiences-explained-3277850) already.\n\n## Windows 10 Fall Creators Update – Fluent Design\n\nMicrosoft is using the Fall Creators Update to debut its Fluent Design. Don’t\nexpect to see huge changes to the way that Windows looks; Fluent Design is\nrather subtle. For example, you can see the ‘Acrylic’ effect in the Start\nmenu, where a subtle transparency replaces the solid design of the original.\nWith Fluent Design, scroll bars disappear when you move your cursor away from\nthem, shrinking out of view.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe changes are difficult to spot, but they make Windows 10 feel like a more\nmodern and sleek operating system. And the impact should become greater, as\ndevelopers start using the same design language. That is if you actually\ndownload and use [Windows 10 Store](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nwindows-10-apps) apps.\n\nFor anyone that wants to resize the Start menu, you’ll be pleased to know that\noptions are available diagonally, as well as vertically and horizontally.\n\n## Windows 10 Fall Creators Update – Photos Remix\n\nThe Photos app sees a big overhaul; it’s now called Photos Remix. This update\nadds some features that you’re probably familiar with from Google Photos or\nmacOS Photos. Photos will now automatically scan your images so that you can\nsearch for objects.\n\nA search for ‘cat’ didn’t produce the expected results, with Photos displaying\na couple of pictures of a hippo, two of an owl, a couple of a fox, and one of\na monkey – all at the top of the list. It also found some pictures of cats,\nwhich was nice.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nGoogle Photos, running with the same set of images, was more accurate in its\nsearch. Although it picked up a picture of a hippo and a monkey, these sat\nalomgide a wider mix of cat photos. Google Photos is also smarter, so you can\nfilter by type, such as ‘black cat’; Photos Remix didn’t find anything when\nusing the same term.\n\nBasic photo editing is built into Photos, letting you apply filters, adjust\nthe colour and brightness, spot-fix errors, remove red-eye, and adjust and\ncrop an image. These simple tools are fine for light photo editors, but don’t\nmatch the more detailed controls available with macOS Photos. Serious\nphotographers will need to rely on other software for editing.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nWith the new Creations feature, Photos Remix can automatically edit photos and\nvideos together for you, overlaying music. The software will add motion and\nzoom to photos automatically, too. If you don’t like the results, you can just\nhit the ‘Remix it for me’ button and Photos will have another go.\nAlternatively, you can edit it all manually, controlling motion, display time\nand music choice. Creations is a fun feature that offers a good way to put\nphotos together in a slick slideshow.\n\nTying in with the 3D film, you can overlay 3D effects to video files – say,\nadding in a blizzard or the odd explosion. It’s fun, but far from an essential\nfeature.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Windows 10 Fall Creators Update – People Bar\n\nPeople Bar is a new utility that sits to the left of the Notification Area.\nIt’s designed to provide quick access to your contacts, and you can even pin\nyour main ones to the taskbar.\n\nFrom a contact, you can launch into an email (provided you use the built-in\nMail client) or take part in a Skype conversation. It’s a shame there’s no\nintegration with Cortana’s ability to send SMS messages via your Android\nphone, though.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nI found that the People Bar felt like a clunky third-party add-on; it isn’t\nthe kind of feature I’d often use, if at all. You might find it more useful if\nyou frequently use the built-in Mail app and Skype. Fortunately, you can turn\noff People Bar in Settings if you don’t want to use it.\n\n## Windows 10 Fall Creators Update – OneDrive\n\nOneDrive used to have a brilliant feature called Placeholders, where it was\npossible to view all of your files, but only some were downloaded on-demand.\nThat feature is back with the Fall Creators Update, and it’s called Files on\nDemand. It saves disk space by not downloading everything. You can, of course,\nmark the files that you want for permanent offline use.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Windows 10 Fall Creators Update – Android linking\n\nYou can link your Android phone or iPhone to your Windows 10 PC so you can\nshare data between them. To do this, you need to have the Microsoft apps\ninstalled for Android.\n\nThere’s currently only one feature implemented: Continue on PC. From a web\nbrowser on your Android phone, select the Share option and tap the ‘Continue\non PC’ icon to send the website to your computer. You can also do the same in\nthe Cortana app with news stories. Anything sent to your computer will appear\nimmediately, or will be delivered to the Action Center, so you can deal with\nit later. Annoyingly, Windows 10 opens sent links in Edge, and there’s no way\nto change this, even if you’ve opted for a different default browser. In\naddition, there’s no way to reverse the process, so you can’t send items from\nyour PC to your phone.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThis feature is a step in the right direction, but it doesn’t go far enough\nand feels a little limited. It’s also a shame that some other features that\nMicrosoft had touted for the Fall Creators Update haven’t been included.\nThere’s currently no option to receive incoming call alerts on Android (you\nonly get missed call alerts), plus there’s [no Timeline\nfeature](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/windows-10-s-best-new-feature-\nwon-t-make-it-into-the-fall-creators-update-2953483), which would let you pick\nup where you left off, moving seamlessly between PC and Android or iOS. This\nfeature has been pushed back, so we may not see it until 2018 now.\n\n## Windows 10 Fall Creators Update – Edge\n\nEdge’s updates are minor. Better PDF and EPUB handling are the standout\noptions, including the ability to use Ink directly via Edge. There’s nothing\nto really grab the attention here, and as such Chrome remains the superior\nbrowser in my opinion.\n\n## Windows 10 Fall Creators Update – Cortana\n\nCortana, too, benefits from only minor tweaks. You can now use your voice to\nlock your PC, shut down or restart. These commands aren’t that useful, and I\nfind it far easier to use the lock shortcut (Windows+L), and the standard\nshutdown/restart controls.\n\nMore usefully, Cortana’s settings have been moved into the Settings app, where\nthey should have been from the start. This provides a more consistent\ninterface and makes it easier to find various settings.\n\nCortana now has pop-outs that can display more information on a query, such as\nweb results. This is a neat way of drilling down to get more information – but\nit’s a shame that you’re still limited to using Bing, and that search results\nopen in Edge.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Windows 10 Fall Creators Update – Settings and update\n\nThe Settings app continues to evolve, and more options are being ported over\nfrom the old Control Panel. Now, the About setting is cleaner and easier to\nunderstand, providing an overview of your PC’s health, the option to change\nyour computer’s name, and general specs.\n\nOne annoying change is the default apps option, which is now the only way to\nchange how certain file types are opened. In previous versions of Windows 10,\nthe Control Panel version of default apps let you select a program and choose,\nwith one click, to give it all of its default options. It was a great way to\noverride some of Windows 10’s more annoying habits, such as opening PDFs in\nEdge.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nWith the Fall Creators Update, you can’t just give an app all of its defaults\nwith one click. Instead, you have to choose each option manually. This feels\nlike a step backwards.\n\n## Windows 10 Fall Creators Update – Windows Update\n\nWindows Update now displays information on individual updates, so you can see\nthe current status and anything that you might need to do, such as restarting\nyour computer.\n\nMicrosoft also gives you control over the bandwidth that updates use – you can\nmanually set the bandwidth at which items are downloaded. And if you have PC\nset up to share downloads with other internet users, you can set a bandwidth\nand monthly upload limit, too. This is handy if you’re on a metered\nconnection, or don’t want your bandwidth to be hogged by updates.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Should I install the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update?\n\nThe Fall Creators Update is so focused on delivering Mixed Reality that the\nother changes feel comparatively minor. Yet, they’re important steps as\nWindows 10 matures and evolves.\n\nUltimately, this isn’t an update that Home users can skip. Microsoft sees the\nFall Creators Update as a continuation of the Windows 10 experience, and as\nsuch, you’ll need to update to it at some point in the future if you want to\nreceive the latest security patches.\n\nUnless you’re going to rush out and buy a Mixed Reality headset, there’s no\ncompelling reason upgrade on day one. Instead, we recommend waiting until your\nPC receives the upgrade invite – which could take weeks or even months. This\nshould provide enough time for any major bugs to be ironed out, ensuring your\nPC is stable once you do finally run the update.\n\n**Verdict**  \nMixed Reality aside, this update is full of minor tweaks and subtle changes\nthat could be hard to spot.\n\n## Score\n\n  \n\n"}
