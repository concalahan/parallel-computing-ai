This handset isn’t, however, intended to rival market leaders in the\nspecs department. STK is, instead, hoping to appeal to customers by delivering\nan unrivalled support system. Here’s the low-down.**\n\n## What is the STK X2?\n\nDescribed by STK as a “OnePlus for non-techies,” the X2 is an affordable mid-\nto-high-end Android smartphone that’s been designed to deliver a powerful\npunch at a low price. It’s set to launch in the United Kingdom sometime in\nApril, where it will command a modest £259.\n\n**Related:[MWC 2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/mwc-2018-news-\nrumours-dates-preview-barcelona-3372243)**\n\n## STK X2 Specs: Is it powerful?\n\n| **STK X2**  \n---|---  \n**Battery** |  3000mAh Li-Polymer  \n**Camera (Front)** |  16MP  \n**Camera (Rear)** |  16MP + 16MP  \n**Display** |  5.7-inch 18:9 HD+ (1440 x 720)  \n**Processor** |  MediaTek MT6750V  \n**Storage** |  64GB (expandable via microSD)  \n**RAM** |  4GB  \n  \n## STK X2 First Look: What’s it like?\n\nLet’s not beat around the bush: the STK X2 feels really good. I had a chance\nto handle it at MWC, and it doesn’t feel like a sub-£300 smartphone. The unit\nitself is almost entirely made from durable 3D glass – save for the aluminium\nframe that’s used to hold everything together – which a characteristic that’s\nshared by the market-leading [Samsung Galaxy\nS8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s8).\n\n**Related:[Samsung Galaxy S9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-\ngalaxy-s9)**\n\nThe 5.7-inch HD+ screen was pleasant to look at, achieving a somewhat decent\nmaximum brightness. I can’t help but wish, however, that it was an OLED panel,\nas it struggled to match the rich colours found on the [OnePlus\n5T](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/oneplus-5t). Maybe one day we’ll\nget a phone at this price with an OLED.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nPerformance seemed good. The handset blitzed all the tasks I threw its way,\nkeeping a straight face while switching between multiple intensive\napplications. That’s apparently down to STK Care, a ROM-based optimisation\ntool that’s intended make the STK X2 feel like it’s brand new every time you\npick it up. We’ll need to spend lots more time with the phone to see if that’s\nreally the case though.\n\nThere’s a dual-camera setup on the rear (13MP + 13MP) and a 16MP shooter on\nthe front, though I didn’t have a chance to try out either during my time with\nthe device. Based on the samples I flicked through, however, it’s adequate.\nShots taken in daylight looked crisp, while those snapped at night lacked\nclarity and detail.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nWhere the STK X2 goes above and beyond is in the software department. It ships\nrunning a near-vanilla build of [Android 8.1\nOreo](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/android-8-1-oreo-features-release-\ndate-download-changes-phones-3317301) that’s armed with a slew of additional\nsupport features, including a 24-hour support system and an on-device\ndiagnostic tool for troubleshooting hardware issues – like a faulty GPS chip.\n\n## STK X2 Release Date and Price: When will it hit the shelves, and how much\nwill it cost?\n\nThe STK X2 will hit the shelves in the UK in April. It will be priced at £259\noutright. There’s no word on whether it’ll make its way to additional markets.\n\n**Do you like the sound of the STK X2?
