Has Sammy beaten Google at its own\ngame? We take a look.  \n****  \n** Google’s Pixel phone is widely considered to be the best Android handset\navailable. But before the Pixel arrived at the tail end of last year, Samsung\nwas riding high with its Galaxy S7, and now it’s back with the Galaxy S8 –\ngiving Google cause for worry.\n\nThe new S8 certainly looks very impressive on paper. A powerhouse in the\nhardware stakes, with a new design that gives you more screen and less bezel,\nand even its own AI assistant to rival Google’s own Google Assistant, this is\na phone to be reckoned with.\n\nBut does the S8 really manage to outdo what might be the best Android handset\nout right now? Well, we might as well take a look.  \n**  \nRelated:[Galaxy S8 vs Galaxy\nS8+](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/galaxy-s8-vs-s8-plus)  \n**\n\n## Galaxy S8 vs Google Pixel Design: What’s the difference?\n\nLet’s get this out of the way: the Galaxy S8, and its larger S8+ counterpart,\nare the best-looking phones you can buy. There’s no question here. Samsung has\nadded curved edges to both the S8 and S8+, and they look incredible. Gentler\nthan the curves on the S7 Edge, the sloping, newly-enlarged screen, looks\nfantastic, and marks a turning point in smartphone design – which has remained\nstale for some time.\n\n![galaxys8\n15](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)_The Galaxy S8 and S8+_\n\n**No home button, much smaller bezels, curved screen, glass back** – the\nGalaxy S8 is the finest handset you can buy. Which means the Google Pixel was\nnever going to win this won, but that doesn’t mean it’s ugly. It’s just… safe.\nIt looks like the prototype model for every smartphone you’ve used in the past\ncouple of years.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n###  Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nThe body is made from metal and glass, and the bezels are about as big as any\nother phone from last year. The **fingerprint sensor is on the back** , much\nlike on the new S8 and S8+, and the sides are heavily chamfered. It’s nice.\nJust not Galaxy S8 nice.\n\nPerhaps the biggest difference between the S8 and the Pixel, or at least the\nmost notable, is the display. Samsung calls its new **5.8-inch screen** (\n**6.2-inch** on the S8+) an ‘Infinity Display’. That basically means it’s\nlonger than on previous models, coming with a 18.5:9 aspect ratio. It looks\nstunning from a design perspective, but the Super AMOLED panel with 1440 x\n2960 resolution also shows outstanding images. It’s also equipped with\n**Mobile HDR** tech so you can watch the latest HDR offerings from Netflix and\nAmazon.\n\nNo such luck on the Pixel, though you do get a **5-inch, 1080p display**\nwhich, when we reviewed the phone, produced some impressive results. There’s\njust no question Samsung has the upper hand here, even when you take into\naccount the [Pixel XL](https://www.trustedreviews.com/google-pixel-xl-\nreview#tr-review-summary)‘s larger 5.5-inch screen, which comes with a more\npixel-packed 1440 x 2560. Google also uses AMOLED tech on its phone, so you\ncan at least rest assured blacks will be nice and inky, and energy consumption\nwill be low.\n\n**Related:[Galaxy S8 vs Galaxy\nS7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s8-vs-galaxy-s7)**\n\n![Google Pixel and Pixel XL\nreview](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)_The Pixel and Pixel XL  \n_  \nSpeaking of measurements, the S8 comes in at 140.1 x 72.2 x 7.3mm, while the\nPlus model measures 152.4 x 78.5 x 7.9mm. Google’s handset measures 143.8 x\n69.5 x 8.5mm, so it’s slightly longer and thicker than the S8. Considering you\nget a bigger screen on the latter, that’s pretty impressive for Samsung. The\nlarger Pixel XL, meanwhile, comes in at 154.7 x 75.7 x 8.5mm.\n\nFinally, you’ve got a choice of colours when it comes to Samsung’s phones. The\nS8 and S8+ are available in dark black, bright silver, or a grey with a\nblueish tinge. Google also offers different finishes in the form of the\nnauseatingly named “Quite Black”, “Very Silver”, and “Really Blue”.\n\nAll in all: Google Pixel looks good, Galaxy S8 looks better.\n\n## Galaxy S8 vs Google Pixel Specs: Which phone is the most powerful?\n\nSammy has whacked Qualcomm’s latest **Snapdragon 835 chip** in the US versions\nof the S8 and S8+, while those in the UK will be getting versions of the\nhandsets with Samsung’s own Exynos 8895 chip. The Snapdragon comes with a load\nof new technology such as 25% better energy efficiency over the Snapdragon\n820, Bluetooth 5 support, better graphics, and of course a more powerful octa-\ncore CPU. But there’s no need to be concerned if you’re not getting the\nSnapdragon version. Both Qualcomm and Samsung’s chipsets are built on the new\n10nm process and offer the latest hardware innovations.\n\n**Related:[Galaxy S7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-\ngalaxy-s7-review)**  \n![pixel\n11](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThose chips are backed up by 4GB of RAM which should make for some seriously\nspeedy performance. Samsung neglected to up the RAM to 6GB, and in all\nhonesty, 4GB of RAM with a Snapdragon 835 or Exynos 8895 is plenty to ensure\nlightning-fast performance. Alongside that, there’s **64GB of internal\nstorage** , plus a microSD card slot for those looking to expand the internal\nstorage up to 256GB.\n\nThe Google Pixel and Pixel XL came out last year, and as such, don’t offer the\nvery latest in phone hardware. But it’s important to note, the **Snapdragon\n821** at the heart of the Pixel is an incredibly fast processor that won’t run\ninto any trouble with any app or game you throw at it. That comes along with\n4GB of RAM and either **32 or 128GB** of internal storage. In all, you\nprobably won’t notice much difference in performance between the\n\nThere is, however, a difference in the battery department, Samsung offers a\n3000mAh cell on the S8 which has us slightly concerned that the new large\nscreen will drain the battery fully in a day, but we’re yet to test that out.\nThe the larger S8+ comes with a 3500mAh offering, which should be enough to\nkeep the thing going all day, but again, we’ll have to test this out.\n\n![galaxys8\n17](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nGoogle, on the other hand, has packed a 2770mAh battery in the Pixel, and\nalthough it’s smaller than the cell in the Galaxy S8, we did find it managed\nto keep the phone charged all day – though, you’ll need to charge the Pixel\nevery night. The Pixel XL, on the other hand, comes with a 3450mAh battery,\nwhich keeps the phone running through the day and into the next.\n\nBattery might be on area where Samsung has been outdone, then, but camera-\nwise, things should be quite even. You’ll find a **12-megapixel** offering on\nthe front. That’s the same megapixel count as last year, and, in all, not much\nhas really changed since the S7. The big difference is that the S8 will now\ntake three pictures when you tap the shutter, combining them together to\ncreate a shot with less blur and better colour accuracy.\n\nThe 12-megapixel sensor is backed up by an f/1.7 aperture and optical image\nstabilisation. The Dual Pixel tech also makes a return from last year. Seeing\nas the S7 had the best smartphone camera available in 2016, we’re not worried\nthat little has changed this time. We’ll have more once we’ve actually used\nthe handset for a prolonged period.\n\nOn the Pixel, you’ll find a **12.3-megapixel sensor with EIS and an f/2.0\naperture**. On paper, it’s not quite up to S8 standards but we were incredibly\nimpressed with the camera when we reviewed the Pixel and Pixel XL last year.\nIt did a fantastic job of handling low-light shots, and in some cases\nsurpassed its rivals, the iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7. It’s going to be interesting\nto see whether the S8 will be able to gain an edge in the camera stakes this\nyear.\n\n![pixel\n35](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nElsewhere, you’ll find **USB Type-C** ports on both Samsung and Google’s\nhandsets, but there’s a few areas where Sammy has the upper hand. First up is\nwaterproofing. **The S8 and S8+ come IP68** – **rated** for full waterproofing\nwhile the Pixel doesn’t have any such protection. It also doesn’t have microSD\ncard slot, or wireless charging, while Samsung’s phones offer both. The Pixel\nalso lacks the new iris scanner that appears on the top bezel of the Galaxy\nS8.\n\nOverall, the day-to-day performance of both handsets will be nothing short of\nstellar. Samsung’s handset, however, comes with a load of extras that give it\nthe edge in terms of hardware and features.\n\n**Related:[Best Android Phones 2017](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-\nandroid-phones-1_round-up)**\n\n**For a full spec comparison, check out the table below:**\n\n|  Galaxy S8 | Google Pixel  \n---|---|---  \n**Screen** |  5.8 inches | 5 inches  \n**Display Resolution** |  1440 x 2960 pixels | 1080 x 1920 pixels (441ppi)  \n**Screen-to-body Ratio** |  84.4% | 69%  \n**Aspect Ratio** |  18.5:9 Infinity Display | 16:9  \n**Dimensions** |  148.9 x 68.1 x 8.0mm | 143.8 x 69.5 x 8.5mm  \n**Chipset** |  Qualcomm Snapdragon 835/Exynos 8895 | Qualcomm Snapdragon 821  \n**RAM** |  4GB | 4GB  \n**Storage** |  64GB – expandable | 32 or 128GB  \n**Rear Camera** |  12-megapixel OIS, f/1.7 | 12.3-megapixel EIS, f/2.0  \n**Front Camera** |  8-megapixel, f/1.7 auto focus | 8-megapixel, f/2.4  \n**Battery Size** |  3000mAh | 2770mAh  \n**Charging** |  Fast battery charging, Wireless | Fast battery charging  \n**Headphone Jack** |  Yes | Yes  \n**Waterproof** |  Yes (IP68 Certified) | No  \n**Connectivity** |  Wi-Fi, 4G/LTE, USB-C | Wi-Fi, 4G/LTE, USB-C  \n**Colours** |  Midnight, Grey and silver | Quite Black, Very Silver, Really\nBlue  \n  \n| Galaxy S8+ | Google Pixel XL  \n---|---|---  \n**Screen** |  6.2 inches | 5.5 inches  \n**Display Resolution** |  1440 x 2960 pixels | 1440 x 2560 pixels (534ppi)  \n**Screen-to-body Ratio** |  88.6% | 71.2%  \n**Aspect Ratio** |  18.5:9 Infinity Display | 16:9  \n**Dimensions** |  159.5 x 73.4 x 8.1mm | 154.7 x 75.7 x 8.5mm  \n**Chipset** |  Qualcomm Snapdragon 835/Exynos 8895 | Qualcomm Snapdragon 821  \n**RAM** |  4GB | 4GB  \n**Storage** |  64GB – expandable | 32 or 128GB – expandable  \n**Rear Camera** |  12-megapixel OIS, f/1.7 | 12.3-megapixel EIS, f/2.0  \n**Front Camera** |  8-megapixel, f/1.7 auto focus | 8-megapixel, f/2.4  \n**Battery Size** |  3500mAh | 3450mAh  \n**Charging** |  Fast battery charging, Wireless | Fast battery charging  \n**Headphone Jack** |  Yes | Yes  \n**Waterproof** |  Yes (IP68 Certified) | No  \n**Connectivity** |  Wi-Fi, 4G/LTE, USB-C | Wi-Fi, 4G/LTE, USB-C  \n**Colours** |  Midnight black, Grey and silver | Quite Black, Very Silver,\nReally Blue  \n  \n**Related:[Best Android Apps 2017](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-\nandroid-apps_round-up)**\n\n## Galaxy S8 vs Google Pixel OS: Which phone has better software?\n\n**Android 7.0 Nougat** appears on both the Samsung and Google phones. It’s a\ngreat entry in the Android series, keeping all the good stuff from previous\nversions of the operating system and adding a load of new features to improve\noverall functionality. New features include richer drop-down menus, enhanced\ngaming with the addition of Vulkan API support, and multi-window multi-\ntasking. On top of that, a new Doze function will help conserve battery power,\nand revised notifications offer more options to interact with apps from the\nnotification menu.\n\nFor a full breakdown of features, check out our comprehensive [Android 7.0\nNougat](https://www.trustedreviews.com/android-7-0-nougat-review) guide.\n\nOf course, one of the benefits of buying Google’s phone is that it comes with\na completely untouched version of Android. Google uses its own devices to\ndebut new versions of the OS, and the Pixel was the launch device for Nougat.\nThere’s no proprietary skins overlaid on the standard OS on the Pixel phones,\njust pure Android goodness.\n\n![galaxys8\n23](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSamsung, on the other hand, is one of the companies that likes to add its own\nskin to the Android experience, and while TouchWiz, as it’s called, used to be\na major drag, it’s now not too bad. In fact, the OS looks pretty good, with\nSamsung updating app icons to look a lot more mature, and making the skin far\nless intrusive. Last year saw the start of a much improved TouchWiz, and this\nyear, Samsung may have just refined the skin to the point it’s actually a\nwelcome addition.\n\nAlong with the new skin comes **Bixby, Samsung’s own AI assistant**. It’s the\ncompany’s attempt to rival the likes of Siri, Cortana, and of course, **Google\nAssistant.** Google made a big deal of debuting its new assistant – an\nupgraded version of Google Now – on the Pixel, but now it’s got even more\ncompetition. Bixby will be arriving with only Korean and US English built in,\nbut those of us in the UK will have to wait for full support to arrive later\nin the year, along with other countries.\n\nThere’s a dedicated Bixby button on the side, and there’s a clever new camera\nfeature that lets you scan items and search online for the best price. Whether\nit outdoes Google Assistant is yet to be seen, but we’ll have more soon.\n\n## Galaxy S8 vs Google Pixel Price: Which phone is better value for money?\n\nUK pricing has been confirmed as £689 for the Galaxy S8 and £779 for the\nGalaxy S8+. That’s about what we were expecting, though it is a lot of money\nto spend.\n\n![pixel 7](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe Google Pixel, on the other hand, can be picked up for around £600, while\nthe Pixel XL is available for about £720. There are deals to be had now and\nthen, of course, but on the whole, the Pixel phones are only slightly cheaper\nthan the S8 and S8+, both of which come with significantly upgraded hardware.\n\n## Should you get the Galaxy S8 or the Google Pixel?\n\nIf you’re weighing up your options, here’s our advice about which phone you\nshould buy.\n\n**If you want the best possible hardware, go for the S8.** While there’s going\nto be very little difference when it comes to performance, the S8 simply has\nthe latest and best hardware. If you’re a serious power user, the S8 is the\nbest phone you can buy right now, at least on paper.\n\n**If you like a bigger screen, it’s all about the S8+.** The S8+ comes with a\nmassive 6.2-inch screen, but keeps the form factor relatively compact thanks\nto the lack of bezels allowing for more display real estate. If you’re going\nto be watching a lot of Netflix on the go, the Super AMOLED, pixel packed,\nlarge screen should be just what you need.\n\n**If you want a pure Android experience, the Pixel is the best bet.** As it’s\na Google phone, the Pixel comes with a standard, untouched version of Android,\nwhich for many, will be a big deal. Samsung’s skin isn’t bad – far from it –\nbut if you like your Android Nougat pure, the Pixel is the way to go.\n\n**Consider the alternatives before purchasing either phone.** The [LG\nG6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/lg-g6-review) launched earlier this year\nand comes with a similarly enlarged display to the new Galaxy phones, along\nwith no home button. It’ll probably be around the same price as the S8,\nthough, and the hardware isn’t quite as up to date as the S8’s – though it is\nabout the same as the Pixel. If you’re looking to spend less there’s the\n[OnePlus 3T](https://www.trustedreviews.com/oneplus-3t-review) which comes\nwith the Snapdragon 821 of the Pixel but for under £400. And if you’re\nintrigued to see what Apple has in-store this year, the [iPhone\n8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-8-release-date-specs-rumours-\nprice-uk) will be arriving around September or October, so bear that in mind.\n\n## Galaxy S8 vs Google Pixel Summary: What’s the difference?\n\nHere’s a brief overview of the key differences between the Galaxy S8 and\nGalaxy S8 Plus.\n\n**Design** : There’s no competition here really. The Pixel looks good, but the\nS8 is a turning point in smartphone design, and simply looks great. It’s also\nwaterproof and comes with a microSD card slot – both of which are lacking from\nGoogle’s handset.\n\n**Specs:** While the Galaxy S8 is no doubt more powerful than the Pixel, in\npractice, you probably won’t notice much different. Both phones have great\ninternals that will provide a smooth user experience. But, if you want to be\nprecise, the S8’s Snapdragon 835/Exynos 8895 chips beat the Pixel’s Snapdragon\n821 easily.  \n**  \nPrice:** The Galaxy S8 and S8+, can be picked up for £689 and £779\nrespectively. Google’s handset is available for £600, while the larger Pixel\nXL is on sale for around £720. That’s still likely to be cheaper than the\nGalaxy phones, but not by much.\n\n**Value:** Seeing as there’s likely to be little difference between the S8 and\nPixel in terms of price, we’d have to say the S8 takes this one, thanks to the\nupgraded hardware, stellar design, and extra features. And all for only\nslightly more than Google wants for its phone.\n\nWe’ll have more once we’ve done a full review of the Galaxy S8.\n\n**Let us know which phone you think clinches it in the comments below.**\n\n"}
