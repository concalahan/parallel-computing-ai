It’s also ‘Mobile HDR Premium’ certified,so you’ll be able to stream HDR (high dynamic range) shows from Amazon Primeand Netflix when those apps are updated. Arguably, [HDR is the most importantevolution in TV tech](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/hdr-tv-high-dynamic-television-explained) is recent years, offering better contrast and abrighter picture.Colours are gloriously vivid, but it manages to avoid oversaturating brightershades while still displaying the deepest black. Like the iPhone 7, it coversthe DCI-P3 cinema-grade colour gamut for a much wider spectrum of colours, andin certain situations, the brightness can break the 1000-nit barrier.Considering most phones, including the LG G6, only go up to about 650 nits,this is seriously impressive stuff. In fact, this screen is so bright that Ican keep it on 25% brightness and it’s perfectly visible indoors.### Best Samsung Galaxy S8 deals – 10-30GB of data[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=6224&clickref=TR-S8Deals&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fonehouse.co.uk%2Fshoppingcart.aspx%3Fhtrid%3D167090%26gid%3D0%26colid%3D904%26isnew%3D0%26IsPreOrder%3Dbuy%2520now)[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=6224&clickref=TR-S8Deals&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fonehouse.co.uk%2Fshoppingcart.aspx%3Fhtrid%3D167090%26gid%3D0%26colid%3D904%26isnew%3D0%26IsPreOrder%3Dbuy%2520now)###[Samsung Galaxy S8 64GB Black – 30GB, £30/month (after cashback) with noupfront on EE](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=6224&clickref=TR-S8Deals&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fonehouse.co.uk%2Fshoppingcart.aspx%3Fhtrid%3D167090%26gid%3D0%26colid%3D904%26isnew%3D0%26IsPreOrder%3Dbuy%2520now)Getting a whopping 30GB of data with no upfront cost is one thing, but signingup with EE also gets you three free months of BT Sport plus six months free ofApple Music.

Most people probably won’t notice the difference – andthat’s fine. But I’d suggest hopping into Settings and switching things up.Downscaling can leave some apps with oddly big fonts and a softer look ontexts and icons; considering you’re spending £600/$700+ on a phone, you’llprobably want it to look its best.The Samsung Galaxy S8 is the best phone out there for media binging, and I’vestarted picking it up instead of my iPad when I want to watch something on thego. There’s a clever mode called ‘Video Enhancer’, which boosts the contrastand brightness in certain apps – Netflix, Prime Video, YouTube and so on – togive a pseudo-HDR effect. I wouldn’t recommend keeping it on all the time, dueto the increased battery drain, but it does make a fantastic display evenbetter.**Related:[Best Amazon Prime Day Deals2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-amazon-prime-day-2018-deals-3482743)**[ Next  Performance and Software ](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s8-performance-and-software-page-2)"}
