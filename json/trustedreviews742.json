The aforementioned front ‘selfie cam’ setup is comprised of a\n16-megapixel primary lens and a pair of supporting 2-megapixel lenses.\n\nOn the rear of the device, there’s another, more powerful triple-camera\nconfiguration that pairs a 24-megapixel monochrome lens with a 16-megapixel\ncolour lens and tops it all off with a 16-megapixel ultra-wide angle lens.\nBoth are intriguing layouts, to say the least.\n\nUnder the hood, there’s a top-of-the-line Kirin 980 SoC backed by 6GB of 8GB\nof RAM, and the option of either 128GB or 256GB of on-board storage, while\nkeeping things running is a 3400mAh battery capable of 40W ‘SuperCharge’ fast\ncharging, but not [wireless\ncharging](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/what-is-wireless-\ncharging-3602142).\n\nThere’s no room for a 3.5mm headphone jack, either, as the Honor Magic 2 is\nfitted with just a USB-C port, but there is a new Honor accessory to help you\nget around this in the form of the wireless FlyPods Pro earbuds.\n\nSecurity is handled primarily by an in-display fingerprint scanner, while\nHonor’s new Yoyo digital assistant makes its debut on the software side of\nthings: Honor’s Magic UI 2.0 sitting on top of [Android 9\nPie](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/android-pie).\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nThe Honor Magic 2 will be available in three gradient colours – Red, Blue and\nBlack – and cost Chinese ¥3799 for the 6GB/128GB version, ¥4299 for an\n8GB/256GB configuration, and ¥4799 for the top-end 8GB/256GB model. That’s\nabout £425-£535 depending on which version you opt for, but while pre-orders\nhave started in China ahead of a November 6 release date, there’s no word on\nUK availability at present.\n\nIt’s not a stretch to imagine we’ll see the Magic 2 – or a phone very similar\nto it – launched here, though, as Honor has a history of UK releases. Things\nlook less promising for the US, where Huawei and Honor devices are persona non\ngrata.\n\n**Related:[Best Android phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nandroid-phones-3438996)**\n\nThe Honor Watch, which features 1.2-inch round AMOLED touchscreen, heart-rate\ntracking, and up to seven days of battery life, is pegged to launch globally\nin January 2019 – presumably at CES given the time frame.\n\n**Let us know what you think of the Honor Magic 2 on Twitter\n@TrustedReviews.**\n\n"}
