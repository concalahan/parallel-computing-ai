In Epic’s official complaint (dug up\nby [TorrentFreak](https://torrentfreak.com/images/epic-golden.pdf)) under “The\nDefendants and their Unlawful Acts” the Fortnite developer claims “defendants\nare cheaters” before going big and saying “Nobody likes a cheater. And Nobody\nlikes playing with cheaters.”\n\nThis isn’t Epic’s first swing at cheaters, and they were banning waves of\ncheaters numbering in the thousands throughout 2017, in addition to taking\nover anticheat outfit [Kamu](https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/epic-games-\nacquires-kamu-1202971927/) earlier this month in what appears, externally, to\nbe a bid to beef up their anticheat measures.\n\n**Related:[Best Battle Royale\nGames](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/battle-royale-games-3471487)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe big difference here is that these apparent cheats are cheating to promote\nthe sale of Fortnite PC hacks on Lucas’ website. Currently, none of the\nFortnite hacks are removed from sale, and indeed many of Lucas’ Fortnite have\nalso been pulled down.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nIt’s a big step for Epic, but it seems the logical next step for Epic, who\npreviously levelled several copyright strikes at his YouTube channel, which\nhas 1.7m subscribers.\n\nFramed in the concept of Fortnite’s place as a free to play game, it makes\nsense too. Free to play games largely revolve around the concept of whales,\nwith the many millions of players getting into the game for free and never\npaying anything helping the ecosystem by being willing targets for players who\nhave cash to spare and want to be clad in the latest cosmetics while fighting\ntheir way to a victory royale.\n\nThis doesn’t work if players start cheating, because much like a glue-laden\ncoconut shy or a rigged casino, punters will start to steer clear if they\nthink the game is rigged against them, which will have a major impact on\nEpic’s bottom line.\n\n**Would you cheat in Fortnite?
