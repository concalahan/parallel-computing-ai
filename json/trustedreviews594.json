You may\nremember Mark saying this at OC5: “… when we release the next version of Rift\n— which isn’t this year — all of the content that works for Rift will also\nwork on the next version.” So while we aren’t quite ready to talk about the\nnext version of Rift, PC VR is still a category we are investing in. It’s\nstill a part of our strategy – we’re continuing work across product and\ncontent and you’ll see this manifest next year. Additionally, Nate continues\nto lead the Rift/PC team and there are no changes there.”\n\n**Related:[Oculus Rift 2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/oculus-\nrift-2-release-date-3609895)**\n\n_Original story continues below…_\n\n**Yet another founder of a company acquired by Facebook has quit the social\nnetwork. Oculus co-founder Brendan Iribe is leaving the company, reportedly\nthe result of a decision to cancel the planned Rift 2 headset.**\n\nIribe has confirmed his departure in a Facebook post on Monday, but\n[TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/22/oculus-co-founder-is-leaving-\nfacebook-after-cancellation-of-rift-2-headset/) reports the Iribe and\nFacebook’s top brass had “fundamentally different views on the future of\nOculus that grew deeper over time.”\n\nThe sources said Iribe had grown concerned about a “race to the bottom”\ndesigned to bring as many people into the VR fold as possible, while\ncompromising the priority placed on the highest quality VR experiences.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThe official statement today is much more diplomatic, as it was with Instagram\nco-founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger when they [announced their\ndeparture from the Facebook\nfold](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/instagram-co-founders-leave-\nfacebook-owned-company-3592221) last month.\n\nIn the post, he wrote: “Working alongside so many talented people at Oculus\nand Facebook has been the most transformative experience of my career. We have\na saying when someone compliments or thanks you – “Team effort”.\n\n“The success of Oculus was only possible because of such an extraordinary team\neffort. I’d like to sincerely thank everyone that’s been a part of this\namazing journey, especially Mark for believing in this team and the future of\nVR and AR.”\n\n**Related:[PlayStation VR vs Oculus\nRift](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/playstation-vr-vs-oculus-\nrift-2940361)**\n\nIn a statement to [Venture Beat](https://venturebeat.com/2018/10/22/oculus-\nsays-future-rift-hardware-is-coming-despite-iribes-exit/), Facebook denies a\nsequel to the Rift has been cancelled, but says is isn’t ready to talk about\nthat product yet.\n\nThe firm said: “[W]e aren’t quite ready to talk about the next version of\nRift, but PC VR is still a category we are investing in. It’s still a part of\nour strategy — we’re continuing work across product and content and you’ll see\nthis manifest next year. Additionally, Nate [Mitchell] continues to lead the\nRift/PC team and there are no changes there.”\n\nIribe says he’s going to be taking a break for the first time in 20 years in\norder to prepare for the next stage of his career.\n\nThe departure comes after the launch of the Oculus Go, which was the company’s\nfirst standalone VR headset designed for mid-range virtual reality\nexperiences. The $399 [Oculus\nQuest](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/oculus-quest-price-release-date-\nfeatures-specs-3593210) will bridge the gap between the Go and the original\nRift, but it appears Facebook’s focus on attracting mainstream consumers,\nrather than pushing the performance envelope, has led to the split.\n\nIribe’s departure quickly following that of the Instagram founders represents\na trend among companies Facebook has acquired. WhatsApp founder Brian Action\nleft Facebook last year and even expressed support for the #DeleteFacebook\nmovement following the Cambridge Analytica scandal.\n\nAt least [Facebook has Nick Clegg](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/nick-\nclegg-joins-facebook-3608029) now, huh?\n\n**Should we be reading more into these departures?
