This is a stacked\nphone, packed with three cameras on the back, an [in-display fingerprint\nsensor](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/in-display-fingerprint-scanner-\nmate-20-pro-3605341) and the new, highly-efficient [Kirin\n980](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/kirin-980-features-release-\ndate-3548238) chipset.\n\nIf you absolutely love specs and interesting features then you’re going to\nlove this.\n\n## **Huawei Mate 20 Pro price and release date**\n\nThe Mate 20 Pro launches on October 16 with SIM-free pricing from €1049. In\nthe UK it’ll set you back £899.\n\n**Related:[Best smartphones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nsmartphone-3431175)**\n\n![Huawei Mate 20 Pro\ncamera](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nPick up the Mate 20 Pro and it’s easy to see how far Huawei has come when it\ncomes to design. The P20 Pro was a great phone to look at, but this is even\nbetter. It’s made from glass, with an etched pattern on the back to improve\ngrip. The screen curves ever so slightly and a metal rim sits around the side.\nIt’s finished to perfection and feels as good as an [iPhone\nXS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xs) or [Samsung Galaxy\nS9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9).\n\nIn typical Huawei fashion, there are multiple colours available – including a\ntrippy twilight and lovely, dark forest green – each of which comes with a\ncontrasting power button to add even more visual flair.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\n  * \n\nThere’s no headphone jack (of course), yet it remains IP68 rated for water-\nresistance, and the use of glass means wireless charging has been added.\nHuawei said it wasn’t ready to add this handy feature until it was fast enough\nand apparently this will charge wirelessly at 15w. Considering the [iPhone XS\nMax](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xs-max) tops out at 7.5w,\nthat’s impressive.\n\n**Related:[Huawei Mate 20 first\nlook](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/huawei-mate-20)**\n\nAnother trick is the ability to charge other Qi-enabled phones by pressing\nthem to the back of the Mate 20 Pro. I was charging a Google Pixel 2 XL with\nit and it felt like the future. That was until I held the phones together for\na good 10 minutes and got about 2% extra battery. This might be an idea that\nneeds some tweaking.\n\nSitting on the front of the Mate 20 Pro is a 6.39-inch 2960 x 1440 OLED panel.\nIt’s gorgeous: HDR enabled with fantastically bright colours and a real punch.\nEven the notch can’t disrupt the immersion here.\n\nInside the screen, there’s also a fingerprint sensor. In-display fingerprint\ntech has been rumoured in high-end phones from Apple and Samsung for years and\nhas yet to materialise, but with the Mate 20 Pro it is finally becoming\nmainstream.\n\nSetting it up is very similar to setting up a traditional fingerprint sensor:\nhold your thumb against the screen for a few seconds, moving it around as you\ngo. It’s a tad on the slow side, but once everything is registered you’ll see\na faint fingerprint outline on the display when it’s off.\n\n**Related:[Best Android phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nandroid-phones-3438996)**\n\n![Huawei Mate 20 Pro\nfingerprint](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIt sounds futuristic and it works surprisingly well, even though it’s not\n_quite_ as fast as a physical sensor. Paired with the in-display fingerprint\nsensor is a 24-megapixel 3D depth-sensing camera, hidden in the notch, for\nfacial unlocking. Again, it works fast and seems reliable even on software\nthat isn’t final.\n\nThe biggest downside I can see so far is that because these methods use\nHuawei’s own tech, apps that are normally unlocked via fingerprint (Banking\napps, for example) will simply revert to asking for your pin as these won’t\nwork with the fancy new biometric methods.\n\nInside the Huawei Mate 20 Pro is the Kirin 980, Huawei’s first chipset to use\nthe 7nm architecture. Moving to 7nm from 10nm (this was used in last year’s\n970) helps improve efficiency and allows for better processing and graphics\nwithout sacrificing battery life. The 980 has been paired with 6GB RAM and\n128GB storage.\n\nInside the Kirin 980 sits Huawei’s dual neural engines, which it claims can\nimprove AI processes by 134%. It also helps the phone process video in real-\ntime and add live bokeh effects. Huawei is also touting a general 20% speed\nimprovement across the device, with a 45% boost in graphics and 40% better\nefficiency.\n\nOptics have been a big push for Huawei since it teamed with Leica and if the\nMate 20 Pro manages to better the P20 Pro then this could rival the [Google\nPixel 3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-3) for best\nsmartphone camera this year.\n\nSet out in a square on the back, the Mate 20 Pro packs a 40-megapixel main\ncamera, 8-megapixel telephoto camera for zooming and a new 20-megapixel ultra-\nwide angle camera. Huawei said that due to the quality of the 40-megapixel\nsensor there’s no longer any need for a monochrome camera so we’ve got the\nultra-wide one to replace it.![Huawei Mate 20\nPro](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe impressive long-exposure Night Mode from the P20 returns, as do the bevy\nof aperture-shifting options. You’ve also got a new Macro mode that’ll improve\nclose-up shots.\n\nStabilisation is handled by the Master AI system and that is joined by 4D\npredictive focus to track a subject as you move. I was shown a demonstration\nof someone filming a child running about and the autofocus did an excellent\njob of staying with the subject.\n\nSoftware remains a weak point for Huawei and even though the Mate 20 Pro runs\n[Android 9 Pie](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/android-pie), it still\nvery much retains the Marmite look of EMUI. You do benefit from Pie features\nlike gesture navigation and a Digital Wellbeing section to help curb your\nphone usage, but the general look, feel and UI is still very much Huawei.\n\nHuawei reps were keen to point out it has removed needless options from the\nSettings menu, added more ‘natural sounds’ throughout and improved how quickly\napps open. But if you disliked Huawei’s aggressive approach to skinning\nAndroid before then there isn’t much to change your mind here.\n\n![Huawei Mate 20 Pro\ncamera](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## **Opening Impressions**\n\nYou’ve got to hand it to Huawei. The Mate 20 Pro is the most feature-packed\nphone I have ever used and I love that it’s trying new things. In-display\nfingerprint scanner will likely be the future and there’s something cool –\nthough likely not practical – about helping someone else charge their phone by\nyours acting as the wireless charger.\n\nPair those clever features with an excellent-sounding camera and the speed of\nthe Kirin 980, and you have what could potentially be the best Android phone\nof the year.\n\n"}
