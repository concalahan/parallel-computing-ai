Our guide reveals\nall you need to know to watch Arsenal vs Liverpool online, including full live\nstream details and the kick-off time.**\n\nThe two giants came into this season with very different aims, and they’ve\nboth impressed for different reasons. Jürgen Klopp’s men looks like Man City’s\nmain rivals for the Premier League title, and though their front three haven’t\nquite hit their stride yet, their goalkeeper and back line have improved\nenormously.\n\n**Read more:[Eleven Sports](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/eleven-\nsports-3532011)**\n\nArsenal under new manager Unai Emery, meanwhile, look like a completely\ndifferent beast to the side that continuously underperformed during the final\nfew seasons of Arsene Wenger’s reign. Their winning run may have come to an\nend with a draw at Crystal Palace last weekend, but confidence will still be\nsky-high.\n\nBut can the Gunners turn it on against a top side? They’ve played only two of\ntheir top-four rivals in the Premier League so far this season, and lost on\nboth occasions. Liverpool, on the other hand, have beaten Tottenham and drawn\nagainst Chelsea and Man City.\n\nThe Reds, however, have looked vulnerable at times this season. Before their\nwins over Cardiff and Red Star Belgrade, they struggled to a 1-0 win over\nminnows Huddersfield, were fortunate to hold Man City to a draw, and lost 1-0\nto Napoli − though the scoreline could have been far, far worse.\n\nThere are always goals when these two sides play and, whichever side you’re\non, Arsenal vs Liverpool is the pick of this weekend’s Premier League\nfixtures. Streaming the game could barely be easier, if you’ve got the right\npackage. Here’s how to do it.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n**Read more:[Best VPN](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-vpn-3470328)**\n\n## Arsenal vs Liverpool Live Stream: Kick-off time and how to watch\n\nThe game is scheduled to kick off at 5:30pm GMT on Saturday, November 3, and\nthe match will be shown on TV on BT Sport 1 and BT Sport 4K UHD.
