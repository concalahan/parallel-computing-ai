Also, if you’re intent on picking up the S9 Plus this might throw a\nspanner in the works.\n\nThe good news is we’re on hand to help make the decision-making process a\nlittle easier, as here we’ll run through all the differences between the two\nhandsets.\n\n**Related:[Samsung Galaxy Note 9 vs Galaxy\nS9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-9-vs-\ngalaxy-s9-3527010)**\n\n## Samsung Galaxy Note 9 vs Galaxy S9 Plus Design – Do they look the same?\n\nFront on, the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 looks much like the five-month-old Galaxy\nS9 Plus, with an edge-to-edge screen that’s flanked by a thin bezel. There’s\nalso a front-facing camera, located to the right of the earpiece speaker, as\nwell as an iris scanner that’s housed on the left.\n\n![Samsung Galaxy Note 9 handheld office drawing lifestyle press\nimage](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe most notable differences are on the rear, where a horizontal dual-camera\nresides on the Galaxy Note 9 as opposed to the vertical one on the Galaxy S9\nPlus. Both have a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor beneath the camera setup,\nwhich is made up of the same pair of 12-megapixel sensors and an LED flash.\n\nOn the Note handset’s frame, you’ll find a detachable S Pen (now armed with\nBluetooth) – something the S9 Plus lacks. The rest is much the same: there’s a\n3.5mm headphone jack and loudspeaker along the bottom; a volume rocker on the\nleft; and a dedicated Bixby key and power toggle on the right.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n**Related:[Samsung Galaxy Note 9 vs Galaxy S8\nPlus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-9-vs-\ngalaxy-s8-plus-3526323)**\n\n![Samsung Galaxy Note 9 neck scarf woman drawing press\nimage](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Samsung Galaxy Note 9 vs Galaxy S9 Plus Specs and features – Which is the\nmost powerful?\n\nThe Galaxy Note 9 inches into the lead in the specs department with its\ncolossal 4000mAh battery (the Galaxy S9 Plus has a 3500mAh cell, for\ncomparison).

The only details that separate them is the orientation of\nthe back-mounted camera and the inclusion of an S Pen stylus on the former.\n\nThe Galaxy Note 9 comes top in the specs department with its 4000mAh battery,\nversus the 3500mAh cell on the S9 Plus. The rest of the internals are near-\nidentical to that of the S9 Plus, however, with everything from the Snapdragon\n845 CPU to the 6GB of RAM that drives it matching up.\n\n**Related:[Best Smartphone](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nsmartphone-3431175)**\n\n**Do you like the look of the Galaxy Note 9?
