Here’s\neverything you need to know about the Snapdragon 845, including all the\nSnapdragon 845 phones likely to launch this year.**\n\nSet to feature in the majority of 2018’s flagship devices, like the [Samsung\nGalaxy S9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s9-release-date-\nspecs-features-price-uk-3266552) and [Sony Xperia XZ\nPro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/sony-xperia-xz-pro-release-date-\nprice-design-specs-leak-3373728), the Snapdragon 845 boasts a number of\nimprovements over its predecessor. There’s quicker charging through Quick\nCharge 4+, support for HDR video recording along with hopefully improved\nbattery life.\n\nBut arguably the biggest upgrade will be the performance increases. Faster\nperformance is to be expected with a new chip, but just how much faster is the\nSnapdragon 845 over the 835? Let’s take a look and see.\n\n## **Snapdragon 845 vs 835: Which is faster?**\n\nLast year’s flagship Qualcomm Mobile Platform was the Snapdragon 835, and it\nwas the core of phones like the Pixel 2, Sony Xperia XZ Premium and OnePlus\n5T.\n\nIn the **Geekbench 4** benchmarking test – this is the main benchmarking app\nwe use, testing a phone’s memory and CPU – an 835 device would expect to\nreceive a score of about 6000-6500 in the multi-core test. The **[Pixel\n2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-2) scored 6312** , the\n[**Xperia** ](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sony-xperia-\nxz1)**[XZ1](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sony-xperia-xz1) 6426** and\nthe **[OnePlus 5T](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/oneplus-5t) 6569** ,\n**** for example.\n\nAs there are no actual devices running the 845 just yet – expect these at [MWC\n2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/mwc-2018-news-rumours-dates-preview-\nbarcelona-3372243) – we’ve used a phone built by Qualcomm to get our results.\nWhen using the Geekbench 4 test on this 845 device we picked up scores of\n**between 8395 and 8424 in the multi-core test**. That’s a big improvement,\nbut it’ll be interesting to see what the real world performance is like.\n\nIn the single-core Geekbench 4 test, our pre-production Qualcomm device\nrunning the 845 platform scored **2472** , again that’s a boost over the\n**1917** scored by the Pixel 2.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![iPhone XR](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n###  iPhone XR teardown suggests it’s the best new iPhone for battery life\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-teardown-battery-life-3613465\n\"iPhone XR teardown suggests it’s the best new iPhone for battery life\")\n\n  * [ ![Black Friday 2018](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Black Friday Deals 2018 – Best UK Sales Preview\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-black-friday-2018-deals-2952384\n\"Black Friday Deals 2018 – Best UK Sales Preview\")\n\n  *   * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Colourful new Sonos One speakers get a release date – and a price hike\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/sonos-one-colours-release-date-\nprice-3613447 \"Colourful new Sonos One speakers get a release date – and a\nprice hike\")\n\n  * \n\n**Related:[Best Android phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nandroid-phones)**\n\n![Galaxy S8\ndeal](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Credit: Max Parker – Trusted Reviews**\n\nAnother test we tend to use in our reviews is the Antutu benchmark. Like\nGeekbench 4, this tests the phones memory and CPU but it also looks at the\ngraphics performance. The 845 test device picked up a score of **267,476** in\nAntutu 7.0.4, which is an improved improvement over the 835. The Pixel 2\nscored **203,823** while the [Samsung Galaxy Note 8\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-8)(with an Exynos\n8895) picked up **201,783**\n\nWe also ran some other tests on the Snapdragon 845 test device, including a\nnumber of graphics focussed benchmarks. As you can probably guess, the 845\noutperformed the 835 in each one. See the results below for the full set of\nscores and how it compares to the Pixel 2 and Samsung Galaxy S8 (with an\nExynos processor).\n\n**GFXBench (Car Chase, Manhattan, Manhattan 3.1, T-Rex)**\n\n**Car Chase:** 845 – 22fps | Pixel 2 13fps | Galaxy S8 21fps\n\n**Manhattan 3.1** : 845 – 39fps | Pixel 2 20fps | Galaxy S8 40fps\n\n**Manhattan** : 845 – 54fps | Galaxy S8 54fps | Pixel 2 35fps\n\n**T-Rex** : 845 – 60fps | Galaxy S8 60fps | Pixel 2 60fps\n\n## **Snapdragon 845 vs A11 Bionic (iPhone X, iPhone 8 and 8 Plus)**\n\nComparing Geekbench 4 results from an Android device and one running iOS is of\nlittle use scientifically, but it’s still interesting to see how they both\nfare. In our reviews we have found iOS consistently scores higher than\nAndroid, and in our opinion new iOS devices do perform better than Android\nversions.\n\nIn Geekbench 4 running on an iPhone X we scored **4257** in the single-core\ntest and **10364** in the multi-core. That’s compared to the **8424 and 2472**\nwe scored in GB4 on the Snapdragon 845.\n\nWe’ll have to see just how well the 845 compares to the [A11\nBionic](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-a11-processor-specs-\nperformance-benchmarks-3286346) in real-world use when we get a final device\nin our hands.\n\n**Related:[iPhone X vs iPhone 8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-x-\nvs-iphone-8-3286330)**\n\n![iPhone X vs iPhone 8\nPlus](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Snapdragon 845 Phones: Which flagships are getting the Snapdragon 845?\n\nAs we’ve said, the Snapdragon 845 is likely to feature in the majority of 2018\nAndroid flagships, starting with the Galaxy S9, which is due to launch at MWC\n2018.\n\nLike last year, we expect the S9 to have exclusive rights to the 845 for a\nlittle while – it’s why other big flagships, like the [LG\nG7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-g7-release-date-specs-price-\nrumours-2952060), are going to be absent from the show.\n\nHowever, the Snapdragon 845 will trickle down to other manufacturers, with the\ntop-end of [Sony’s 2018 Xperia\nphones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/new-sony-xperia-\nphones-2018-3367784) also likely to feature the new SoC later in the year,\nalong with the likes of the Huawei P20, [HTC\nU12](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/htc-u12-release-date-price-specs-\nleaks-rumours-3365974) and, come autumn, the [Galaxy Note\n9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-9-release-date-\nprice-specs-rumours-features-3304594).\n\n## **What is the Snapdragon 845 Mobile Platform?**\n\nThe Snapdragon 845 isn’t just a single chip, instead it’s a platform featuring\na number of different components.\n\nThere’s the Adreno 630 GPU, Hexagon 685 DSP, an X20 LTE modem, a Kryo 385 CPU\nplus a Secure Processing Unit.\n\nThe Adreno 630 offers 30% faster graphics and 30% greater power-efficiency,\nplus there’s support for all the latest Vulkan APIs.There should also be a 20%\nboost to CPU power, too.\n\n**Related:[Best smartphones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nsmartphone)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## **Snapdragon 845 Specs and Features: What’s new?**\n\nDuring our time benchmarking the Snapdragon 845 we were repeatedly told that\nthere is more to this than just performance increases and in many ways\nbenchmark scores tell a very small part of the overall story. So what else is\nnew here?\n\n### Snapdragon 845 Mobile VR reference design unveiled\n\nAhead of Mobile World Congress, Qualcomm revealed that it had released a\nSnapdragon 845 Mobile VR reference design. The sample headset will be used by\nthe company’s OEM partners as the basis for upgraded HMDs based on the new-gen\nSoC – a taste of what’s next in the world of mobile VR, in other words.\n\n### Broadcast Audio comes to the Snapdragon 845\n\nAnother very recent announcement saw Qualcomm confirm that phones featuring\nthe Snapdragon 845 will be capable of streaming audio to multiple devices,\nthanks to the addition of the firm’s Broadcast Audio technology. This is a\nsmall but significant bit of news, as it means that this year’s crop of\npremium Snapdragon 845 handsets will ship ready for one-to-many Bluetooth\nstreaming – and software updates for a number of its other SoCs mean select\nolder devices will also get these capabilities.\n\n### **Improved camera with single-sensor bokeh**\n\nQualcomm spent a lot of the time during the announcement of the Snapdragon 845\ntalking up how it’s going to improve the photos taken by smartphones that use\nit.\n\nThe 845 supports single-sensor bokeh – just like the [Google Pixel\n2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-2) and 2 XL – giving\nyou that shallow depth of field effect without needing two sensors on the back\nof the phone. We’ve already seen how well the Pixel 2 emulates the bokeh\neffect, so it’ll be interesting to see how well Qualcomm’s Spectra 280 ISP\nhandles it.\n\nQualcomm also claimed that it hopes to power phones in 2018 that’ll break 100\npoint barrier in the DxOMark camera benchmarks.\n\n### **Ultra HD Premium recording with 10-bit colour and HDR**\n\nAnother big upgrade for the camera is full support for video recording at the\nUltra HD Premium level – this means you’ll be able to capture high dynamic\nrange (HDR), 4K footage at 60fps with 10-bit colour.\n\n![PanasonicUHDPremium](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThis wider colour depth and gamut will add much more lifelike colours to your\nvideos and the demos we were shown on stage certainly seemed to show this. The\nRec 20.20 colour gamut is supported, as is slow-motion capture at 480fps in\n720p.\n\n### **Better security for your biometrics and support for Face Unlock**\n\nApple ditched the fingerprint scanner completely with the [iPhone\nX](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-x) and while Qualcomm clearly\nisn’t seeing this as the future for everyone yet, it’s still adding support\nfor face unlock with the 845.\n\nThere’s also much improved security for all your biometrics – fingerprint,\nvoice and iris – with a secure processing unit that’ll house all your data.\n\n### **Improved connectivity options**\n\nInside the Snapdragon 845 is the new X20 LTE modem – this is the second-\ngeneration gigabit LTE modem from Qualcomm with a 20% increase in peak and\nreal world performance.\n\nThere’s support for dual VoLTE sims in a single phone and Qualcomm has added\nsome proprietary elements to Bluetooth 5 that’ll be able to send content to\nmultiple devices. This should help battery life on truly-wireless earbuds, as\nit’ll be able to send the music to both earbuds rather than to a single one.\n\n### **Better battery life life and quicker charging**\n\nDuring the presentation Qualcomm said that the number one feature people want\nin their phones is good battery life. So, with the Snapdragon 845, it’s making\nsome improvements to help endurance.\n\nIt didn’t go into too much detail regarding the improvements, but it did claim\nthe following:\n\n  * Continuous UHD 4K capture video for 4+ hours\n  * 3+ hours of continuous VR gameplay\n  * 2+ days of Ultra HD Voice\n\nThere was also the aforementioned [Quick Charge\n4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/what-is-qualcomm-quick-charge-4-best-\nfeatures-explained-2950561), which was originally launched with the Snapdragon\n835 last year. There hasn’t been much adoption of QC 4 yet, [Razer\nPhone](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/razer-phone) aside, but\nhopefully that’ll change in 2018. Qualcomm said you’ll be able to go from\n0-50% with just a 15 minute charge and it’s a compatible superset of USB-C PD\n(power delivery) so you can use a supported charger to charge all your USB-C\ndevices.\n\n## Snapdragon 845 Release Date: When did the Snapdragon 845 get revealed?\n\nQualcomm officially unveiled the Snapdragon 845 in December 2017, when\n_Trusted Reviews_ joined the semiconductor giant in Hawaii for its annual\nSnapdragon Tech Summit.\n\nWe subsequently ventured to its San Diego, California headquarters to\nbenchmark the 845 in February 2018, while the first Snapdragon 845 phones will\nbreak cover at MWC 2018 in Barcelona.\n\n_**Are you excited about the Snapdragon 845 and phones that’ll use it?
