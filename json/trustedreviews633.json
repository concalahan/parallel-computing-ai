Located on the opposite\nside of the ship where you spawn, it can be found on a raised platform after\nclimbing some stairs.\n\nIf you’re really having trouble, characters will remark on the artifact’s\nwhereabouts in dialogue once it comes into your field of vision.

We’ve listed the\nlocations of all four of them below to make things easier.\n\n**First Symbol –** The first one can be found on Poop Deck shortly after\ncollecting the artifact. It’s difficult to miss, especially since you’ll need\nto walk right past it to leave the area.\n\n**Second Symbol –** This can be found at the Grand Staircase. More\nspecifically, head right to the bottom and it will be right in your sights.\n\n**Third Symbol –** Make your way to the Cargo Hold and head underwater just\npast the Mail Rooms, which is behind a door right where you spawn. Venture\nthrough the water-ridden room and you’ll find it waiting for you.\n\n**Fourth Symbol –** The fourth and final pedestal is located in the Turbine\nRoom. For this you’ll need to briefly venture underwater before coming across\na large, metallic turbine.\n\n**Related:[Best PS4 Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nps4-games-3431751)**\n\n![Voyage of Despair Tips and\nTricks](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Black Ops 4: Voyage of Despair Guide – How to activate the Pack a Punch\nMachine\n\nNow all of the pedestals have been activated you will have transformed the\nPoop Deck where the original artifact was found. Now, you’ll be staring at a\nready and waiting Pack a Punch Machine, although you’ll need to surrender 5000\npoints to upgrade any of your weapons.\n\n## Black Ops 4: Voyage of Despair Guide – How to unlock the Kraken Weapon\n\nThis particular weapon can be unlocked through the mystery box, but some\nplayers won’t want to leave such a supremely powerful tool to chance if\nthey’re hoping to reach the higher rounds in Voyage of Despair. So, we’ve\ncompiled a quick guide below to help you out.\n\n**Kraken – Step 1:** Once Stoker enemies begin spawning, concentrate fire on\ntheir glowing spots until it is defeated. If done right, they’ll drop a key.\n\n**Kraken – Step 2:** Next up you’ll need to go on a journey across the Titanic\nin search of four unique chests. Their locations are as follows: Provisions\nRoom, Mail Room, Galley, Turbine Room.\n\n**Kraken – Step 3:** Upon finding a chest, use the key to open it and begin\nbutchering the undead to fill them with required souls. Just make sure you’re\nstanding close enough!\n\n**Kraken – Step 4:** The location of the chest will change with each\nsubsequent collection of souls, so keep that in mind and split up your team\naccordingly.\n\n**Kraken – Step 5:** Once you’ve done this three times, one of two items will\nspawn out of the chest. Which is it will determine the spawn location of the\nKraken. A compass means the Top Deck, while a Telescope takes you down to the\nPoop Deck.\n\n**Related:[Upcoming Xbox One\nGames](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/upcoming-xbox-one-\ngames-2018-3531040)**\n\n![Voyage of Despair Tips and\nTricks](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Black Ops 4: Voyage of Despair Guide – General Tips and Tricks\n\n**Be wary of tight spaces**\n\nThe Titanic is a massive ship, but the Voyage of Despair has accurately\ndepicted it as one with an assortment of tight, complicated spaces that\nzombies will have no problem getting the jump on you inside. So be careful,\nwatch your corners, and perhaps keep a shotgun handy for close encounters.\n\nOpening areas in this map are a maze of winding staircases and labyrinthine\ncorridors each hiding their own secrets. Sadly, these are complimented by\nthreats that can down you in seconds if you’re not careful. Depend on your\nteammates and don’t venture too far on your own, otherwise you’re toast.\n\n**Don’t be ashamed of bots**\n\nIf you’re playing alone or don’t have any friends jumping on the Zombies\nbandwagon, the new implementation of bots in Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 is a\ngenuine saving grace. They’re shockingly intelligent, and won’t hesitate to\nopen doors and seek out things you might not even be aware of.\n\nYou can determine how many bots you play with if you’re afraid of feeling\noverpowered or would rather fend for yourself, but they offer a helpful sense\nof co-operation that, despite the name, doesn’t feel entirely robotic. That,\nand reaching later rounds on your lonesome isn’t exactly easy.\n\n**Use your teleporters.**\n\nMuch like in Blood of the Dead, once you’ve collected certain items you’ll\ngain access to a series of teleportation methods locations across the map.\nThese become increasingly invaluable as the zombie hordes grow in size and\ncapabilities. At times you’ll have dozens chasing after you, and teleporters\nare the get out of jail free cards you’ll need.\n\nTransporting yourself from one end of the map to another in a few short\nseconds provides you with moments of breathing room you might need to heal\nyourself or purchase weapons and ammunition. However, the undead are on their\nway, so don’t think you’re safe for too long.\n\n**How far have you gotten in Voyage of Despair? Let us know on Facebook and\nTwitter @trustedreviews.**\n\n"}
