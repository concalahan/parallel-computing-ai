We went along to the O2 Centre in London to try it out for\nourselves.\n\nVR is exhausting. The headsets are heavy, claustrophobic and sweaty, and\nstanding up was always going to be more effort than sitting on a nice comfy\nsofa, but the biggest drain is the exhilaration of the games themselves.\n\nFighting aliens across the battlefields of Farpoint or exploring underground\ncaves in the zombie wastelands of Arizona Sunshine is an intense experience.\nIt’s psychologically exhausting to have your brain tricked into telling you\nthat monsters are constantly inches away from murdering you, and although VR\ngames are getting longer and longer as developers get better at making (and\nfinancing) them, I could never spend the same amount of time in a headset as I\ndo staring at a TV.\n\nA preference for short, sharp pieces of action means that, increasingly, the\narcade feels like the perfect home for high-end virtual reality experiences,\nand Mario Kart VR is a perfect example. It might only be three and a half\nminutes long, but the combination of hand-tracking, force-feedback from both\nthe wheel and seat, and of course virtual reality, means that it feels far\nlonger.\n\n## A made for the arcade Mario\n\nIt’s important to realise that this isn’t a complete, full-fat Mario Kart\nexperience. Like the other arcade games based on the series, Mario Kart VR is\nan experience developed by Bandai Namco with Nintendo having provided little\nbeyond the rights to the license in the first place.\n\nAfter its release in Japan last year, the game has now made its way to the UK\nwhere it’s available to play in the Hollywood Bowl in London’s O2 Centre from\ntoday, and will be expanding to locations in Milton Keynes and Leeds later in\nthe year.\n\nMario Kart has never exactly been a realistic simulation of real-world\ndriving, but this release simplifies things even further. Rather than picking\ntracks, you’re treated to a greatest hits compilation of recognisable settings\nfrom the series, and your choice of character comes down to just four (Mario,\nLuigi, Princess Peach and Yoshi) which you’re assigned based on which of the\nfour chairs you’re sitting in.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nEven the racing itself is streamlined. There’s none of the drifting and\nboosting you’ll be used to from the console games, and you can forget about\nslip-streaming behind other players to gain additional speed.\n\nSo it’s simplified, but considering this is a game you’ll play once or twice\nrather than every day on your commute (thanks Mario Kart 8 Deluxe), that’s\nmaybe not the worst thing in the world.\n\nWhen it comes to the power-ups, Bandai Namco has made the best possible\ndeviation from the core game thanks to HTC’s Vive Trackers, the small\nstandalone tracking devices that let you turn anything into a VR controller.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nA pair of Vive Trackers keeps track of your hands.\n\nIn this instance, what’s being turned into a controller are your hands\nthemselves. The tracking hardware isn’t the sleekest thing we’ve ever seen,\nand their bulk can make holding the steering wheel a little uncomfortable.\nThat said, what they add to the experience is fantastic.\n\nRather than hitting the floating question blocks that traditionally litter\nMario Kart’s tracks, Mario Kart VR sees powerups strung up from balloons that\nfloat alongside you. You don’t drive into them, you reach out and grab them\nwith your hand.\n\n## Motion-controlled mayhem\n\nThis is where things get interesting. Instead of just hitting a button to\nthrow a powerup forward, you’ll fling it physically using your hand. There are\nno buttons on the tracker (so you don’t have to worry too much about timing\nyour throw) but when your body’s being thrown too and fro in a force-feedback\ngo kart it’s surprisingly difficult to land an accurate shot.\n\nWe counted three power-ups during our time with the game; the traditional\ngreen shell and banana skin, and a hammer which can be used to squash other\nplayers in your immediate vicinity — an apparent exclusive for the arcade\nversion of the game.\n\nThey’re all power ups that work remarkably well with motion controls. Sure, it\nwould be cool to see more items like the ink-spraying Blooper or the shrink-\nray Thunderbolt, but we can’t see these having quite the same motion-\ncontrolled appeal.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe comparatively low-res HTC Vive headsets had us hankering after a Vive Pro\n\nThere’s a lot of hardware being used in this experience, to the extent that it\nwould be almost impossible to put a similar setup together at home. Taking\ninto account the Vive Trackers, the force-feedback kart and even the HTC Vive\nheadsets themselves (sadly there was no sight of the upgraded HTC Vive Pro\nmodels in use), you’re easily looking at a setup that costs thousands, an\nabsurd amount of money to spend on the small number of games that would\nsupport it.\n\nAt a price of £7.99 per person (or £24.99 for a group of four), the three and\na half minute Mario Kart VR is about the same price as a cheap cinema ticket.\nIt’s cheaper than Secrets of the Empire, the Star Wars experience from The\nVoid that was the last high-profile VR experience to come to London which cost\nan eye-watering £32. Then again, it was also half an hour long.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nDespite the headsets having been available to buy for a couple of years now,\nVR is still a novelty, and novelties carry price premiums.\n\nAs someone who gets to use VR equipment fairly regularly for work, £7.99 feels\na little expensive to me, but compared to the hundreds you’d have to spend to\ntry it out as a consumer it feels like an absolute steal.\n\nWith each VR arcade experience I try out I become more and more convinced that\nexperiences like this are the future of VR. Arcades have the space to make the\nmost of experiences like this, and they have a constant stream of customers to\njustify the cost of the hardware.\n\nAll they need now is the games, and Mario Kart VR is a great example of how to\nadapt a classic franchise into the realm of virtual reality.\n\n**How much would you pay to play Mario Kart in virtual reality?
