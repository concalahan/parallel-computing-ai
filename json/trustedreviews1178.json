Series\n2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-watch-2-release-date-rumours-\nprice-news-battery-life). This packed in a new GPS sensor as well as\nwaterproofing to 50m and a new dual-core Apple S2 SiP chip to power\neverything. The new Series 2 will be available for £369. _\n\nInterestingly, Apple is keeping the original Apple Watch around – and renaming\nit the [Apple Watch Series 1](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-watch-\ngets-a-new-name-new-cpu-and-a-smaller-price-tag). The big surprise is that the\nApple Watch Series 1 is getting a performance upgrade in the form of that very\nsame S2 chip. This chip promises 50% improved CPU performance and double the\ngraphics performance over the original. The new Apple Watch Series 1 will\nretail for a more budget-friendly £269, too. So if you don’t need the extra\nsports-friendly functions of the Series 2, it could be a great shout\nespecially once watchOS 3 releases. __\n\nOur original Apple Watch review, including a long-term update, continue below.  \n **  \nRelated:[Apple Watch Series 2 vs Apple Watch Series 1: What’s new and should\nyou upgrade?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/apple-watch-vs-apple-\nwatch-2)** _  \n_\n\n## Apple Watch – Long-term review\n\nI’ve been wearing Apple’s first wearable since it hit shelves last spring and\nin most ways my opinion almost entirely mirrors our initial review. Once\nyou’ve looked past the typically stylish Apple design, the Watch is an overly\ncomplicated piece of tech that still doesn’t really know what it wants to be.\n\nIn fact, the best move I’ve made so far is to completely turn off all\nnotifications. The constant wrist vibrations became a nuisance, not aid, on\ntoo many occasions. Silencing them is the only reason I’ve been able to keep\nthe Watch on this long. Maybe smartwatches aren’t meant to be hubs for all our\ncommunications after all.\n\nEven though watchOS 2 was meant to sort out the ridiculously slow app\nsituation with native downloads, it’s still far from perfect. Apps still take\nan age to get going and they’re still mostly pointless. Aside from the handy\nmusic controls and fairly impressive Citymapper there isn’t much else that has\nmade me think, ‘Wow, this really works on a watch.’\n\nWatchOS 2 did bring with it a few neat upgrades. The Nightclock feature is\nnice to have, though I wish I could keep it on all the time, like I can on the\n[Moto 360 2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/moto-360-2-review \"Moto 360 2\nreview\"). And don’t even try using it with the Milanese Loop strap, you need a\ntough one like the Sport Band to keep it upright.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![iPhone XR](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### iPhone XR teardown suggests it’s the best new iPhone for battery life\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-teardown-battery-life-3613465\n\"iPhone XR teardown suggests it’s the best new iPhone for battery life\")\n\n  * [ ![Black Friday 2018](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Black Friday Deals 2018 – Best UK Sales Preview\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-black-friday-2018-deals-2952384\n\"Black Friday Deals 2018 – Best UK Sales Preview\")\n\n  *   * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Colourful new Sonos One speakers get a release date – and a price hike\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/sonos-one-colours-release-date-\nprice-3613447 \"Colourful new Sonos One speakers get a release date – and a\nprice hike\")\n\n  * \n\nTime Travel, which lets you skip through the day by twiddling the Digital\nCrown, is great too.

These\ninclude common issues, such as poor battery life, as well as more local\nproblems, like weird software glitches and unintuitive app interfaces.  \n **[](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/pebble-time-vs-apple-watch)**  \n **Watch our Apple Watch vs iPhone race across London**\n\n**Related:[Apple Watch 2 release\ndate](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-watch-2-release-date-rumours-\nprice-news-battery-life)**\n\n## Apple Watch – Design and Comfort\n\nThe Apple Watch is the most attractive smartwatch by a country mile. It uses\nthe most luxurious materials and it’s more discreet and elegant than the\nmajority of its rivals. That’s the least we expected from Apple and from\nsomething that costs more than the alternatives, though.\n\nThe casing, which is made from stainless steel, has a lovely polished sheen,\nwhile ceramic glass protects the heart rate sensor on the back. The Watch is\nbeautifully constructed, though the Watch complements a smart shirt better\nthan something more casual. Much of this comes down to the version and strap\nyou choose, though, which we’ll get into in a minute.  \n **  \nTrustedReviews Awards 2015:[Winners\nannounced](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/trustedreviews-awards-2015-all-\nthe-winners-revealed)**\n\nFirst, an important question – it’s a beautiful smartwatch, but is it a\nbeautiful watch in the traditional sense? Not really. A normal £600 watch\ndoesn’t have to live with the compromises that most smartwatches, including\nthe Watch, have to deal with and that shows. Pick up a similarly priced Nixon,\na Seiko or Hamilton watch and you’ll instantly see what we’re talking about.\n\n**SEE ALSO:[Best Fitness Trackers](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-\nfitness-tracker_round-up)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nApple does live with those compromises better than most, though, specifically\nthat issue of thickness. The Apple Watch isn’t thin. It’s about as thick as\nthree British one pound coins (11.5mm thick to be precise), but you don’t\nnotice the added bulk as much as some. The way the stainless steel case and\nscreen curve inwards help create the illusion of a slimmer, more elegant\ntimepiece compared to the Moto 360, which many feel is the most desirable\nAndroid Wear watch to date. It also helps that the Digital Crown and Friends\nbutton on the right don’t jut out too far, while you’ll barely notice the\nspeaker and mic on the left that let you make and take calls.\n\nThat thick body fits in an array of components, including 8GB of flash memory,\nthe NFC radios ready for Apple Pay (US-only for now), sensors for tracking\nmotion and Apple’s custom S1 processor. That’s accompanied by 512MB RAM and\nthe whole chipset setup is supposedly more powerful than the first generation\niPad.\n\nSo far, so good, but it’s a little disappointing that the Apple Watch isn’t\nreally waterproof. You’ll have to take it off before you get in the shower and\ndon’t even think about going anywhere near a swimming pool. Apple says it\nmeets the IPX7 water resistant certification, which means it’s suitable for\nrunning in the rain and doing the dishes with it on.  \n **  \nSEE ALSO:[Samsung Gear S2 vs Apple Watch: Do you go Apple or Samsung\nsmartwatch?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/samsung-gear-s2-vs-apple-\nwatch)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThere’s no shortage of strap options. Apple is offering a variety of leather,\nmetal and more sport-friendly rugged straps with different types of buckles.\nIt’s easy to remove and change them by locating and holding down the buttons\non the back of the case to slide out the watch strap.\n\nWe had the Milanese loop strap, which is the most jewellery-like in\nappearance. It complements the stainless steel body nicely, but it’s a little\nmore feminine than the leather options. Unclip it and wear it around your\nwrist and you’ll see what we mean. Its magnetic clasp makes it easy to secure\nand means there’s no need to remove links to find that perfect fit. It’s not\nfree from issues, though. The clasp has already picked up a fair few\nscratches, so it’s clearly not the most durable strap in the range.\n\nIt is very comfortable, though, as is the Watch as a whole – it feels fine\neven when worn all day and night. It’s technically a little heavier than other\nsmartwatches, but you’ll barely notice the extra weight. Thankfully, it’s\nelegant stature means it doesn’t stick out like a sore thumb and we’ve had no\nskin irritation issues during our time using it.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Apple Watch – Screen\n\nIf there’s something smartwatch manufacturers are not struggling with, it’s\nhow to make great small screens. LG and Samsung lead the way, but that’s no\nsurprise when they’ve been excelling doing the same for phones and TVs for\nsome time now.\n\nThe Watch we tested with the 42mm strap packs a 1.7-inch rectangular screen,\nwhich is bigger than the one used on the Watch with the smaller 38mm strap\n(1.5-inch). Apple is calling it a Retina Display, but unlike an iPhone, it’s\nswapped LCD technology for an LG-built flexible OLED one.\n\nOn top lies a sapphire crystal coating, something you’d find on a similarly\npriced Nixon watch for instance. This is included to protect against\nscratches. It’s also meant to increase reflectivity, but that’s not something\nyou’ll find an issue with on the Watch. The cheap Watch Sport has to settle\nfor toughened glass.\n\nFrom a design perspective, the Watch screen is a beauty. There’s no obvious\nthick, ugly screen bezel, so all of that screen estate is dedicated to\naccommodating the operating system. Apple has hidden away the ambient light\nsensor – responsible for automatically dimming brightness – behind the screen,\nwhich is rather clever.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe rectangular versus circular screen debate continues to divide and we’d\nstill side with the more traditional approach. But the Apple Watch is the most\nconvincing argument for a ‘smartphone inspired’ screen on a phone.\n\nThe 1.7-inch screen has 322 pixels per inch and it’s right up there with the\nSamsung Gear Live for sharpness, colour accuracy and brightness. Whites have a\nslight blueish tint, but it’s virtually impossible to notice on such a small\nscreen. Visibility is fantastic, as well. Day or night, you won’t have to\nsquint to read it and it copes well in bright sunlight.\n\nAnother aspect of the screen is Force Touch – it’s one of the most interesting\nfeatures on the Watch. It essentially forms part of the screen technology and\nmakes it possible to detect the difference between light and hard presses on\nthe screen. There’s nothing really like it on other smartwatches and while it\ntakes some playing around to work out the apps compatible with it, it’s a\nclever way to add extra functionality to apps without having to over\ncomplicate the user interface or add more physical buttons.\n\nWe’d say Samsung’s smartwatch screens remain the pinnacle, but Apple’s not too\nfar behind for overall quality.\n\n[ Next  \nSoftware & Using the Watch ](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/apple-\nwatch-software-using-the-watch-page-2)\n\n"}
