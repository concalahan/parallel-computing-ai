{"result": 0, "title": "Samsung Galaxy S9 review: Small upgrades, big difference", "description": "*   * ![Samsung Galaxy S9 front]()There’s full support for mobile HDR10 and the S9 can stream HDR content fromsources such as Netflix and Amazon Prime. This provides movies and TV showswith better contrast and enables them to use a wider gamut of colours. Watch aprogramme that features numerous dark scenes, such as _Altered Carbon_ , andyou’ll notice the difference right away. This is far from the first phone toboast HDR support, but I haven’t yet seen a phone display it as well.A blue light filter mode makes this super-bright screen much better forviewing before you sleep by turning everything orange. This can be scheduledto automatically turn on each night.### Virgin Media Business Deal[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7193&awinaffid=!!!277673!!!&clickref=tr-virginmediabusiness&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.virginmediabusiness.co.uk%2Fconnectivity%2Fbusiness-mobile%2Fdevices%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s9-plus%2Fbroadband-and-mobile-awin%2F%3FCMP%3Dadi_affil-mar-0001820_digital-4378%20)[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7193&awinaffid=!!!277673!!!&clickref=tr-virginmediabusiness&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.virginmediabusiness.co.uk%2Fconnectivity%2Fbusiness-mobile%2Fdevices%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s9-plus%2Fbroadband-and-mobile-awin%2F%3FCMP%3Dadi_affil-mar-0001820_digital-4378%20)###[Voom Fibre 3 Business Broadband + Samsung Galaxy S9+ w/ 32GB of data](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7193&awinaffid=!!!277673!!!&clickref=tr-virginmediabusiness&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.virginmediabusiness.co.uk%2Fconnectivity%2Fbusiness-mobile%2Fdevices%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s9-plus%2Fbroadband-and-mobile-awin%2F%3FCMP%3Dadi_affil-mar-0001820_digital-4378%20)You can save £25 a month when signing up for Voom Fibre 3 Business Broadbandwith a superb Samsung Galaxy S9+ and generous 32GB of data.[Virgin Media Business](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7193&awinaffid=!!!277673!!!&clickref=tr-virginmediabusiness&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.virginmediabusiness.co.uk%2Fconnectivity%2Fbusiness-mobile%2Fdevices%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s9-plus%2Fbroadband-and-mobile-awin%2F%3FCMP%3Dadi_affil-mar-0001820_digital-4378%20)[ViewDeal](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7193&awinaffid=!!!277673!!!&clickref=tr-virginmediabusiness&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.virginmediabusiness.co.uk%2Fconnectivity%2Fbusiness-mobile%2Fdevices%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s9-plus%2Fbroadband-and-mobile-awin%2F%3FCMP%3Dadi_affil-mar-0001820_digital-4378%20)[Virgin Media Business](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7193&awinaffid=!!!277673!!!&clickref=tr-virginmediabusiness&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.virginmediabusiness.co.uk%2Fconnectivity%2Fbusiness-mobile%2Fdevices%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s9-plus%2Fbroadband-and-mobile-awin%2F%3FCMP%3Dadi_affil-mar-0001820_digital-4378%20)Viewing angles are good, as is outdoor visibility, but you’ll notice a slightblue shift along the curved edges of the display. This is one of the downsidesof OLED; you’ll see it on most phones using the tech. Samsung’s displays dodeal with the issue far better than those produced by LG – and used on theGoogle Pixel 2 – and you’ll really only notice the blue if you go looking forit.**Related:[OnePlus 6TReview](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/oneplus-6t)**[ Next  Performance and Software ](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9-performance-and-software)"}
