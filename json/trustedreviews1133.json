The ending **(spoilers)** of\n[Uncharted 4: A Thief’s\nEnd](https://www.trustedreviews.com/uncharted-4-review) literally had our\nwind-swept hero sailing into the sunset with Elena Fisher and their lovely\ndaughter. However, it did leave a few doors open for a potential sequel, many\nof which we’d love to see materialise in the coming years.\n\nNaughty Dog is currently hard at work on [The Last of Us Part\n2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/the-last-of-us-2-release-date-gameplay-\ntrailer-pre-order-news-wishlist), but we can still think about what we want\nfrom Uncharted 5, and its potential release date.\n\n_TrustedReviews_ has put together our own personal wishlist of what we’d love\nto see about Uncharted 5, we’ll be updating this page with new info as and\nwhen the game is officially announced along with any trailers, gameplay info\nand more, so be sure to bookmark the page!\n\n**Related:[PS4 Pro vs Xbox One X](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/xbox-\none-x-vs-ps4-pro-2993235)**\n\n**[![Uncharted\n4](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/xbox-one-x-vs-\nps4-pro-2993235)**\n\n## What is Uncharted 5?\n\nWe don’t know! Honestly, we wouldn’t be surprised if it doesn’t even surface\non PS4 at all. If it is developed by Naughty Dog, Uncharted 5 will almost\ncertainly capture the same level of action, charm and platforming prowess\nprevious games have dealt in spades. Could it be a PS5 launch title? It would\ncertainly make sense to kick off Sony’s next console with one of its strongest\nIPs. **  \n**  \nDespite its ending, A Thief’s End actually opens up plenty of avenues for\nfuture instalments. Now, time to dig into what we’d love to see.\n\n**Related:[Upcoming PS4 Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/upcoming-\nps4-games_round-up)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n###  Best food processor 2018 – chop, slice and blend automatically\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-food-processor-2018-chop-slice-and-\nblend-automatically-3612124 \"Best food processor 2018 – chop, slice and blend\nautomatically\")\n\n  * [ ![Google Home Hub YouTube](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Will Google Home Hub ever get Netflix?

He’s pretty much\nretired now, so his position as a quick-witted treasure hunter is ripe for the\ntaking.\n\nIf you’ve finished A Thief’s End, you’ll know the epilogue has us taking\ncontrol of his daughter, Cassie Drake. She’s smart, adventurous and\ninquisitive, all the qualities a mass-murdering explorer needs in Uncharted.\n\nOn paper, she seems like the perfect heroine to pick up the torch Nathan Drake\nso graciously left behind. She’d also give Lara Croft a run for her money when\nit comes to raiding tombs and busting bad guys.\n\n## Build upon the Uncharted formula\n\nA Thief’s End and The Last of Us have shown that Naughty Dog is capable of\ncrafting more than your typical action adventure. The studio has produced\nunforgettable characters alongside a gameplay formula that grows in complexity\nwith each iteration.\n\nUncharted’s fourth entry saw the introduction of vast open environments\nalongside combat encounters that could be approached using force, stealth or\ncomplete avoidance when executed correctly. The next entry should build upon\nthis with further refinements and new additions. A new protagonist would more\nthan justify these changes, too. It’d be boring if everything felt like a\ncarbon copy of Nathan Drake’s repertoire.\n\n**Related:[Best PS4\nGames](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/ps4-games-3431751)**\n\n![Uncharted\n4](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\n## Story still comes first\n\nThe Uncharted series has always received a lot of flack for its storytelling.\nIt might be simple, but the character work and dialogue is almost\nunparalleled. It’s essentially Indiana Jones in gaming form and isn’t trying\nto be anything more than that. Uncharted 5 should continue this streak with an\nall-new narrative and cast to work with. Lightning doesn’t strike twice, but\nwe’re sure Naughty Dog is capable of capturing the same sense of playful magic\nonce again.\n\n## Improved multiplayer\n\nUncharted 4’s multiplayer was a surprisingly solid affair and continues to be\nsupported to this day with new maps, modes and skins for players to enjoy.\nNaughty Dog should try its very best to continue this trend while expanding\nits online offerings. By translating the mixture of gunplay and traversal to a\nmultiplayer arena, A Thief’s End kept things fresh without losing what we love\nabout Nathan Drake’s solo escapades. Of course, it could always be improved.\nWe’d love to see co-operative campaigns from past titles make a return.\nWorking together with your friends toward a common goal was an absolute\nthrill.\n\n**_Do you want to see Uncharted 5?
