It’s Huawei’s equivalent [iPhone\n8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-8) to the beefier [iPhone\nXS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xs).\n\nThere’s a 5.8-inch notched LCD, Huawei’s AI-enhanced Kirin 970 processor, a\ndual rear camera, the latest EMUI 8.1 Android overlay and much more. The P20\nis no slouch, even if stiff competition might render it a touch behind the\ncurve already.\n\n**Related:[Best phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nsmartphone-3431175)**\n\n## Huawei P20 – Design\n\nThe P20’s design is a stylish evolution of the glass-backed, metal-framed form\nwe encountered on last year’s [Mate\n10](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/huawei-mate-10) and [Mate 10\nPro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/huawei-mate-10-pro). In the case\nof the vanilla P20, you lose out on the Pro’s third rear camera, but aside\nfrom size, the phones essentially look identical.\n\n**Related:[Huawei Mate 20 Pro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/huawei-\nmate-20-pro)**\n\nThe metal frame is polished to a near-mirror shine and coated to complement\nthe colourway you choose. The most eye-catching option is a blue/purple\ngradient called ‘Twilight’ but whilst it’s the most popular finish on the Pro,\nit’s harder to find the standard P20 in this shade. In the UK, the phone is\nmore readily available in black, Midnight Blue or Pink Gold (pictured).\n\nDespite packing in the same-sized screen, the P20’s narrower waistline and\ntaller overall footprint render it slimmer and more svelte in the hand than\nthe likes of Apple’s iPhone X. Beware, though: that polished metal and glass\nbody is a little slippery, so handle with care if you don’t plan to pop the\ndevice into a case.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Call of Cthulhu](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Call of Cthulhu\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/call-of-cthulhu \"Call of Cthulhu\")\n\n  * [ ![iPad Pro 2018](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: MySmartPrice / @OnLeaks \n\n### New iPad Pro 2018 leak shows Apple is almost certainly dropping the Home\nbutton\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ipad-pro-2018-release-date-specs-\nprice-3482812 \"New iPad Pro 2018 leak shows Apple is almost certainly dropping\nthe Home button\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Pete Lau on stage at the OnePlus 6T launch](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### The OnePlus 6T ditched the headphone jack, CEO Pete Lau tells us why\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ceo-pete-lau-oneplus-6t-headphone-jack-\nwireless-charging-3612475 \"The OnePlus 6T ditched the headphone jack, CEO Pete\nLau tells us why\")\n\n  * \n\n![Huawei\nP20](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2018/03/IMG_20180409_152314.jpg)\n\nHuawei has done a decent job of pushing that 5.8-inch display to the edges of\nthe phone’s front. However, for some reason, it has chosen to cram a narrow\nfingerprint sensor into what little bezel remains beneath the display. Why the\nsensor couldn’t reside on the back, as it does on the P20 Lite, is unclear. I\nfound the placement on the P20 to make far less sense ergonomically.\n\nRunning around the edge of the P20 is a tactile metal hardware power key and\nvolume rocker along the right side, with dual grilles housing a microphone and\nloudspeaker respectively either side of a USB-C port.\n\nWith regards to audio, unlike the P20 Pro, the standard model only pushes\nsound out of this single loudspeaker, leaving the earpiece for phone calls\nonly. Not only does this mean mono audio, but the placement means I found\nmyself occasionally covering it with my palm when holding the phone one-\nhanded, and when in a landscape orientation.\n\n**Related:[Best Wireless\nHeadphones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/wireless-headphones-\nbluetooth-3450127)**\n\n![Huawei\nP20](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2018/03/Huawei-P20-4.jpg)\n\nYou may also notice that I’ve made no mention of a headphone jack and that’s\nbecause there isn’t one. Instead, you’ll have to use Bluetooth buds or live\nthat dongle life (there’s one in-box).\n\n**Related:[Best Android Phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nandroid-phones-3438996)**\n\n### Best Huawei P20 Deals\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=6506&clickref=TR-\nHuaweiP20&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metrofone.co.uk%2Fmobile-phone-\ndeals%2Fhuawei-p20)\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=6506&clickref=TR-\nHuaweiP20&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metrofone.co.uk%2Fmobile-phone-\ndeals%2Fhuawei-p20)\n\n###\n\n[ Huawei P20 – 8GB, £26/month (after cashback) with no upfront cost on EE\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=6506&clickref=TR-\nHuaweiP20&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metrofone.co.uk%2Fmobile-phone-\ndeals%2Fhuawei-p20)\n\nLoads of data and nothing to pay upfront make this a great choice.

Its glass and metal body is also equipped\nwith IP53 certification, so while it isn’t technically as hardy against dust\nand water ingress as the [Samsung Galaxy\nS9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9) or its bigger\nsibling, the P20 Pro, it can withstand the elements to a point.\n\n**Related:[OnePlus 6T\nReview](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/oneplus-6t)**\n\n[ Next  \nScreen and Software\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/huawei-p20-screen-and-software)\n\n"}
