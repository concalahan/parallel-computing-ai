In its place was\nFace ID. If the rumours are to be believed then the upcoming [iPhone\nXS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-xs-2018-3551351) and [iPhone\n9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-9-release-date-3297160) (neither\nof which have been officially announced yet) will also use Face ID.\n\n## **What is Face ID and how does it work?**\n\nDue to the virtually edge-to-edge display on the [iPhone\nX](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-x-release-date-specs-features-\nuk-price-2951157), there isn’t enough room on the front of the phone for the\nhome button that has so far sat below the display on every previous iPhone.\n\nInstead, there’s a TrueDepth front-facing camera and infrared sensor that can\nscan your face. This isn’t entirely new for smartphones, the [Samsung Galaxy\nS9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s8) has a similar\nfeature and even an iris scanner, but it’s the first time Apple has utilised\nsomething like this.\n\n**Related:[iPad Pro 2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ipad-\npro-2018-release-date-specs-price-3482812)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSetting up Face ID is very similar to the Touch ID setup process. Just head\ninto Settings and then security, or you’ll be prompted to do this when you\nboot the phone for the first time.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThe camera and infrared sensor will scan your face as you move around. It\nworks with glasses, and even if you have hats and scarves on. It also works\nwell in the dark, something other face unlock solutions struggle with.\n\nYou will of course have to setup a pin-code too and this is used if for some\nreason your face isn’t recognised.\n\nLike Touch ID, Face ID isn’t just for unlocking your phone. It can also be\nused to authenticate purchases from iTunes and apps that previously used\nfingerprint unlock.\n\n## **Is Face ID secure?**\n\nApple says it is. It says your face data is stored in the protected enclave\ninside the [A11 Bionic\nchip](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-a11-processor-specs-\nperformance-benchmarks-3286346), and not sent anywhere else. It’s also not\npossible, in our tests anyway, to fool the system with a photo.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## **Which phones have Face ID?**\n\nFace ID is a headline feature on the iPhone X, however it’s rumoured that the\nupcoming iPhones for 2018 will rely on Face ID as the main method of unlocking\nand authentication.\n\n## Touch ID vs Face ID: Is Touch ID dead?\n\nThe answer to this is currently no. At the time of writing Touch ID still\nresides on a number of iPhones Apple sells and of course on other products\nlike the iPad Pro and MacBook Pro.\n\nHowever, it is rumoured that the new iPhones will eschew fingerprint sensors\ncompletely and only have Face ID.\n\n**Do you prefer Face ID or Touch ID?
