The answer to Nvidia’s top-spec 10-series graphics\ncard has been a long time coming and, now it’s here, it’s time to unpack\nexactly what AMD has brought to the table. Here’s everything you need to know\nincluding Vega’s price, specification and performance.**\n\n**Key info:**\n\n  * RX Vega 64 and 56 announced\n  * Launch date: August 14\n  * Prices range from $399 to $599\n  * Performance akin to GTX 1080\n\nThe Vega series is the most powerful AMD GPU launch in two years, when the\nfirm unveiled the R9 Fury and Fury X. This time around, the two GPUs are\ncalled RX Vega 64 and RX Vega 56. There will be three AMD-built versions of\nthe RX Vega 64: One liquid-cooled variation, one premium air-cooled version\nwith a fancy-looking shroud design, and then a more run-of-the-mill black\nplastic model. The RX Vega 56, meanwhile, just comes in black plastic.\n\nOf course, third-party models will be available as time goes on, and as those\narrive we’ll add them to this article.\n\n**Related:[Best graphics card](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\ngraphics-card)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n##  AMD RX Vega series specifications\n\nHere are the full key specifications for the liquid and air 64s, along with\nthe new 56 and previous-gen R9 Fury X.\n\n| Vega 64 Liquid | Vega 64 | Vega 56 | Fury X  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nCompute Units | 64 | 64 | 56 | 64  \nStream Processors | 4096 | 4096 | 3584 | 4096  \nBase frequency (MHz) | 1406 | 1247 | 1156 |  \nBoost frequency (MHz) | 1677 | 1677 | 1471 | 1050  \nMemory | 8GB HBM2 | 8GB HBM2 | 8GB HBM2 | 4GB HBM  \nMemory bus | 2048-bit | 2048-bit | 2048-bit | 4096-bit  \nMemory bandwidth | 483.8GB/s | 483.8GB/s | 410GB/s | 512GB/s  \nTFLOPS | 13.7 | 12.7 | 10.5 | 8.6  \nTDP (W) | 345 | 295 | 210 | 275  \nPrice | $699 (with other offers) | $499 | $399 | $549 (at launch)  \n  \nThe new GPUs use the latest high-bandwidth memory 2.0 (HBM2), which operate at\nfairly low memory clock speeds but have enormous 2048-bit memory busses that\nallow for an incredibly high flow of data to the GPU. Clock speeds are\nimpressively high; where the Fury X previously topped out at 1050MHz, the\nmodels on offer here manage up to 1677MHz. That’ll lead to some handy\nperformance gains.Both 64 and 56 cards are based on Vega 10, the codename for\nAMD’s latest graphics architecture. The 56-core version is a cut-down version\nof the 64-core model with lower clock speeds, similar to the relationship\nbetween Nvidia’s GTX 1080 and 1070.\n\nThese are power-hungry cards. With a 295W TDP (thermal design power), the Vega\n64 air-cooled model will consume more than 100W more power than the\ncompetition, namely the [GTX\n1070](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-gtx-1070). Even\nthe 56 consumes 35W more. A liquid-cooled option might just be a sensible\nchoice.\n\nHandily, AMD has created a [playlist of\nvideos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLx15eYqzJiffljSYrdF40mlek8wUBoISY)\nto take potential buyers through Vega’s technical back-end. Take a look if you\nwant to know more about Rapid Packed Math, FreeSync and HBM2.\n\n## AMD RX Vega performance: “Butter-smooth” 4K gaming?\n\nAMD is pushing the RX Vega line as the best entry into the world of 4K gaming.\nIt’s doing this by highlighting Vega’s chops as a card that can handle games\nrunning in the DirectX 12 and Vulkan graphics APIs, something it also did with\nits last major launch, the 400-series.\n\nHere are a couple of graphs featured on the AMD website and launch video to\nshow the performance increase over the Fury X generation.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIt’s always hard to compare GPU benchmarking across different companies,\nbecause we don’t know how they were tested. However, particularly the second\ngraph, suggests that in most games the RX Vega 64 will go toe-to-toe with\n[Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080](http://trustedreviews.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-\ngtx-1080) graphics card, which is currently on sale for around £500. Don’t\nexpect the performance difference in every game to be quite so large, though,\nespecially given Doom is certainly one of the better-optimised games for AMD\nkit.\n\nThe air-cooled Vega 64 is priced at $499, which will probably translate to\naround £450-500 in the UK. Meanwhile, the Vega 56 will rock up at $399,\nprobably around £350-400.\n\nDepending on which card you buy, you’ll also unlock discounts on other AMD\nproducts including Ryzen processors, motherboards and FreeSync monitors if you\npay a little more for one of AMD’s ‘Packs’.\n\n“Radeon Packs include a $200 discount on the 34” Samsung CF791 curved\nultrawide FreeSync monitor, and a $100 discount on select Ryzen™ 7 1800X\nprocessor and 370X motherboard combos — $300 in combined hardware savings. To\npower the new setup, there are three options for Radeon RX Vega:\n\n  * _Radeon Red Pack_ – Featuring the Radeon RX Vega  56, an air-cooled card priced at $499 SEP.\n  * _Radeon Black Pack_ – Featuring the Radeon RX Vega  64, an air-cooled card priced at $599 SEP.\n  * _Radeon Aqua Pack_ – Featuring the Radeon RX Vega  64 Liquid Cooled Edition, the most powerful of the Radeon RX Vega graphics cards, priced at $699 SEP.”\n\nYou’ll also pick up free copies of [Wolfenstein II: The New\nColossus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/wolfenstein-2-the-new-colossus-\npreview-release-date-preview-gameplay-trailers-2951732) and\n[Prey](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/prey).\n\nFans of AMD might be a little underwhelmed by this news, given that we’ve had\nthis sort of performance for over a year with Nvidia’s top-spec cards. Still,\npricing is competitive.\n\nIt’s little surprise, then, that in the launch video above that AMD is touting\nits other technologies as the main reason to pick up an RX Vega card. Indeed,\nit’s FreeSync that AMD is really pushing, which is a sensible move. It’s one\nof the company’s most obvious strengths; with monitors that support FreeSync\nsubstantially cheaper than the Nvidia G-Sync equivalents.\n\nThe whole bunch will go on sale August 14.\n\n_This is a developing story. We’ll update this piece with more new and\nanalysis as we get it._\n\n"}
