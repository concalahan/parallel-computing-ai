This means that there are very real reasons\nwhy you might want the smaller iPad Pro more than its big brother, aside from\nthe size and price differences.\n\n**Video: Which iPad Pro should you buy?**\n\nWhile the 9.7-inch iPad Pro has a smaller and lower resolution screen it\nretains the same pixels per inch (PPI) of the 12.9-inch variant and that means\nit looks just as sharp. Screens aren’t just about resolution and the small Pro\nhas a fantastic LCD panel, probably the best we’ve ever seen on a tablet. For\na start it has a huge colour gamut – that’s the range of colours it can\ndisplay. This means it can display a more varied range of colours than the\nbigger screen can, and it can do it more accurately too. That’s great if\nyou’re a designer.\n\nThe newer iPad Pro also comes with a great trick called True Tone. This adapts\nthe colour-tone of the screen based on the ambient light around you. It makes\nreading in bed or lower light a lot more comfortable. If you’re a designer and\nwant perfect colours you can turn this off.\n\nThe cameras are also much better on the smaller Pro. In fact it has the same\nfront and rear facing cameras as the iPhone 6S. That makes it the best tablet\nto take photos on bar none. By comparison the 12.9-inch model is years behind.\n\nFinally there’s the size to consider. I found the smaller iPad Pro a great\ndeal easier to transport and to use when out and about, particularly on a\nplane where the large iPad Pro just wouldn’t fit comfortably on the folding\ntable.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nIf it sounds like I’m recommending the 9.7-inch iPad Pro over the big one\nyou’d be right, in most cases it’s better and it’s almost £200/$300 cheaper,\nbut there are a few exceptions.\n\nThe larger screen means a larger keyboard and the 12.9-inch version is a lot\neasier to type on. It’s also a bigger canvas if you’re using it as a graphics\ntablet with the [Apple Pencil](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/apple-\npencil-vs-wacom-vs-surface-pen-vs-s-pen).\n\nThere’s also a little more grunt behind the big iPad Pro. It comes with 4GB\ninstead of 2GB of RAM. In day to day use this doesn’t seem to make much\ndifference, but if you like to work with large AUTOCAD files or do lots of\nvideo editing on the go this could save you time.\n\nTo read about the smaller iPad Pro [click\nhere](https://www.trustedreviews.com/9-7-inch-ipad-pro-review) or read on for\nthe 12.9-inch model.\n\n## What is the iPad Pro?\n\nThe iPad has been more successful than Apple could have hoped for.\n\nSure, the company was aware that its handsome slab of glass was going to be\nthe perfect platform on which to bring folk closer to content – be that web\nbrowsing, watching videos or casual gaming. What it may not have foreseen,\nthough, is the slew of third-party peripherals and apps that have been\ndesigned to extend its functionality beyond solely a “play thing” into a\nworkhorse too.\n\nEnter the iPad Pro, the daddy of all iPads thanks to an enormous 12.9-inch\nscreen. More than two inches bigger than the iPad Air 2 – and five more than\nthe iPad mini 4 – the iPad Pro provides around 80% more viewing area when\ncompared to its 9.7-inch counterpart.\n\nThe iPad Pro is bigger than all iPads that have gone before it – although\nincredibly, this increase in size is delivered in a package that’s only 33g\nheavier than the first version released back in 2010.\n\nEvery other feature of note receives a boost too. The screen has a higher\nresolution, there’s a brand-new A9X processor and 4GB of RAM. Apple claims the\niPad Pro is faster than 80% of portable PCs shipped last year, and while I’d\ntake that declaration with a pinch of salt, it may not be too far off the\nmark. The reason being that the vast majority of laptops sold tend to be cheap\nand cheerful – particularly with the advent of the Chromebook.  \n![iPad Pro pictures\n3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)  \nThe real question is, does it have what it takes to be the laptop replacement\nthat closest rival, the Microsoft Surface Pro 4, is aiming to deliver? Would\nyou rather have a iPad Pro in your bag than a\n[MacBook](https://www.trustedreviews.com/12-inch-macbook-2015-review) or [Dell\nXPS 13](https://www.trustedreviews.com/dell-xps-13-2015-review)?\n\nFor some, the answer is yes. The iPad Pro is a stylish, powerful tablet that,\nwhen combined with a keyboard and Apple Pencil, has the ability to stand toe-\nto-toe with traditional laptops – despite running a mobile operating system in\n[iOS 9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/ios-9-review).\n\nThose accessories are key, though. Without them, the iPad Pro is just an\noversized tablet – great for entertainment and consuming web content, but not\nmuch else. Unfortunately, as with most things Apple, neither come cheap. The\nkeyboard costs £139/$169, while the less essential Pencil will set you back a\nhefty £79/$99. Add this to the £679/$799 cost of the basic 32GB Wi-Fi-only\nmodel, and you’re looking at a considerable dent in your wallet.\n\n**Watch our iPad Pro vs Surface Pro 4 comparison video:  \n**\n\n## iPad Pro – Design\n\nHolding the iPad Pro makes you feel like a little kid, especially if you\nnormally use an iPad mini. There’s just so much of it.\n\nIn all other respects, the iPad Pro is identical to the smaller tablets in the\nrange. You get the excellent Touch ID fingerprint scanner built into the home\nbutton, a power button and volume controls.\n\nAside from the Lightning port for charging and connecting to a computer, and a\nfront and rear-facing camera, that’s about it. Like all of Apple’s tablets,\nthe iPad Pro is a simple proposition regardless of its “professional” moniker.\n\nLike all other tablets in its range, the iPad Pro is also super-model thin,\njust 6.9mm to be precise.\n\nSo even though it’s light and slim, its sheer size means you won’t be\ncomfortable using the iPad Pro with only one hand. In fact, it’s a handful\neven when using two.  \n![iPad Pro pictures\n4](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)  \nThis is where the Smart Keyboard becomes handy. It connects via three small\nmagnetic points on the left side of the device, which allow for both data and\npower to transfer. As a result, it doesn’t require a Bluetooth connection or\ncharging.\n\n## iPad Pro Smart Keyboard Cover\n\nThin keyboards for tablets have come on leaps and bounds, with the Microsoft\nSurface keyboard being among the best. The iPad Pro’s unit is almost as good –\nexcept that it doesn’t include a touchpad; you need to use the screen. A lot.  \n![iPad Pro pictures\n9](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)  \nCovered in a tough fabric, which makes it robust and water-resistant, it also\nserves as a screen cover for the iPad Pro.\n\nIt comes with a full Qwerty keyboard, with low-profile keys that help retain\nthe iPad Pro’s overall slenderness. There’s still adequate travel for you to\nknow that you’ve hit a key, and they’re large enough and spread enough to make\naccurate typing a doddle.\n\nUnlike the latest Microsoft Surface tablets, which feature adjustable\nkickstands, the iPad Pro has only one screen angle. It’s good for typing, but\nis a little too laid back for my liking when placed on a bedside table. I\nfound myself having to use a small book to prop up the rear and bring the\nscreen a little further forward for some late-night Netflix binging.  \n![iPad Pro pictures\n7](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)  \nWhere the iPad Pro trumps the Surface is with stability. It provides a solid\nfoundation whether used on a table or, crucially, on your lap. In fact, I\nfound that typing with the iPad Pro on my lap was more comfortable than using\nmy laptop, primarily because my thighs didn’t get singed by the hot\ncomponents, nor did the fans get blocked by my jeans.\n\nKeyboard shortcuts work too, but only for apps that support them. All of\nApple’s native apps – Pages, Notes, Numbers and Keynote – are good to go;\nGoogle Docs isn’t. Shortcuts do appear at the bottom of the screen close to\nyour fingers, which helps, but this isn’t ideal. App developers will catch up,\nbut at the moment shortcuts aren’t quite the benefit they could be.\n\nIt’s the same story with video apps. I found myself regularly whacking the\nspacebar to pause videos on YouTube only to realise that I wasn’t using a\nWindows 10 laptop. Touch the screen it is, then.\n\nApple’s keyboard isn’t the only version out there for the iPad Pro.  \n![iPad Pro pictures\n14](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \nLogitech, too, has released the backlit CREATE keyboard that covers the iPad\nPro entirely. Slightly cheaper and a lot chunkier than the Smart Keyboard, it\nmakes the iPad Pro look and feel far more like a full-sized laptop, especially\nsince the keys have more travel.\n\nIt also comes with handy shortcuts for switching apps, adjusting volume and\nbrightness, and positions the iPad Pro a little straighter. It’s the keyboard\nI’d choose to pair with the Apple’s giant tablet.\n\nThe iPad Pro comes close to emulating the form and function of a laptop, but\nit isn’t quite a replacement. If, like me, you spend much of your day typing\nthen you’ll miss a trackpad and screen pointer for editing.\n\n[ Next  \nScreen and Pencil ](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/ipad-pro-screen-\nand-pencil-page-2)\n\n"}
