The Japanese gaming giant announced\nits hybrid home/handheld device has just surpassed another of its classic\nconsoles.**\n\nThe 3.19 million Switch consoles sold worldwide during the last quarter brings\nthe Switch to over 22.86 million overall. That’s more than the Nintendo\nGameCube managed in its lifetime.\n\nThe GameCube enjoyed a fruitful six-year run on the shelves, from 2001-2007,\nduring which it shipped 21.74m units. The Switch does have a ways to go become\ncatching the Gamecube’s software tally though, with 208.57m compared to\n111.10m thus far (via [Geekwire](https://www.geekwire.com/2018/nintendo-\nswitch-tops-3m-units-latest-quarter-surpasses-gamecube-lifetime-console-\nsales/)).\n\nThe Switch’s momentum looks set to continue with the forthcoming launch of\nSuper Smash Bros. Ultimate and Pokemon Let’s Go! Pikachu/ Let’s Go! Eevee\nprior to the Christmas season. The company will also receive a massive boost\nin hardware and software sales during the Black Friday week sales; although\nthere are likely to be limited discounts available on the consoles themselves.\n\n**Related:[Best Nintendo Switch games\n2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-nintendo-switch-\ngames-3435122)**\n\nThe Switch surpassed the Nintendo Wii U after around one year on sale and is\nrapidly approaching doubling the 13 million the ill-fated console shipped\nduring his run. Beyond that, the Nintendo 64 is still ahead of the Switch,\nwith 32.93 lifetime sales and 224.97 million games sold.\n\nThe all-time leader is naturally the original Wii console, which leads the way\nwith 101.63 million consoles and 920.38 million games over the course its\nlifetime. Nintendo would probably consider the Switch a success if it gets\nhalf way towards these numbers, which will likely never be topped.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n**Are you planning on a Nintendo Switch purchase during this forthcoming\nholiday season?
