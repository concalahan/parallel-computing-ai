Spotify's new playlist service explained | Trusted Reviews", "description": "![Spotify and\nAccuweather](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Spotify’s quest to curate the perfect playlist has taken a slightly\nunexpected turn, after it teamed up with Accuweather to create a new service\nthat lets the weather control what you listen to.**\n\nWorking alongside the weather forecast whizz kids at Accuweather, Spotify has\ndeveloped a site called Climatune that provides playlists based on the weather\nof the location that you are currently situated in.\n\n“There is a clear connection between what’s in the skies and what’s on users’\nplay queues,” said Spotify data researcher, Ian Anderson, in a post on the\ncompany’s [blog](https://news.spotify.com/uk/2017/02/07/having-music-mood-\nswings-blame-it-on-the-rain-spotify-and-accuweather-reveal-how-weather-\naffects-music-listening/). “For almost all of the major cities around the\nworld that we studied, sunny days translate to higher streams of happier-\nsounding music.”\n\nWhen you visit the Climatune site, it immediately uses your device’s location\nto provide a playlist based on the real-time weather, which you can choose to\nplay either inside your browser or via the Spotify app itself.\n\nIf you don’t like what it spits out, then there is the option to change the\nweather to one of six options and Climatune will provide a playlist based on\nthat forecast instead.\n\nSpotify and Accuweather analysed a year’s worth of weather data and correlated\nit with some 85 billion streams to create the site. They found that sunny days\nbred happier listeners, rainy days brought with them ‘lower-energy, sadder-\nsounding music’ and snowy days were the time for instrumentals.\n\nThe data was broken down by country and showed that, although the UK followed\nthe trend for sadder music in the rain, it bucked the global trend for being\nhappy in the sun by showing a particular penchant for dancing under cloud\ncover. Given that the UK averages just 1,493 hours of sun per year, we’d all\nbe very bloody grumpy listeners if we were only happy when the sun is out.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nYou can check out Climatune for yourself\n[here.](https://weather.withspotify.com/)\n\n**WATCH:[Best headphones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-\nheadphones_round-up)**\n\n****\n\nWhich music streaming service do you use?
