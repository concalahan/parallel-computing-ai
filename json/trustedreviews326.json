That’s in general and not just for Ford because\nthere are a lot of hard situations out there on the road.\n\n“We do a lot of testing for traffic jams, we have been in London, Paris, and\nMadrid driving in traffic jams. Every country is different, every city is\ndifferent – people drive different,” explained Meyer.\n\n“I would say fully autonomous driving where you can sit in your vehicle,\nprogramme it on your navigation system and it will drive you there, that will\ndefinitely be a long way away,” the engineer added.\n\n**Related:[Apple Car News](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-car-news-\nrumours-driverless-price-release-date-electric)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nWith Google aiming to get a fully-autonomous vehicle on the road by 2020, and\nApple almost certainly working on their own self-driving car, the race is on\nto get the vehicles ready as soon as possible.\n\nAndreas, speaking about Google’s project, continued: “I think 2020 is\nunrealistic at least not on every road. Maybe in their environment in their\ncity, but not on every road.”\n\n“We are also working on something like that. We have the strategy that we go\nthere step by step, increase the scope of the features,” Meyer told us.\n“Further features could contribute to autonomy like lane changing but\ncertainly only on highways, not city driving so we go there step by step. City\ndriving is a long way off.”\n\n“We can get a lot of experience with these features now. Basically we have to\nadd a lot more sensors all around the car sensing the environment. That will\nbe the hard part for autonomy,” he explained.\n\n![FordAachenResearch](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)_Cars with the latest in camera tech are tested\noutside Ford’s Research and Innovation Centre in Aachen, Germany_\n\n**Related:[Apple CarPlay vs Android\nAuto](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/apple-carplay-vs-android-auto)**\n\nAndreas’ scepticism is mirrored by MD of the Research and Innovation centre,\nPim van der Jagt, who said that the many issues facing makers of fully\nautonomous vehicles could mean that self-driving cars [won’t be ready for\nproduction any time soon](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ford-it-s-\nalmost-impossible-to-sell-self-driving-cars).\n\nFord recently opened a research centre in Silicon Valley, similar to the one\nwhich Mr van der Jagt heads in Aachen.\n\nSpeaking about the culture of Silicon Valley, Mr van der Jagt said: “We’re\njust trying to stop [companies like Apple and Google] from hiring our people.\nSilicon Valley from a people standpoint is very difficult. These companies\nthere just keep hiring people and the average person that goes there, these\nyoung smart kids, usually work for a company for 10 years and if they’re not\n100% happy they look for another company.”\n\n“The mentality there is that they try to switch companies every two years and\nincrease their salary or go to a startup and then go to the stock market and\ncash 30 million,” said the Ford exec. “We want to be there to have access to\nthese startups and the kind of mentality there. But from a personnel\nstandpoint it’s very difficult to keep your people and stop losing your good\npeople to other companies.”\n\n![PimvanderJagtFord](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)_MD of the Aachen Research and Innovation centre,\nPim van der Jagt, explains Ford’s plans for the future_\n\n[Ford CEO Mark Field](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ford-ceo-self-\ndriving-cars-coming-within-four-years) surprised many last month when he said\nthat Ford could have an autonomous vehicle on the road within the next four\nyears.\n\nThe company has become the first to test autonomous vehicles in a simulated\ncity, known as Mcity, near Ford’s headquarters in Detroit, Michigan.\n\nBut with technical challenges such as those faced by Ford’s own engineers in\nthe way, it seems this could very well be wishful thinking.\n\n"}
