We\ncast an early eye over the Swift 7, Swift 5 and Swift 3 upgrades.**\n\nAll three new Acer Swift 2018 laptops are ultra-portables and should find\nthemselves positioned as some of the lightest laptops in the world when they\nlaunch this autumn. These are aimed at those don’t fancy lugging about a back-\nbreaking rucksack around, but still need something that can handle the basics\nwith aplomb.\n\n_Check out our full range guide below to find out which is best for you._\n\n**Related:[Best laptops](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nlaptops-3431966)**\n\n## **Acer Swift 7 2018: Specs, release date and price**\n\nCalled the “thinnest laptop in the world” by Acer at IFA, the new Swift 7 2018\nwill steal the mantle from the previous iteration of the [Acer Swift\n7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/acer-swift-7), which wasn’t released\nall that long ago.\n\nAt just 10mm thin and weighing 1kg, the Swift 7 is as ultra-portable as they\ncome and looks ideal for on-the-go working and long-distance travel.\n\nIts bezels have been squashed down to a bare minimum, with the machine\nboasting a 92% screen-to-body ratio. There’s no word on the device’s exact\nscreen size just yet, with Acer tight-lipped on its specs, but something\nsimilar to the existing Swift 7’s 14-inch Full HD IPS display seems logical.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nIn fact, the only specification that Acer has revealed so far is that the\nSwift 7 2018 will be toting an 8th-generation Intel Core i7 processor.\n\nThe price and release date are also yet to be announced, but we’ll be sure to\nupdate you once we receive further information.\n\n**Related:[Best student laptops](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nlaptops-for-students)**\n\n##  **Acer Swift 5** **2018: Specs, release date and price**  \n\n![Acer Swift\n2018](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAcer seems to love breaking records, and so following the Swift 7’s lead, the\ncompany revealed that the [Swift 5\n2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/acer-swift-5-2018-3548218) will\nlikely become the world’s lightest 15-inch notebook when its wafer-thin bezels\nstart hitting shelves later this year.\n\nWeighing only 990g and measuring up at 14.9mm thin, it should be dead easy to\nfit this in almost any laptop bag, with the aforementioned 15-inch screen set\nto offer a Full HD resolution (1920 x 1080 pixels).\n\nDespite its featherlight form, the Swift 5 still packs some power with the\n8th-generation Intel Core i7-8565U and i5-8265U processors, and can reportedly\nkeep chugging on for eight hours.\n\nThe 15-inch model of the Swift 5 will be available to buy in Europe this\nNovember at a base price of €1099, and in America on January 2019 from $1099.\nThe 14-inch model, meanwhile, will be made available sooner – the European\nlaunch is pegged for this September with a starting price of €999.\n\n## Acer Swift 3 **2018: Specs, release date and price**  \n\n![Acer Swift\n2018](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAlso joining the new Acer Swift 2018 range is the [Swift\n3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/acer-swift-3-2018) laptop, with the\nnew model boasting – you guessed it! – even slimmer bezels than before.\n\nBoth 13.3-inch and 14-inch models will be available, and you’ll have the\noption to grab the Swift 3 come with integrated 4G LTE connectivity, so you\ncarry on browsing the web when you’ve left the comfort of your Wi-Fi-connected\nhome. That should make it an ideal Netflix companion, with the 1920 x 1080\npixel display sounding perfectly serviceable on paper.\n\nBear in mind, though, that using 4G will deplete the Swift 3’s battery rather\nquickly, so you’ll want to have it hooked up to Wi-Fi to reach Acer’s claimed\n13-hour battery life. The 8th-gen Intel Core processors and 8GB RAM should\nensure the Swift 3 ticks along smoothly, too.\n\nThe Swift 3’s hardly a powerhouse, but the option of a NVIDIA MX150 graphics\ncard at least gives you the option of casual gaming.\n\nBoth models of the Swift 3 will be launching in Europe this year, with the\n13-inch version arriving in October for €799, and the 14-inch variant hitting\nstores in November for the same price.\n\nLike the other Acer laptops here, there’s still no word on a UK price, but\nwe’ll update this guide one we have more information.\n\n**Excited about the new Acer Swift 2018 range?
