Samsung\nhas announced a bunch of new TVs. Here, we run through everything you need to\nknow before you buy one.**\n\nWhat follows is Samsung’s TV lineup for 2018. It isn’t the complete range,\nsince Samsung is only confirming its QLED models for now. I’ll be updating\nthis page with news about the more affordable models as soon as it becomes\navailable.\n\nUsually, I’d just run through the list of TVs and explain the differences\nbetween models. This year is different, since Samsung hasn’t only shared its\n2018 plans with Trusted Reviews; the company has revealed its battle plan for\nthe next few years, specifically regarding how it aims to fight the growing\nOLED market.\n\nI’ll start with the freshly announced Samsung QLED information, then follow it\nup with an explainer of Micro Full Array and Micro LED tech below. Here is\nSamsung’s crazy three-point plan to beat OLED in 2018.\n\n## **Samsung QLED 2018 models announced**\n\nIn 2017, Samsung went big with QLED – the latest iteration of its Quantum Dot-\ntoting LED LCD TVs. The plan involved building strongholds in the land of\n1000+ nits brightness and colour volume: the lofty heights that LCD TVs can\nreach, but where darkness-loving OLED can’t follow.\n\nThings didn’t go to plan, however. While Samsung did manage _groundbreaking_\nlevels of luminance and saturation, it stuck with edge-lit LCD designs – and\nran into that technology’s limitations. Essentially, when you push brightness\nas high as 2000 nits, edge lighting and zonal dimming simply aren’t enough to\nstem the tide of lighting artefacts.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThe above issues were compounded with large price tags, plus OLED’s creeping\ngains in highlight and mid-tone performance. The final score for 2017: OLED 1,\nSamsung QLED 0.\n\nSamsung has learned from its mistakes, however. The company is continuing with\nQLED in 2018 – but, crucially, you can expect lower prices and better black\nperformance.\n\n### Get a free Xbox One X when you buy any Samsung QLED TV and Soundbar\n\n[](http://clkuk.tradedoubler.com/click?p\\(267868\\)a\\(2961399\\)g\\(22954764\\)url\\(https://www.appliancesdirect.co.uk/bd/samsung-\nbundle-offer\\))\n\n[](http://clkuk.tradedoubler.com/click?p\\(267868\\)a\\(2961399\\)g\\(22954764\\)url\\(https://www.appliancesdirect.co.uk/bd/samsung-\nbundle-offer\\))\n\n###\n\n[Enjoy the ultimate 4K gaming experience\n\n](http://clkuk.tradedoubler.com/click?p\\(267868\\)a\\(2961399\\)g\\(22954764\\)url\\(https://www.appliancesdirect.co.uk/bd/samsung-\nbundle-offer\\))\n\nWith the combination of 4K TV, Soundbar and a free Xbox One X this deal is a\ngamers dream.

Firstly, Samsung is sticking to its ‘Q’ labelling\nsystem, but adding an ‘N’ to separate the 2018 range from the 2017 range.\n\nLast year, the Samsung QLED models were limited to the 9, 8 and 7 Series TVs.\nThis year, there will be a 6 Series QLED. This means that models down the\nrange will benefit from the lovely colours. There are also more screen size\noptions, which is great for folk who are tight on space and also those with\nmore sizeable homes. Most importantly, the picture has been significantly\nupgraded.\n\n![Samsung QLED\n2018](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Samsung Q9FN – 55, 65, 75 and 88 inches**\n\n  * Samsung QE55Q9FN\n  * Samsung QE65Q9FN\n  * Samsung QE75Q9FN\n  * Samsung QE88Q9FN\n\nThe single most important thing about the 2018 Samsung QLED range is that it\nis bringing back backlighting, not just relying on edge lighting. That’s\nimportant since this Q9 also offers a peak brightness of 2000 nits. The Q9FN\nwill offer full-array local dimming (FALD) with hundreds of dimming zones.\n\nThis represents a huge upgrade in lighting management, but Samsung has learned\nnot to rely on that alone and has several backup measures. In a bid to ramp up\nblack performance, the company is employing layers of black and anti-\nreflection filter, designed to minimise internal light leakage and external\nglare. The panel also includes a layer with a prism-like structure, which aims\nto improve viewing angles and stop the picture washing out when viewed from\nthe side.\n\nIn addition, Samsung is using software to help. The TV will run an anti-\nblooming algorithm, which identifies bright areas and dims their boundaries to\navoid halo effects.\n\n**Review:[Samsung Q9FN](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-\nqled-q9fn)**\n\n[![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/sony-bravia-\ntvs-2951944)\n\nIt works. The combined efforts of these black-improving measures are hugely\neffective. I viewed the new panel next to a 2017 LG OLED, and alongside the\nSony ZD9 from 2016 (widely regarded as the best FALD still being sold). The\nSamsung panel demonstrated noticeably better lighting localisation than the\nSony, with less blooming.\n\nAgainst the OLED? I struggled to notice a difference from a ‘normal’ position,\nsat down a few metres away. It was only when I walked closer to the TV that I\nsaw some very slight blooming on the LCD. Due to the structure of LED LCD TVs,\nit’s unlikely that they’ll ever match the look of emissive tech such as OLED.\nBut that doesn’t mean the improvements aren’t significant.\n\nConclusion: the company’s LED LCD tech is now a lot closer to OLED’s black\nlevels. If the company’s pricing strategy is sensible, the 2018 Samsung QLED\nrange could be a solid retort to OLED. Prices seem reasonable, too: the\nflagship Q9FN costs £3000 for the 55-inch model and £3799 for the 65-inch at\nlaunch. That’s firmly in OLED territory.\n\n**Related:[LG C8 vs Samsung\nQ9FN](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-c8-vs-samsung-q9fn-3530353)**\n\n![Samsung QLED\n2018](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThere’s more. Samsung is paying extra attention to the style element of TVs,\ntaking steps to ensure your TV blends better into your living room. First,\nthere’s a new ‘Invisible Connection’, or a single super-thin cable that will\nbe hard to spot unless you’ve got the eyes of a hawk. The idea is that your\nmains cable and nest of HDMI cables will go into the standard, separate\nconnections box, and then a single, barely there cable will take that to the\nTV. Samsung has done something similar before, but this is the first time such\na thin cable has handled both data and power duties.\n\nThe final upgrade will appeal to those who don’t want a big blank screen in\nthe living room. Samsung is bringing in the Ambient Mode from its Frame TVs,\nwhich essentially gives your TV a low-powered screensaver mode. You can have\nart on display, or the weather, or you can even display a picture of your\nwallpaper. It sounds power-hungry, but Samsung estimates that it will come to\n$0.59 or £0.68 a month, based on three hours’ use a day.\n\nOh, and note the introduction of the 55-inch option. This is the first time\nthere’s been a ‘small’ version of the flagship model, although unfortunately\nit’s only available in Europe at the moment.\n\n**Related:[Sony ZF9 vs Samsung Q9FN](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/sony-\nzf9-vs-samsung-q9fn-3527002)**\n\n**Samsung Q8CN – 55 and 65 inches**\n\n  * Samsung QE55Q8CN\n  * Samsung QE65Q8CN\n\nSamsung is the only major manufacturer still pushing curved screens. Not a lot\nof them, mind – the Q8CN is the only one in the QLED range.\n\nThe Q8CN retains most of the features of the Q9FN, with a few exceptions.\nFirstly, peak brightness drops to 1500 nits. Second, it loses the full-array\nlocal dimming – Q8CN, Q7FN and Q6FN will be bottom-edge lit. But they’ll\nbenefit from the Q9FN’s black filters and advanced dimming algorithms.\n\nThere’s also a flat Q8FN model with full array backlight. Initially that was\ngoing to be exclusive to the US, but after some pressure from customers and\ntech journalists, Samsung has agreed to bring it to the UK. Here it is called\nthe Q8DN.\n\n**Read our review:[Samsung\nQ8FN](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-q8dn)**\n\n![Samsung QLED\n2018](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Samsung Q7FN – 55, 65 and 75 inches**\n\n  * Samsung QE55Q7FN\n  * Samsung QE65Q7FN\n  * Samsung QE75Q7FN\n\nWant a flat QLED without paying top money? The Q7F of 2017 did the job nicely,\nand now we have the Q7FN. It has the same 1500-nit peak brightness as the\nQ8CN. There’s also a new 75-inch option, which wasn’t available last year.\n\nDespite being slightly lower in the range, the Q7FN packs the same number of\nconnections as its big siblings: four HDMI and three USB ports.\n\n![Samsung QLED\n2018](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Samsung Q6FN – 49, 55, 65, 75 and 82 inches**\n\n  * Samsung QE49Q6FN\n  * Samsung QE55Q6FN\n  * Samsung QE65Q6FN\n  * Samsung QE75Q6FN\n  * Samsung QE82Q6FN\n\nNow we get into a slightly confusing territory. Previously, the Samsung 6\nSeries were lower-end models, but now Samsung has brought the QLED range down.\nEssentially, you’ll be able to enjoy the colours and brightness of a QLED at a\nlower price.\n\nPeak brightness drops to 1000 nits, which is less than what’s offered on the\nother QLEDs, but it’s more than you’d get on a 6 Series model. We also lose\nthe Ultra Black technology seen in the senior models, but this shouldn’t be a\nconcern – the Q6FN is half as bright as the Q9FN, so its dimming tech doesn’t\nneed to be quite as powerful.\n\nFour HDMI ports remain (always a sign a manufacturer is taking things\nseriously) but USB ports drop down to two.\n\nOh, and the design is more basic – you don’t get the premium metal trimmings.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Samsung 8K QLED with AI upscaling**\n\n## Coming Soon: 8K Micro Full Array – the Samsung Q9SN\n\nIn the second half of 2018, we will see a new tech called ‘Micro Full Array’\n(MFA). There will only be one model, the 85-inch Samsung Q9SN (QE85Q9SN).\n\nMFA is basically FALD tech on steroids. We’re looking at brightness up to 4000\nnits, with black levels plunging to an OLED-matching 0.001 nits.\n\nAnd if the 2018 QLED having hundreds of dimming zones is a good thing (and it\nis) then how about over 10,000 zones? That promises a level of lighting\ncontrol never before seen on an LCD TV. I didn’t get to see one of these next\nto an OLED, so I can’t compare, but that number of dimmable zones has got to\nbe a good thing.\n\nThis tech doesn’t just have a massive number of zones; it is also physically\nmassive. It will only be available at 85 inches. That’s bound to be\nimpractical and insanely expensive, but I get the feeling Samsung is really\njust trying to make a statement with this.\n\n**Related:[OLED vs QLED](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/oled-vs-\nqled-3530313)**\n\nAs for resolution, this TV won’t be in 4K. Because it will have a native 8K\nresolution.\n\nEvery year at CES, I see TV makers bring along 8K displays to show off, but\nthat’s just a willy-waving proof of concept. Samsung, however, is actually\nbrave (or mad) enough to bring one to market. You will be able to buy one of\nthese in 2018.\n\nBut why? Bringing out an 8K screen seems an odd move when the blossoming 4K\nmarket has yet to become mainstream. And there’s virtually no content out\nthere – I only know of test footage from Japan, where broadcaster NHK has been\ntesting the waters of 8K.\n\nSamsung tells me it’s first and foremost a means of retaining sharpness and\nclarity, finer details and gradations. After all, if you bump a 4K resolution\nfrom 55 inches to 82 inches, the latter is going have a lower pixel density\nand look a little softer. Samsung’s approach is to feed in 4K video and\nupscale it to 8K. Samsung calls it ‘AI Upscaling’, a fancy term that doesn’t\nseem too far off what some TVs do to bring standard definition up to 1080p, or\nfrom HD to 4K.\n\n‘AI Upscalng’ will employ noise reduction to preserve details, edge\nrestoration to prevent jagged contours. It also compares incoming video with\nan image database to make calculations – not far off what Sony has been doing\nwith its highly effective X-Reality Pro upscaling.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSamsung’s The Wall – 146-inch modular Micro LED\n\n## The next stage: Micro LED\n\nSamsung isn’t done. They’re working to bring to market a new tech called Micro\nLED.\n\nThis is where Samsung finally drops LCD and adopts an emissive technology,\nsimilar to OLED and plasma before it. Samsung says it will be less power-\nhungry than OLED, with less potential for degradation over time. This is about\nas close to the ‘true’ QLED that folks on the internet have been speculating\nabout for years, before Samsung decided to use ‘QLED’ to brand its Quantum Dot\nLCD TVs.\n\nMicro LED stems from Samsung’s existing LED Cinema technology, which uses\nmodular LED panels pieced together to create a gigantic picture. The theory\nhere is the same: at CES 2018 Samsung is showing off a 146-inch modular\nversion that it calls ‘The Wall’. It’s not been announced how the modular\nsystem works, or what sizes will be available, but it’s safe to say Samsung is\nstarting big before working down to sensible (affordable) sizes.\n\nWhen? The estimates are anywhere from one to nine years…\n\n## Samsung’s future is bright. And crazy\n\nI’ve got to give it to Samsung. The 2017 QLED plan didn’t go as intended, but\nthe guys in Seoul clearly weren’t disheartened. It’s quite the opposite –\nthey’ve doubled down on their commitment to fight OLED on several fronts. Some\nof the plan is practical. Some of the plan is plain mad. But from what I’ve\nseen, all of it is hugely impressive.\n\nIt’s clear that to Samsung, the big ‘OLED vs QLED’ debate is only just\nbeginning.\n\n**Since you’re looking at TVs, check out our coverage of the other brands:**\n\n**[Sony TVs 2018: What you need to know before you buy Bravia  \n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/sony-bravia-tvs-2951944)**[**Panasonic’s\n2018 4K HDR and HD TV lineup explained  \n**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/panasonic-tvs-2018-4k-hdr-\noled-2952995)[**LG’s 2018 OLED TVs**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/new-\nlg-2018-oled-tv-models-specs-price-release-date-3367924)\n\n_What do you make of Samsung’s OLED-fighting plans?
