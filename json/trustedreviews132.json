The Note was the original device to really kickstart the phablet\ncraze. So what can the [Samsung Galaxy Note\n9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-9-release-\ndate-3304594) do to stand out?\n\nLike many phone releases these days, pretty much every detail of the Note 9\nhas been leaked in the weeks and months leading up to the event. We’ve had\nspec dumps, renders, even official-looking images and pre-order bonuses.\n\n**Related:[Samsung Galaxy Note 9 vs Galaxy\nS9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-9-vs-\ngalaxy-s9-3527010)**\n\nAll that aside, the Note 9 still looks like a great device. As we saw with the\njump from [Samsung Galaxy S8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-\ngalaxy-s8) to [Samsung Galaxy\nS9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9), the changes are\niterative and look to tweak the formula rather than rip it up and start again.\n\nIf you’re looking to upgrade from the Note 8 then there’s plenty to think\nabout. Let’s take a closer look at what’s new.\n\n**Related:[Best smartphone](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nsmartphone-3431175)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n## **Samsung Galaxy Note 9 vs Note 8 design –What’s changed?**\n\nThe Note 8 received a huge visual overhaul in the same way that the Galaxy S8\ndid. The bezel surrounding the display was slimmed right down, the fingerprint\nsensor was repositioned around the rear and the sloping display made far more\nprominent. The [Samsung Galaxy Note\n8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-8) was, and\nstill is, a gorgeous phone.\n\nSo it’s hardly surprising to discover that Samsung is sticking with, what is,\nmostly the same design for a second year. There are a couple of changes that\nshould make the device a better to use phone overall.\n\n**Related:[Samsung Galaxy Note 9 vs Galaxy S8\nPlus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-9-vs-\ngalaxy-s8-plus-3526323)**\n\nOne of the most obvious changes is the new position of the fingerprint sensor.\nInstead of sitting awkwardly next to the camera module, it now sits below.\nIt’s a simple change but one that fixes a big issue.\n\nWhile the Note 9 is a similar size to the Note 8, the screen is actually\nlarger: 6.4 inches as opposed to 6.3 inches. Reducing the size of the bezel\nallows for this.\n\n![Samsung Galaxy Note\n9](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nBoth phones are constructed from glass, with a metal rim sandwiched in-\nbetween. USB-C ports sit along the bottom, with a headphone jack. Seeing as\nSamsung kept hold of the 3.5mm port for the Galaxy S9, we always expected it\nto be here too.\n\nThe real key feature of the entire Note series sits beside the USB-C port: the\nS Pen. For the Note 9, Samsung has upgraded the included stylus to feature\nBluetooth, as well as offering it in a range of colours.\n\nBluetooth seems an odd addition, and we’re not yet sold on exactly the\nfunctionality it will bring. Samsung says you’ll be able to control\npresentations from across the room and use it as a remote camera shutter –\nneither of which sound particularly interesting.\n\nWater-resistance remains, and the use of the glass body ensures the Note 9\nwill charge wirelessly.\n\n## **Samsung Galaxy Note 9 vs Note 8 specs and features – How much faster can\nit be?**\n\nInside the Samsung Galaxy Note 9, you’ll find plenty of upgrades over the\noutgoing model. The Exynos 8895 has been replaced with the 9810, giving faster\noverall performance, better graphics and improved connectivity. That Exynos\nversion won’t see a release in the US, however. Instead, the US version of the\nNote 9 will pack a [Snapdragon\n845](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/snapdragon-845-benchmark-phones-\nspeed-3390981). Again, this is an upgrade over the Snapdragon 835 used in the\nNote 8.\n\n| **Note 8** | **Note 9**  \n---|---|---  \n**Screen** |  6.3-inch, quad-HD AMOLED, HDR | 6.4-inch, quad-HD AMOLED, HDR  \n**Performance** |  Snapdragon 835/Exynos 8895 | Snapdragon 845/Exynos 9810  \n**RAM** |  6GB | 6GB/8GB  \n**Storage** |  64GB + microSD | 64GB/256GB + microSD  \n**Rear camera** |  2 x 12MP, f/1.7 (main), OIS, 4K video, Dual Pixel | 2 x\n12MP (f/1.7 – f/1.5 – f/2.4 – main), OIS, 4K video, Dual Pixel  \n**Front camera** |  8MP, f/1.7 | 8MP, f/1.7  \n**Battery** |  3300mAh, fast charge, wireless charging | 4000mAh, fast charge,\nwireless charging  \n**S-Pen** |  Yes | Yes (with Bluetooth)  \n  \nA big push for the Note 9 is gaming. This is the first Android phone on which\nyou’ll be able to play [Fortnite](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/android-\nfortnite-samsung-exclusive-3526371), so expect a fluid experience. Fortnite\nwill come to other phones in the Galaxy family after a month, with other\nAndroids joining the party later.\n\nRAM remains at 6GB (plump for the 512GB model and you’ll get 8GB RAM) – the\nideal amount, in our opinion – and storage options now go all the way up to\n512GB. There’s a microSD slot, too, so with the right card you have more than\na terabyte of storage with the Note 9.\n\nEven though the Note 9 has a larger screen than the Note 8, the resolution of\nthe AMOLED panel remains at 1440 x 2960. Both phones also support\n[HDR](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/what-is-hdr10-3294683); expect\nsupport for this from Netflix, YouTube and Prime Video.\n\n**Related:[Best Android phone](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nandroid-phones-3438996)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe upgrade that could make the Note 9 a much better phone is the 4000mAh\nbattery. The Note 8 struggled in terms of endurance, and during our original\nreview of the phone, it struggled to get beyond a day of usage. For a large\ndevice such as this, that just isn’t good enough. Including a bigger cell\ninside the Note 9 should offset such issues and, fingers-crossed, there won’t\nbe any Note 7 meltdowns this time around.\n\nIn terms of the camera, Samsung has pretty much taken all the good bits from\nthe excellent Galaxy S9 Plus and jammed them into the Note 9.\n\n**Related:[Samsung Galaxy Note 9 vs Galaxy S9\nPlus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-9-vs-\ngalaxy-s9-plus-3525284)**\n\nYou have the same dual-aperture lens, which will switch between f/1.5 and\nf/2.4 depending on the light. Also included is dual-pixel focusing tech and a\nsecondary sensor for 2x zoom. The biggest difference between the Note 8 and\nNote 9 is that clever shifting aperture, as the outgoing Note itself had a\nsecondary sensor for improved zooming.\n\nThere are a couple of camera features that remain the same. The front sensor\nis still an 8-megapixel f/1.7 unit, 4K video support up to 60fps remains, and\nOIS is present on both cameras.\n\nThe Note 8 already ticked pretty much every connectivity box, so there was\nlittle for Samsung to add aside from the faster LTE speed afforded by the\nimproved silicone inside. Both phones have NFC, Bluetooth 5, GPS and can be\nhooked up to a monitor via\n[Dex](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-dex).\n\n**Related:[Samsung Galaxy Note 9 vs iPhone\nX](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-9-vs-\niphone-x-3527113)**\n\n## **Samsung Galaxy Note 9 vs Note 8 price – How much does it cost?**\n\nRight, let’s get this out of the way quickly – neither of these phones is\ncheap. The Samsung Galaxy Note 8 retailed for £869/$899 when it was first\nreleased, although you can now pick one up for less than £600 on Amazon.\n\nThe Note 9 is pricier than the Note 8, starting at £899. If you want to have\nthat 512GB storage then be prepared to pay £1099.\n\n## Early Verdict\n\nThe Note 9 isn’t a huge step forward for the series. Instead, it tweaks and\nfine-tunes the formula to hopefully make a better device. The biggest upgrade\nis the battery, which could take things to another level.\n\n"}
