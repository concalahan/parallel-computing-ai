{"result": 0, "title": "OnePlus 6T review | Trusted Reviews", "description": "* ![OnePlus 6T 3/4 view]()The front camera takes nice shots overall and offers balanced beauty controlsbut colours seem a little off here.As for video, you can shoot up to 4K resolution at 60fps (limited to fiveminutes when using these settings) and the results aren’t half bad. It isn’tgoing to give the [iPhone XS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xs) cause for concern, partly because of the tinny audio but partly becausethe image stability could also be improved too. Beyond that footage ispleasing and the option of slow-motion recording at up to 480fps (at 720p) isa feature unique to OnePlus.## OnePlus 6T – Battery LifeThe OnePlus 6T’s 3700mAh power pack doesn’t quite top the 4000mAh behemothfound in the [Huawei P20Pro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/huawei-p20-pro) or the even morecapacious 4200mAh offering used by its new sibling, the [Mate 20Pro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/huawei-mate-20-pro), but it’sstill a winner based on my experiences. It’s clearly equipped to handle a dayand a half of frequent use and I imagine that for many it’ll stretch to twodays between charges without too much trouble.With 13 hours away from the wall plug and four hours of screen-on time, myOnePlus 6T finished the day at an even 50% charge. In that time I streamed 30minutes of Netflix, which sapped 6% of the charge (with the screen brightnessat half), while a 30 minute stretch of PUBG Mobile, running through multipleshort, sharp arcade matches, took 8% out of the battery.Fast Charge (formerly Dash Charge) is a big reason to buy a OnePlus. It’s beenthe best fast-charging standard out there for a while (although that’sstarting to change) and the company has distilled the premise with simpleelegance into the tagline, “a day’s power in half an hour”. With that claim inmind, I was somewhat skeptical this time around.Increasing the capacity of the battery without increasing the rate of chargemeans that even Fast Charge might not be quick enough to juice up the sizeablecell inside the 6T. I was wrong to fret. A 30-minute stint at the wall plugtook my OnePlus 6T from 39% to 86% charge (that’s 47%). Sure, it’s not thefull 50% that I get through in my general day-to-day but its close enough. Icould have switched off mobile data and Wi-Fi while it charged, turned onflight mode or switched the phone off altogether if I was desperate for alittle more juice in that same time frame but I didn’t need to.What I would say is that with the combination of OnePlus’ 20W charging techand a battery the size of the 6T’s – the company’s promise has reached itslimit. Going forward, if the brand still expects to tout a day’s use from 30minutes charge time, it’ll either have to drop the capacity of the battery inits next phone or release an improved, even more rapid version of Fast Charge.## Why buy the OnePlus 6T?While you could say that OnePlus has made some sacrifices in developing theOnePlus 6T, they all seem rather subjective. Sure it’s a slightly bigger,thicker, heavier phone than the 6 but if that means a bigger battery withbetter longevity is it really a loss?The headphone jack’s absence is annoying for some but the phone comes with anadapter and the in-display fingerprint sensor might not have fit in the samefootprint otherwise. The base price has been upped from £469 to £499 but youactually get twice the internal storage for less than what you would have paidfor the same configuration on the OnePlus 6.With all these factors, the OnePlus 6T serves itself up as a worthwhileupgrade. If you’re using a [OnePlus5](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/oneplus-5) or even a[5T](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/oneplus-5t), the 6T is worthconsidering.The camera still needs a little work to be truly competitive and OnePlus isfacing stiffer competition than ever before but these are factors I’m sure thecompany is well aware of. So long as that’s the case, we should have goodthings to look forward to next year.**Pre-order:[OnePlus 6T from £499 from OnePlusStore](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=10937&clickref=tr-oneplus6t&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Fuk%2F6t%3Ffrom%3Dcarousel)**## VerdictThe OnePlus 6T brings new technology and worthwhile improvements to the tablebut still needs some tweaking.## Score"}
