And you can turn Low Power on earlier if youknow you have a long day ahead – the iPhone 6S runs fine when it’s on.Ultimately, while some management is needed from time to time, I never feltlike I would run out before I got home, and it would only concern me if I wason a “night out” and got home late. In those cases, a few simple precautionswill avert problems.Power users who stream video all day, use navigation lots or play games oftenshould look at the 6S Plus, but the 6S’s battery life is fine for the majorityof people.## **Why buy the iPhone 6S?**For the current RRP of £449, the iPhone 6S is far too expensive. There’s justtoo many better options out there for the same price. iOS 12 will likely makeit a much better device, but that isn’t here yet and there are notableperformance problems on older iPhones with iOS 11.**Related:[How to download iOS 12](https://www.trustedreviews.com/how-to/ios-12-beta-download-3481261)**If you can pick the iPhone 6S up cheaper and you simply must have an iOS phonethen you might even see benefits with installing the iOS 12 public beta.## **Verdict**Still good in many ways, but it’ll benefit a lot from iOS 12.## Score  ### Score in detail  * Performance 10  * Camera 9  * Design 9  * Battery Life 7  * Value 8  * Software 9  * Calls & Sound 8  * Screen Quality 9"}
