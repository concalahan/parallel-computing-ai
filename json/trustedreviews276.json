It’s\nbrief, but the latest look at things we have.\n\n## Days Gone Story – What’s it about?\n\nDeacon St. John is a man who prefers to live in the dangerous outside world\nthan the confines of civilian encampments, even if it means dealing with\nhordes of relentless infected. Taking place two years after a global pandemic\noverwhelmed civilization, turning millions into mindless zombies known as\n‘Freakers.’ They’re fast, relentless and arguably unstoppable.\n\nThe narrative hook of Days Gone is still unclear, but we imagine it’ll involve\nexploring a sprawling open world in search of a cure or something. Imagine\nDays of Anarchy spliced with The Last of Us.\n\n**Related:[Upcoming PS4 Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/upcoming-\nps4-games) **\n\n![days\ngone](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Days Gone Gameplay – How does it play?\n\nDays Gone is set in a vast open-world where the player is free to approach\nlocations and objectives in a multitude of different ways. You can approach\nenemies using aggression or stealth depending on your current circumstances,\ninfluenced hugely by resources, health and abilities.\n\nThe land is huge, and thus areas will be filled with different variations of\n‘Freakers,’ Days Gone’s terminology for zombies, so you’ll need to be keenly\naware of hordes prowling about the place, You can use these to ambush enemies\nif you’re smart enough, drawing their attention before unleashing hell upon\nthe masses.\n\nCarrying two weapons alongside a variety of equipment such as Molotov\nCocktails, healing items and axes, your loadout is capable of tackling most\nscenarios with ease. They also grant a method of unique creativity if you’re\neager to experiment with different approaches of murder.\n\n**Related:[Best PS4\nGames](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/ps4-games-3431751)**\n\n![days\ngone](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nDeacon is a biker, and thus his motorcycle acts a primary form of\ntransportation throughout the game’s setting: The Pacific Northwest. It’s a\ncharacter in itself and will need to be cared for and repaired as you\nprogress. Failing to upgrade means you’ll be left in the dust and a vulnerable\nmeal to the encroaching infected.\n\nCombine this with a dynamic weather system which spans all parts of the day\nand you’ve a recipe for a world which reacts to every little thing you do. The\nsame consequence applies to the narrative which incorporates player choice\nwill influence the outcome of quests and more.\n\n_**Like what you’ve seen so far for Days Gone?
