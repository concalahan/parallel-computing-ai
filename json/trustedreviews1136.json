With theannouncement of a ‘strategic relationship’ around mobile technology, thisseems unlikely to change.Which is good news for Samsung, and bad news for everyone else.More intriguingly, this new paradigm could have a big impact on the mobileprocessor space. While Qualcomm’s Snapdragon chips are the household name –“My phone has the new MediaTek chip,” bragged nobody ever – playing secondfiddle to Samsung isn’t exactly a sustainable business model.Could Huawei-owned HiSilicon (maker of the Kirin line of SoCs) or theaforementioned MediaTek quietly benefit from the deal? And what does it meanfor Samsung’s own Exynos line of chips, which feature in the Galaxy devices wetypically get in the UK?While the world’s first 5G phone may well have been cleared for take-off,Samsung and Qualcomm’s seemingly mundane ‘strategic partnership’ leaves uswith just as many questions as it does answers.**Related:[Best phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-phone)**_**Do you agree or disagree with James’ crystal ball gazing?
