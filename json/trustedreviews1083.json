Nice and easy!\n\nPlayers won’t gain access to\n[Forsaken](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/destiny-2-forsaken), the\ntitle’s latest expansion, but the entire base experience for completely free\nis a hard offer to pass up.\n\nThis seems like an attempt by Activision to grow the shooter’s player\npopulation of PC while increasing interest in Forsaken, which is an admittedly\nexcellent expansion.\n\nEarning 8/10 in our review, we found it to be a worthwhile addition to the\nseries while really building upon the weaker elements of Destiny 2:\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n**Related:**[ **Overwatch Ashe – First\nLook**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/gaming/overwatch-ashe-release-\ndate-3614718)\n\n‘Destiny is always going to have its haters, and so much comes down to how\nmuch you love the core action, the all-absorbing grind, the unmatched feel of\nthe gunplay and your tools for wreaking havoc. But if you love those things,\nthen buy Forsaken. It takes us straight back to the glory days of The Taken\nKing.’\n\n**Will you be picking up Destiny 2 for free on PC this November.
