That was until it became\nclear that the difference between the Apple Watch Series 2 and Apple Watch\nSeries 3 was not that pronounced.\n\n**Related:[Apple Watch Series 3 vs Apple Watch Series\n2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-watch-3-vs-apple-\nwatch-2-3286324)**\n\nIt therefore made perfect sense to keep the cheaper Apple Watch Series 1 model\naround as an alternative for those not wanting to spend big money on the\nlatest model. So with two models of Apple Watch still on sale, you might be\nwondering what the differences are.\n\nThankfully, this article will answer just that very question.\n\n## Apple Watch 3 vs Apple Watch 1 – Design and display\n\n![Apple Watch Series\n3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nWhile the Apple Watch has gone through multiple iterations, one thing has\nremained consistent all the way back to the first model: the design. Apple is\nstill one of few companies to stick to a squared-off design when everyone else\nis opting for circular faces. There are still 38mm and 42mm options for both\nmodels, catering for different wrist sizes or those who prefer smaller or\nlarger watch faces.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nOwing to having more tech inside (which I’ll come to), the newer Apple Watch\nSeries 3 is thicker than the Series 1, but there’s really not much in it\nunless you’re really looking.\n\nRemaining consistent is the rotating digital crown on the side of the watch.\nNot only does the rotating crown let you scroll through lists and menus, it\nacts as a button and a shortcut to your last-used app. The Series 3 also has\nan instantly recognisable red digital crown for the more expensive LTE model,\ntoo.\n\nBelow this is a side button that provides access to your other recent or\nfavourite apps. A double press activates Apple Pay, too. There’s also a heart\nrate monitor on the back of both models.\n\n**Related:[Fitbit Ionic review](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/fitbit-\nionic)**\n\n![Apple Watch Series\n3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nWhere the big difference arises is around the display, namely around\nbrightness. Both models have the same resolution 272 x 340 pixels (38mm) or\n312 x 390 pixels (42mm) OLED displays, but the Series 3 is much, much\nbrighter. More than double in fact.\n\nWhere the Series 1 makes do with a 450 nits brightness screen, the Series 3\ncan reach 1000 nits. That makes the Series 3 much easier to view when outdoors\nunder bright sunlight. For comparison, that’s as bright as a good HDR-enabled\nTV can go. It’s a very tangible improvement.\n\nThe other major difference between models is around water resistance. Where\nthe Apple Watch Series 1 is only splash-resistant – meaning you shouldn’t\nshower let alone swim with it – the Apple Watch Series 3 can handle being\nsubmerged to 50 metres and makes for a great swimming companion.\n\n## Apple Watch 3 vs Apple Watch 1 – Sensors and specifications\n\n![Apple Watch Series\n3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nWhen Apple debuted the Apple Watch Series 2, it quietly announced the original\nApple Watch had also been upgraded as the Apple Watch Series 1 (which is the\nmodel that remains on sale today). The big change was to the processor running\nthe show, which got upgraded to a dual-core S1P, delivering double the\nperformance of the original.\n\nFor the Apple Watch Series 3, Apple revealed a new S3 processor, which offers\n70% more performance than the S1P seen in the Apple Watch Series 1. While apps\ndo indeed open faster than before, the main reason for that extra grunt is to\nnow let Siri talk back through the Apple Watch Series 3’s speaker. Now when\nyou ask the digital assistant a question or make a request, you’ll get certain\nresponses back audibly, whereas you’ll just be staring at your screen with the\nSeries 1. While it’s a useful convenience, not having it isn’t exactly a deal\nbreaker.\n\nThe Series 3 has the distinct advantage elsewhere, though, especially for\nfitness enthusiasts. This is because it contains both a GPS/GLONASS sensor and\nan altimeter. This means accurate location tracking without the need for a\nphone, as well as elevation data for flights of stairs you climb or hills you\nsprint up. It makes for much richer information for your workouts and\nactivity.\n\n**Related:[What is HIIT?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/hiit-\nworkouts-2951271)**\n\n![Apple Watch\n3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nFinally, LTE was the headline feature of the new Series 3. The Apple Watch\nSeries 3 is available in two models: the Apple Watch Series 3 GPS + Cellular\nand the cheaper Apple Watch Series 3 + GPS. The former will require you to\ntake out a separate smartwatch data plan but means your Apple Watch Series 3\ncan have its own LTE connection for always-on connectivity (wherever you have\nreception).\n\nThis makes for a more phone-free experience, ensuring you can still make and\nreceive calls and messages, or any other activity that requires a data\nconnection, without your phone in tow. By using an eSIM the Apple Watch Series\n3 will share the same phone number as your iPhone, too.\n\nThere’s also a difference in storage capacity depending on model, too. While\nthe Series 1 and Series 3 + GPS both have 8GB of storage, you actually get\n16GB if you opt for the priciest Series 3 GPS + Cellular option. That means\nmore space for your Apple Music library.\n\n**Related:[What is VO2 Max?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/what-is-\nvo2-max-2954082)**\n\n## Apple Watch 3 vs Apple Watch 1 – Battery life\n\nBoth models should offer the same battery life under the same conditions –\nnamely Apple rates this at 18 hours of mixed usage. I’ve actually found this\nrather conservative and often hit two days of light use. It’s when you use the\nGPS and LTE of the Series 3 that battery life is considerably shorter. You can\nexpect about 5 hours of GPS tracking or 4 hours when using both GPS and LTE,\nfor example.\n\n## Apple Watch 3 vs Apple Watch 1 – Price and value for money\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 1 is available from £249 (38mm) or £279 (42mm). The\nApple Watch Series 3 GPS starts from £329 (38mm) or £359 (42mm). The Apple\nWatch Series 3 GPS + LTE starts from £399 (38mm) or £429 (42mm).\n\n**Related:[Best smartwatches](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nsmartwatch)**\n\n![Apple\nWatch](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nWhile not everyone will want to spend extra for the GPS + LTE model of the\nApple Watch Series 3, the leap from the Series 1 to the cheapest Series 3\nmodel is pretty big. The display is considerably better thanks to the\nbrightness, performance is boosted and the GPS and altimeter are worth it for\nexercise fans. That’s not forgetting the water-resistance. Even if you’re not\na swimmer you’ll appreciate not having to take your Apple Watch off to shower.\n\nIf you can stretch, I’d say it’s worth going for the Apple Watch Series 3 +\nGPS if you can.\n\n**Related:[Apple Watch Series 3 vs Fitbit\nIonic](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-watch-3-vs-fitbit-\nionic-3286344)**\n\n## Apple Watch 3 vs Apple Watch 1 summary – What’s the difference?\n\nFor a quick breakdown of the key differences between the two smartwatches,\nhere’s what you need to know.\n\n**Design:** The design is almost identical, with only a tiny, fractional\nchange in size. Considering everything that’s squeezed into the Apple Watch 3,\nthat’s pretty impressive. The LTE version of the Apple Watch 3 can easily be\nidentified by the red digital crown. The Series 3 has the much brighter\ndisplay.\n\n**Specs:** The Apple Watch 3 promises 70% faster performance than the S1P\nprocessor in the Series 1. There’s also 85% better Wi-Fi performance and 50%\nbetter wireless energy efficiency. The Series 3 also includes an LTE cellular\nconnection for the first time and an altimeter for elevation data during\noutdoor activities.\n\n**Battery life:** Battery life is said to be the same between both models.\n\n**Price:** The Apple Watch 3 will cost $329/£329 (38mm) £369/$369 (42mm) for\nnon-cellular and $399/£399 (38mm) £429/$429 (42mm) for the LTE model. The\nApple Watch 1 is available for £249 (38mm) or £279 (42mm).\n\n**What do you think? Are you going to go for an Apple Watch Series 1 or Apple\nWatch Series 3?
