Waze reckons this type of mapping and data\nsharing will help speed up commutes, thus reducing fuel consumption.\n\n“Our goal is to bring a human-centered approach to technology in the vehicle,\nmaking it as easy as possible for people to integrate the tools that matter\nmost to them,” said Don Butler, Ford executive director at its Connected\nVehicle and Services division.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n“With the flexibility of our Sync 3 software and AppLink, customers can easily\nuse Waze to get all the traffic and navigation help they need – on a big\nscreen, and without having to fiddle around with their phones while driving.”\n\nWaze had been available in Ford cars that support Android Auto, but direct\nintegration with Sync 3 means iPhones can also pipe Waze to the infotainment\nunit without having to rely on [Apple’s\nCarPlay](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/bbc-iplayer-radio-on-android-\nauto-and-apple-carplay-3309090) interface. Although more widespread than a few\nyears ago, CarPlay can’t yet be found across all the major car brands.\n\nThe Waze integration into Sync 3 is pretty much the opposite of the high-end\ncar tech and machines being showcased at CES 2018. Nevertheless, it shows that\ndriver-orientated connected car tech is growing, despite driverless cars\nsupposedly being just round the corner.\n\n**What features would you like to see Ford add into its infotainment systems?\nHave your say on our Facebook page or tweet @TrustedReviews.**\n\n"}
