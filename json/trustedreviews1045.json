In essence, Google says\nthis isn’t a problem. It is by design.**\n\nThe statement is as follows:\n\n> We made several advances in the audio recording capabilities of Pixel 3,\nincluding enabling stereo recording in landscape mode. When recording\noutdoors, our tuning is specifically designed to reduce background noise like\nwind and road noise and overly loud sounds and optimize for audible speech. To\nachieve this, we selectively de-emphasize some frequencies, which minimizes\ndisruptive noises and optimizes the resulting audio. We do extensive user\ntesting of our products to ensure they are tuned for real world usage, and\nwe’re always looking at additional tuning opportunities based on user feedback\n\n_Original story continues below…_\n\n**The[Google Pixel 3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-\npixel-3-xl) and Pixel 3 XL handsets are reportedly suffering from an audio\nquality issue when recording video – a problem that also plagued one of the\npair’s predecessors.**\n\nThe issue has been picked-up in early tests by a pair of YouTubers’ video\nreviews of the device (via\n[AndroidPolice](https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/18/deja-vu-pixel-3-3-xl-\nvideo-recordings-poor-audio/)), suggesting Google is still lagging behind some\nof its rivals in this department.\n\nIn his video comparison with the iPhone Xs Max, the reviewer [SuperSaf\nTV](https://youtu.be/S9qNHYtNsik) negatively compared the Pixel 3 XL’s\nrecorded audio quality with Apple’s largest and latest smartphone. Meanwhile,\nanother tech vlogger Jerome Ortega also noted the tinny and distant quality\nwhen recording video, while using the front facing camera. You can see the\ncomparison directly in Ortega’s video below.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThese videos back-up complaints from early Pixel 3 buyers, who’ve complained\nabout the audio quality when recording video using their new smartphone.\n\n**Related:[Google Pixel 3 vs Pixel\n2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-pixel-3-vs-pixel-2-3601728)**\n\nLast year Google addressed the problem with a software update, so it’s likely\nthe company will do so once again this time around. However, given the issues\nin 2017, it’s concerning that nailing this feature wasn’t a priority for the\nPixel 3 launch.\n\nThe issue also appears to be slightly different this time around. The Pixel 2\nXL audio recording in video mode appeared to be high pitched and distorted,\nuntil it was fixed by a Google software update. It’s also strange that the\nGoogle phones are being plagued by such an issue given the quality of the\ncameras is one of the Pixel range’s main selling points.\n\nOrtega points out: “If Google doesn’t get this audio/microphone recording\nfixed, this is going to be a problem. If you’re big into video and it’s a\npriority, I’d hold off on the Pixel 3 until we get an update.”\n\n**Have you noticed any issues with the Pixel 3 or Pixel 3 XL since you picked\nup the handsets?
