It’s\nexpected to ship in Q4, alongside Google’s upcoming Android M operating\nsystem.\n\nOf course, we still don’t have official confirmation from Google, LG or Huawei\nthat any of these rumoured handsets are actually happening, so do take all of\nthese leaks with a pinch of salt.\n\nIf you can’t wait until Q4 for your next smartphone, you should check out our\nhandset group test video:\n\n"}
