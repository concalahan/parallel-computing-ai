But again, it’s ten years.”\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nNvidia currently builds computing systems for cars, and is developing\ntechnology for a self-driving future.\n\nThe firm, best known for its graphics cards, has a number of partners in the\ncar space, including Audi, BMW, and Daimler.\n\nBut despite widespread speculation, Apple has yet to announce plans for a\nvehicle publicly.\n\nThat’s despite mounting evidence that suggests Apple is currently developing\nan electric – and possibly autonomous – vehicle.\n\n![Porsche Mission\nE](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)Porsche Mission E supercar, powered by Nvidia  \n **  \nRelated:[Apple CarPlay vs Android\nAuto](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/apple-carplay-vs-android-auto)**\n\nDo you think Apple has the capability to build a successful vehicle franchise?\nLet us know in the comments.\n\n"}
