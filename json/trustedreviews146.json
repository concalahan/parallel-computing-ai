While some entries in the franchise\nremain exclusive to its homeland, recent months have seen it explode in\npopularity following the celebrated release of [Yakuza\n0](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/yakuza-0).\n\nAs someone who fell in love with Yakuza before it was cool, it’s a joy to see\nit embraced so lovingly – and by so many. And it’s the perfect time to jump in\nas SEGA retraces its steps through a back catalogue that the majority of\nplayers are yet to discover.\n\nYakuza Kiwami 2 reintroduces the 2006 classic with far more than a simple\nremaster. Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has crafted a bespoke experience using the same\ntechnology as its [sixth\ninstalment](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/yakuza-6), and it looks,\nplays and tells a story so beautifully I can’t help but recommend it.\n\n**Related:**[ **Upcoming PS4\ngames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/upcoming-ps4-games-3530401)\n\n![yakuza kiwami 2\n](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nOriginally released in 2006, Yakuza 2 was a swansong for the PlayStation 2\namidst a world that was moving into the HD generation, and it showed. It still\nsported an iconic, recognisable aesthetic, but simply couldn’t compete with\nthe advancements sprinting out ahead of it. It’s also incredibly hard to get\nhold of now, with used copies going for a minimum of £60 at the time of\nwriting.\n\nSo, Kiwami 2 is a second chance of sorts, and a new opportunity for budding\nfans to follow the story that began in [Yakuza\nKiwami](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/yakuza-kiwami). After\nabandoning his role in the Tojo Clan to become a normal civilian, it’s only a\nmatter of time until Kazuma Kiryu is thrust back into the corrupt underworld\nthat had a hand in creating him.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Spintires: Mudrunners – American Wilds Edition\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/spintires-mudrunners-american-wilds-\nedition \"Spintires: Mudrunners – American Wilds Edition\")\n\n  * [ ![Galaxy Note 10](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Best Phone 2018: 10 best smartphones revealed and rated\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-smartphone-3431175 \"Best Phone\n2018: 10 best smartphones revealed and rated\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Wooting One Keyboard](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Wooting One\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/wooting-one \"Wooting One\")\n\n  * \n\nThis time, it involves the assassination of his clan’s chairman, a cataclysmic\nevent that descends into a brilliantly conspiratorial tale with abundant\ntwists and turns. Much like Kiwami, this is a shot-for-shot remake of the\noriginal, with few exceptions. Cut-scenes adopt the same editorial direction,\nwhile major events remain mostly untouched.\n\nThis is a blessing and a curse, as archaic techniques and rusty encounter\ndesign lingers despite the otherwise gorgeous visual presentation. It can take\na few seconds for transitions into gameplay to occur, leaving you lingering\nawkwardly as the pacing seems to play catch-up. This was a noticeable flaw\nthroughout, alongside inconsistent performance on PS4 Pro, although it\ndefinitely isn’t a deal-breaker.\n\n**Related;**[ **Best Xbox One\ngames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/xbox-one-games-3435271)\n\n![yakuza kiwami 2\n](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nTechnical issues aside, Kiwami 2 is a pleasure to play. Combat is brutal and\nsatisfying, adopting a near-identical system to Yakuza 6 with a singular\nfighting style expanded with multiple upgrade paths and special moves to\nunlock. While nearing the narrative conclusion, I still found myself\ndiscovering new ways to obliterate thugs who dared cross the Dragon of\nDojima’s path.\n\nHeat Moves make a return. These hilariously violent techniques are activated\nwith a press of the triangle button, contextually sensitive depending on\nweapons or environments in which you find yourself. A new addition to Kiwami 2\nare allies, citizens across Kamurocho and Sotenbori who will throw Kiryu a\nweapon when instructed, if you’ve finished the necessary sidequests to unlock\nthem.\n\nOf course, these are predictably ridiculous with octopus, guitars and even\nbowls of ramen being hurled at enemies. Kiwami 2’s combat system isn’t\noverflowing with depth, and you can conquer most encounters with the same\nstring of combos. Despite this, it remains engaging throughout, never failing\nto satisfy. Combine this with a rewarding progression system and it’s hard to\nreally complain about.\n\n**Related:**[ **Best PS4\nGames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/ps4-games-3431751)\n\n![yakuza kiwami 2\n](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nExploration once again plays an integral part in Kiwami 2, and both locations\nwill be familiar to series veterans in the form of Tokyo’s Kamurocho and\nOsaka’s Sotenbori. The former haunting ground feels like an old home after so\nmany years, the layout burnt into my brain like the council estate I grew up\non. It’s almost nostalgic to walk its streets, knowing exactly where I’m going\nand why.\n\nThis fond familiarity also supersedes any criticisms I’d have with SEGA\nreusing the same environments with each passing entry. Kamurocho is a\ncharacter in itself in the Yakuza universe, playing an important role in the\nnarrative as you bounce between buildings and characters with whom Kazuma\nKiryu has established relationships.\n\nThe Red Light District looks like the real thing, too. If you’re a firm\nbeliever in virtual tourism, this is the next best thing ahead of booking a\nflight to Tokyo. Sotenbori shouldn’t be ignored either, since it presents an\nequally wonderful rendition of Osaka’s Dotonbori district, with all the\nvibrant excessiveness you’d expect of it.\n\nKiwami 2 establishes a sense of place that still feels unrivalled in its\nattention to detail. Streets, buildings and the citizens that occupy them feel\nalive and reactive to Kazuma Kiryu’s actions, whether he bumbles across them\nin the street or aids them in one of the game’s many sub-stories.\n\n**Related:**[ **Upcoming Nintendo Switch\ngames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/upcoming-nintendo-switch-\ngames-3522184)\n\n![yakuza kiwami 2\n](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nActing as a form of side quest, sub-stories are wacky and unpredictable\nescapades in the life of Kazuma Kiryu. You might find yourself indulging the\nawful mixtape of an amateur rapper, or fighting off a horde of Yakuza\nindulging in obscure fetish play. Kiryu doesn’t kink-shame, but he won’t\nhesitate to let the fists fly if someone steps out of line. And yes, it does\nget pretty weird.\n\nSide stories are complimented by a generous array of mini-games scattered\nacross the cities of Kamurocho and Sotenbori. You can dive into the arcades\nfor a cheeky session of Virtua Fighter 2, hit the Batting Cages, or even\ncompete in a Cabaret Club tournament that can absorb hours of your time.\nThat’s just the tip of the iceberg of what Yakuza Kiwami has to offer.\n\nOnce you’ve poured hours into Kazuma Kiryu’s journey, you’ll begin to unlock\nchapters in the Goro Majima Saga. This mode is an entire campaign in itself,\nintroducing a new playable character with his own combat options, missions and\nmore. Once again, the attention to detail is admirable, and delving into a fan\nfavourite character from a new perspective is a treat.\n\nI won’t spoil anything further, as the silly amount of surprises hidden among\nthe depths of Yakuza Kiwami 2 are worth discovering for yourself, and I’m\npretty sure a handful have already slipped under my nose.\n\n## Verdict\n\nYakuza Kiwami 2 is another spectacular entry in the long-running series. It\nbrings the 2006 classic into the modern generation with gorgeous visuals,\nengaging combat and a melodramatic story that hits all the right notes.\n\nThe sheer amount of content on offer across multiple modes and cities is an\nachievement in itself, made even better by the way in which Kiwami 2\nunashamedly bathes players in the culture that inspired it.\n\nKazuma Kiryu’s journey may have concluded in Yakuza 6, but the way in which\nSEGA is allowing players to experience his entire story with so few obstacles\nis a joy to see.\n\n## Score\n\n  \n\n"}
