But here we are.\n\nOne61 Studio has created three smartwatches based around Batman, The Flash and\nWonder Woman, with the lineup really geared towards massive fans of those\ncomic book franchises. Probably the type of person who would buy the\nmerchandise from One61 Studio’s parent company, Bioworld Merchandising Inc.\n\n![Batman\nSmartwatch](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAre you after a Batman smartwatch to match your Batman backpack, Batman wallet\nand Batmam pyjamas? Then read on.\n\nSo, since these are smartwatches, they come with the basic stable of features\nyou’d expect of a wearable that isn’t running a fully fledged OS such as\nAndroid Wear, watchOS or Tizen. These include message notifications, the\nability to take calls from your wrist, plus music and camera controls.\n\n![Batman\nSmartwatch](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThere’s also fitness tracking by way of step counting and sleep monitoring. Of\ncourse, all the menus and interactions are skinned in a way to match your\nchosen superhero of choice. If you opt for The Flash, you’ll receive move\nalerts based around “metahuman alerts”. One61 wants to gamify the fitness side\nby providing more character content when you reach certain step milestones\nthroughout the day.\n\n![Batman\nSmartwatch](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe Batman smartwatch, which is based around the 1960s _Batman_ television\nseries, will let you defeat the Joker by getting enough steps in. Similarly,\nThe Flash Smartwatch will play clips from the recent television show for\nreaching milestones throughout the day.\n\n![Batman\nSmartwatch](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe Batman and The Flash models will retail for $129; the Wonder Woman model\nis a little pricier at $149 when it launches later in the year, but will also\ninclude a heart rate monitor.\n\nOne61 Studio says to expect more tie-in smartwatches down the line, including\nmodels based on Rick and Morty.\n\n**What do you think of these superhero smartwatches?
