My only slight issue is that the maximum brightness isn’t quiteas high as that of the Galaxy S8. This isn’t a huge disaster, as 99% of thetime you won’t want the display maxed out. It only becomes an annoyance whenusing the U11 outdoors in direct sunlight, or very bright indoor areas, wherethe screen can become fairly reflective. Being fair to HTC, though, this is anissue I experience with the majority of phones I review.[ Next  Software and performance](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/htc-u11-software-and-performance-page-2)"}
