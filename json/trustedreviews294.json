Yet this is where we are: the latest instalment in a shooter\nseries renowned for its Nazi-slaying anti-fascist themes is met with a rousing\nchorus from certain segments of the internet over its unflattering portrayal\nof the 20th century’s greatest villains.\n\nThankfully, The New Colossus is a very effective PSA on the evils of Nazism.\nAlthough the alternative history of this universe leads to exagerrated war\nmachines and dieselpunk nightmares beyond what the Third Reich had in reality,\nthe twisted terrors encountered during the course of Wolfenstein II aren’t\nterribly far removed from the horrifying experiments conducted by the likes of\nJosef Mengele.\n\n[**Order Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus from\nAmazon**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Wolfenstein-II-Colossus-Welcome-\nAmerika/dp/B0749QJHZX/ref=sr_1_1?s=videogames&ie=UTF8&qid=1509453295&sr=1-1&keywords=wolfenstein+2)\n\nWhere the game really excels though is in using its over-the-top, extreme take\non the subject matter to examine how the evils of Nazi ideology can fester in\neveryday life. From hero Billy “B.J.” Blazkowicz’s childhood dealing with his\nfather’s abuse and violent racism – delivered in fever-dream flashbacks as he\nrecovers from the events of 2014’s [Wolfenstein: The New Order\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/wolfenstein-the-new-order)– to\nportrayals of life in this divergent 1961 America where Klansmen and SS\nofficers walk the streets, it’s a chilling reminder of how people’s quiet\nconcessions to smaller atrocities pave the way for worse to come.\n\n**Related:[Best PS4 games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nps4-games)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nWolfenstein II is also unapologetic about making the player face those\ncruelties, a luxury that can only really be afforded or indulged in with\nsingle player experiences like this. At crucial points, it forces you to not\nonly observe but interact with shocking, soul-gnawing moments.\n\nYou’ll be forced to make decisions where either outcome is horrifying, with a\nbranching story line that reflects the bad-or-bad decisions you’ve made.\nPerversely, when The New Colossus does pivot to battles against giant\nPanzerhunds trying to tear you to pieces with their cartoonish maws, or mowing\ndown entire squadrons of Nazi stormtroopers, it seems almost light-hearted in\ncomparison.\n\nIt’s not all heavy-handed moralising though. Mechanically, this improves on\nits predecessor without dropping the delightfully old-school first-person\nshooter model. Forget the likes of Halo or Call of Duty with their realistic\n(read: boring) weapon limits: Blazkowicz seemingly has infinite carry space\nand can swap between weapons at will, even dual-wielding for double damage.\nDoes it make sense? No. Is it immensely satisfying to be a one-man gun locker?\nYes.\n\nIn fact, one of the game’s few disappointments is that the arsenal on offer\nisn’t weirder. Sure, there are triple-barrel revolving shotguns and the\noccasional laser rifle or plasma cannon – all deliriously out-of-place – and\nsome truly special but sadly limited-use weapons at key points, but it feels\nat times that developer MachineGames was almost restrained in some of their\nfever-dream weapons.\n\nThere is an improvement to the stealth elements, though. It’s not at Metal\nGear Solid levels, but given enemies will call for reinforcements when you’re\nspotted, it’s wise to thin the herd of an area before fully wading in. The\nability to set traps, or activate ones left by the friendly Resistance, also\nbrings a sadistic glee when a horde of fascists wanders right into them.\n\nLater, upgrades that allow you to specialise in stealth, melee, and height\nboosts to gain tactical advantage expand our hero’s combat skills even\nfurther, turning him into a Nazi-crushing machine – just as the new Reich,\nlead by a returning Frau Engel, starts unleashing even tougher soldiers and\nmore deranged tech to test your skills against.\n\n**Related:[Best Xbox One games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nxbox-one-games)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThose skills can be enhanced with perks and weapon upgrades. The former are\nawarded for completing actions such as a string of headshots or chained\nstealth kills, and unlock various play modifiers and bonuses, while the latter\nlet you improve your arsenal, but are extremely limited and force careful\nconsideration of which beloved boomstick you’ll boost. However, Wolfenstein\nII’s power creep is always competently met with an increase in enemy\ndifficulty, and odds that somehow still feel insurmountable at times.\n\nLevels are also improved when compared to the previous game, losing some of\nthe linearity in favour of bigger areas to explore. There can be multiple\nroutes to an objective, and as many ways of achieving it – wiping out enemies,\nmeticulously taking out officers, or avoiding as many foes as possible en\nroute, for instance.\n\nEnemies, for their part, also do a very gratifying job of dying. They’ll react\nto where they’ve been shot – a reaction that is itself a nice side effect of\nWolfenstein II letting you shoot armour or helmets off to deal more damage –\nand almost overact when they keel over. It’s a nice touch that bolsters\nWolfenstein II’s cheerily gory grindhouse credentials, without feeling\ngratuitous for the genre.\n\nYet for all that effort in grunt enemy animation, there are several moments\nwhere main characters look strangely off-model, or move weirdly in cutscenes.\nI can’t quite put my finger on what exactly makes them look so odd, but the\nvisual consistency and animation fluidity isn’t quite what it should be, and\nthe effect can jar you out of key moments.\n\n**Related:[Xbox One X vs PS4 Pro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/xbox-\none-x-vs-ps4-pro-2993235)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIt’s a minor road bump on the path to saving America from fascism, though, and\neven once you’ve cleared that goal there’s more to do. For a single-player\ngame, The New Colossus packs in tonnes of end-game material, from optional\nassassination missions to ways to obtain weapons locked out by story choices\non your main playthrough.\n\nDespite its unapologetic violence and disturbing moments, Wolfenstein II\nproves an almost joyous experience at times. It celebrates the best in\nhumanity while simultaneously damning our worst impulses. It might drag you\nthrough an emotional gauntlet, but you’ll have a whole lot of fun on the way.\n\n## **Verdict**\n\nA far deeper game than its B-movie stylings would imply at a glance,\nWolfenstein II also delights with its fast-paced, creative first-person\nwarfare. Its tongue-in-cheek social commentary is heavy-handed, but there are\nfew other games where mowing down the bad guys feels so cathartic or\nwarranted. The New Colossus also pulls off the rare trick of being a sequel\nthat more than lives up to the standard set by its predecessor, making this a\nreal treat for returning players. Not to be missed.\n\n## Score\n\n  \n\n"}
