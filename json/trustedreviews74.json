It’s taking on the likes of the[Amazon Echo]()The HomePod’s already wide soundstage is expandedfurther when you combine two together. They can fill a large room more thanadequately and sound great wherever you’re located. The sweet spots are largeand I found top volume too loud in the 25m2 room I was testing in. That’s nota problem I have with a single HomePod.And as with a single HomePod there’s no distortion, such as clipping, even atfull blast.## Why buy the Apple HomePod?If you want the slickest smart speaker around, the HomePod isn’t it. But ifyou’ve totally bought into the Apple ecosystem and value audio quality aboveall, then the HomePod is second to none.The price is a stumbling block, however. Add a little more to the HomePod’s£319/$349 asking price and you can actually buy two wireless Sonos One smartspeakers. Individually they don’t sound as good as the HomePod, but they’renot miles off, and stereo pairing makes them very tempting.Nevertheless, there’s one factor that gives me cause for optimism for thefuture of the HomePod. Apple tends to evolve software well after launching anew product. AirPlay 2, which has now been released, enables multiroom andstereo pairing. Another example is how far the new Apple TV and theaccompanying tvOS have come since they launched in 2016.However, as it currently stands, the HomePod is flawed.## VerdictThe HomePod sounds so good that I can forgive its price tag, but there arecurrently too many usability issues to rate it as a great smart speaker.## Score"}
