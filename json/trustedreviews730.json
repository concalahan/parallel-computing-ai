A more durable bodyUnlike many, we’re fans of the Google Pixel’s design. It’s not the thinnestnor the lightest, but it’s well built and manageable even if you plump for thelarger model. We have noticed though that the metal used seems very to scratchand dent very easily. Even without dropping our Pixel XL, the corners andsides have got increasingly dinged.Considering its likely high starting price, it seems only right that Googleshould improve its components and give us a much tougher device.### 4\\. Water resistance is a mustThe Google Pixel matches, and in most cases supersedes, flagships from Sony,Apple and Samsung in many areas but it’s still lacking something.A high IP rating (either IP67 or IP68) means you can dunk your phone in abouta metre of water without any actual damage, and it’s a feature the GooglePixel 2 simply must have to compete with the Samsung Galaxy S8 and iPhone 7(or iPhone 7S/iPhone 8).### 5\\. Better audio throughoutOne of the Pixels few shortcoming are its downward facing and rather tinnyspeakers. Often a forgotten feature on phones – normally to save space – welove good speakers and DACs on phones.The HTC U11 has great audio, and it does make a big difference especially onmedia centric phones with large screens. Considering the current Pixel has athick bezel running around the display, there should be enough room to jam insome decent front-firing speakers. Oh, and keep the headphone jack.
