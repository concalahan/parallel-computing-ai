Here’s what we know\nso far, including the expected LG Nexus 5’s release date, new features and the\nlatest info on specs.**\n\nWhen LG worked with Google on the original [Nexus\n5](https://www.trustedreviews.com/google-nexus-5-review), it felt as though\nthe smartphone stars had aligned.\n\nFeaturing specs traditionally seen on handsets close to twice its price, the\noriginal LG Nexus 5 was serious value for money.\n\nAs such, imagine the delight of Android fans everywhere when the rumour mill\nstarted churning out talk of a new LG Nexus smartphone for 2015.\n\nUnfortunately, Google is keeping the next-gen LG Nexus 5 – or possibly Nexus\n5X – under tight wraps, so we have only leaks, rumours, and speculation to\nwork with right now.\n\nHowever, Google’s big product launch is scheduled for 29 September, so the\ndevices are imminent.\n\n**_Update: Hours ahead of launch, we’ve hit upon the motherlode of leaks,\nrevealing what looks very likely to be the entire spec sheet for the Nexus\n5X._**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera

**What’s new about the LG Nexus 5?**\n_Marshmallow,[USB-C](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/usb-type-c-\neverything-you-need-to-know), fingerprint scanner._  \n **How much will the LG Nexus 5 cost?** _£300-500._\n\n**Related:[Best Android Smartphones 2015](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-\nandroid-phones-1_round-up)**\n\n## When will the LG Nexus 5 come out?\n\nRegarding an unveiling, we’ve already been given a huge clue by Google. The\ncompany has invited us, and many other members of the press, to a special\nproduct launch event on September 29.\n\nThat fits with other rumours suggesting Google’s next Nexus devices will\nactually go on sale at some point in October.\n\nUnfortunately, Google is staying tight-lipped on both its plans for the event,\nas well as release details for any upcoming handsets.\n\nOne of the best indicators for the Nexus 5 (2015) release date are the\nlaunches of previous Google handsets.\n\nWhat’s notable about the series is that the [Galaxy\nNexus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-nexus-review), the [Nexus\n4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/google-nexus-4-review), the [Nexus\n5](https://www.trustedreviews.com/google-nexus-5-review), and the [Nexus\n6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/nexus-6-review) all launched in October –\nthat’s going all the way back to 2011.\n\nAs such, we’d expect Google to adopt a similar strategy with the new Nexus 5\nand pencil in an October launch.\n\nThat theory is seconded by a [report from Business\nKorea](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/report-android-pay-launching-with-\nlg-nexus-in-october) that claims Google will launch both Android Pay and the\nnew Nexus 5 in October 2015.\n\nThat also suggests we’ll see Google’s upcoming [Android 6.0\nMarshmallow](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/android-m-features)\noperating system launch at the same time.\n\nWe’ve also seen a number of other leaks pointing to a 2015 launch, so we’d say\nit’s almost assured that October this year will see a new Nexus device\nlanding.\n\nIt should be noted that Google is also tipped to be working on a second\nsmartphone for 2015, namely a Huawei-built Nexus 6 – the true successor to\nlast year’s Google phablet.\n\nThat device is also expected to launch at the same time as the Nexus 5. Take\nyour pick, folks.\n\n## What’s new about the LG Nexus 5?\n\nThere are some serious improvements tipped for the LG Nexus 5 (2015).\n\nThe headline feature is [Android 6.0\nMarshmallow](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/android-m-features),\nGoogle’s latest mobile operating system, set to land first on the 2015 Nexus\ndevices.\n\nWe’re also expecting to see a fingerprint scanner, a feature sorely missed on\nlast year’s Nexus 6.\n\nDon’t forget the tipped inclusion of a [USB-C\nport](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/usb-type-c-everything-you-need-\nto-know). That’s the burgeoning USB standard that will soon be appearing on a\nflurry of mobile devices over the next year.\n\nThen there’ll be a raft of spec improvements over the 2013 Nexus 5, including\nboosts to the processor, RAM, and camera. Stay tuned.\n\nIt’s also rumoured that the new LG/Google smartphone will have a shiny new\nmoniker – the [Nexus 5X](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/report-google-s-\nnew-smartphones-called-nexus-5x-and-nexus-6p).\n\nThat’s probably to make it a little easier for consumers – and tech\njournalists – to differentiate between the old LG Nexus 5.\n\n![Nexus 5 pics\n15](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)_Last year’s Nexus 6, by Motorola_\n\n## Should I wait for the LG Nexus 5?\n\nIt’s tough to say whether to wait for the LG Nexus 5. That really depends on\nwhat you want from a smartphone.\n\nThere are some serious advantages to buying a Nexus device, the most obvious\nof which is that you’ll be the first to get Google’s new operating system.\n\n[Android 6.0 Marshmallow](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/android-m-\nfeatures) will debut on the Nexus 5, so you’ll have it before everyone using\nthird-party handsets.\n\nWhat’s also important to many Android fans is that the Nexus 5 will use an\nunadulterated version of the software – no bloatware, just raw Google\ngoodness.\n\nOf course, the phone will be going up against some serious players when it\nlands, including the [Galaxy S6 Edge](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-\ngalaxy-s6-edge-review), the [LG\nG4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/lg-g4-review), and the [OnePlus\n2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/oneplus-2-review).\n\nDon’t forget that Google is tipped to be plotting a 6-inch Huawei Nexus for\n2015 too, so this could be a better choice for those who prefer their handsets\nbeefy.\n\nYou might also want to spring for the [iPhone\n6S](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-6s-release-date-rumours-news-\nspecs-and-price), which is expected to land in September, launching with iOS 9\non-board. Check out our [Android Marshmallow vs iOS 9 feature\nhere](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/android-m-vs-ios-9).\n\n**Check out our smartphone group test video below for some added\ninspiration:**\n\n**Related:[iPhone 6S release\ndate](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-6s-release-date-rumours-news-\nspecs-and-price)**\n\n## In-Depth: Nexus 5 Specs & Features Explained\n\nAs with all prospective phone launches, the features of the LG Nexus 5 (2015)\nare in serious contention.\n\nHere’s our round-up of what the Nexus 5 is likely to look like when the\nrumoured October launch window rolls around.\n\n**Nexus 5 (2015) display:**\n\nThere have been several leaks on the LG Nexus 5, which have pointed to two\npossible screen sizes.\n\nIt’s alleged that the handset has been tested as two separate variants – a\n5.2-inch model and a 5.5-inch model.\n\nMost leaks point to a 5.2-inch handset however, and we think that’s the most\nlikely form factor.\n\nAnything higher would tread too close to the rumoured 5.7-inch Huawei Nexus 6\n(2015).\n\n![Nexus 5 pics\n7](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)_The original LG-built Nexus 5 (2013)_\n\nThe general consensus among rumour-spinners is that LG is opting for a 1,920 x\n1,080 pixel P-OLED display on the new Nexus 5. That’s a respectable 423ppi\npixel density.\n\nThere’s also a chance Google and LG will opt for a 1,440 x 2,560 pixel\nresolution display. That would give the screen an eye-watering 564ppi pixel\ndensity.\n\nBut is that likely? Well Nexus devices are often based on the company’s\nflagship phones from that year.\n\nThe [LG G4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/lg-g4-review), the company’s 2015\nflagship device, uses a 2,560 x 1,440 pixel screen, which could be a major\nclue as to what sort of panel we’ll see on the next LG Nexus 5.\n\n**Related:[Android 6.0 Marshmallow\nfeatures](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/android-m-features)**\n\n**Nexus 5 (2015) design:**\n\nNexus smartphones are never very extravagant affairs, and we’re expecting the\nNexus 5X (2015) to follow that trend.\n\nThere have been a number of leaks teasing the new Nexus 5 design, but the best\nlook at the device comes courtesy of a video leak.\n\nThe clip contains a render purportedly [based on detailed factory\nschematics](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/leaked-lg-nexus-5-render-\nsuggests-fingerprint-scanner-and-usb-c) provided to smartphone accessory\nmakers.\n\nCheck it out below:\n\n(YouTube)X6AvenXqqzs(/YouTube)\n\nThe power button appears to be on the rear, in typical LG fashion.\n\nThere are also a number of features outed in the video, including a [USB-C\nport](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/usb-type-c-everything-you-need-\nto-know) and a fingerprint scanner – more on those later.\n\nOther noteworthy design points include dual front-firing speakers and a pair\nof cameras.\n\nA [separate leak of the Nexus 5X](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/new-\nnexus-5-leaks-again) appears to show similar design, although this image comes\ncourtesy of AndroidPit.\n\nAnother new design point this time around is claimed to be an ‘Ice Blue’\n[Nexus 5X colour option](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/leaked-lg-\nnexus-5x-renders-show-off-new-colour-option), as revealed by Android Police.\n\nWe’ve also seen [leaked\npackaging](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/nexus-5x-and-\nnexus-6p-packaging-leaks) for the device. Unfortunately it doesn’t give much\naway in terms of handset design, but it does corroborate the claimed ‘Nexus\n5X’ moniker.\n\n![nexus\n5x](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)_Ice Blue color option_\n\n**  \nNexus 5 (2015) camera:**\n\nWhen you’re building a smartphone in 2015, you’ve got to get the camera right.\n\nFortunately, the LG Nexus 5 is tipped to use a 13-megapixel rear-facing camera\nthat is, at least, a sign that the company isn’t skimping on raw specs.\n\nThe front-facing sensor has been rumoured to offer either 4-megapixel or\n5-megapixel image resolutions, which is similarly respectable.\n\nOf course, megapixel count isn’t everything, and we still don’t have enough\ndetails on the camera to say for sure what will feature.\n\nWe can, however, look to previous LG offerings to gauge what we might see on\nthe LG Nexus 5.\n\nThe [LG G4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/lg-g4-review), for instance,\nfeatured a high quality 16-megapixel sensor that shipped with laser autofocus,\noptical image stabilisation, and LED flash.\n\nThe LG Nexus 5 probably won’t be such a powerhouse, but we’re hoping at least\na few of those features make it to the Google-powered smartphone.\n\nOur best guess is that the G4’s laser autofocus will be bundled with the\n13-megapixel camera, and probably an LED flash too.\n\n![Nexus 5 pics\n9](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)_Claimed render, with protruding rear camera and flash_\n\n**Related:[Android Marshmallow vs iOS\n9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/android-m-vs-ios-9)**\n\n**Nexus 5 (2015) specs:**\n\nThe biggest issue of contention that surrounds the LG Nexus 5 (2015) is the\nprocessor that it will use.\n\nAnnoyingly, LG’s Nexus smartphone has been tipped with four different mobile\nchips. Ugh.\n\nThe first chip tipped to be included is the [Snapdragon\n810](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/snapdragon-810-features), which\nis Qualcomm’s current flagship offering.\n\nIt’s appeared on a number of high-end devices this year, although it’s as\ncontroversial a processor as they come.\n\nThat’s because the 810 has been plagued by complaints of overheating since the\noff, and Qualcomm has struggled to shake off that fiery reputation.\n\nIf the LG Nexus 5 is positioned as a high-end chip, the 810 is the most likely\ncandidate to appear, but it could turn off savvy consumers that have already\nheard the complaints levelled at Qualcomm over the chip.\n\nThen there’s the Snapdragon 808, a minor step-down from the 810 in terms of\nperformance.\n\nThat also means it won’t melt the back of your handset because the processor\ngot too toasty either, so that’s a plus.\n\nIt’s that sort of thinking that led LG to use the 808 in its flagship [LG\nG4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/lg-g4-review), so it wouldn’t be entirely\nimplausible for the firm to offer the chip once again with the LG Nexus 5.\n\nThe 808 has also been rumoured to be appear, courtesy of [Android Police\n‘sources’](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/new-lg-nexus-5-said-to-rock-\nsnapdragon-808-5-2-inch-1080p-display), so stay tuned on that front.\n\n![Nexus 5 pics\n11](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)_Leaked handset, or spurious fakery?_\n\nThe third chip rumoured to appear – courtesy of prolific leaker Evan Blass –\nis the Snapdragon 820.\n\nQualcomm only just officially confirmed the 820’s existence, revealing it to\nbe the forthcoming top-end chip in the US company’s line-up.\n\nUnfortunately, we’re not expecting the chip to land on devices until late 2015\nor early 2016.\n\nThat means there’s a very slim chance we’ll see the 820 on an October-\nlaunching smartphone like the Nexus 5.\n\nLastly, and actually sort of least, is the Snapdragon 620, which is one of\nQualcomm’s upper mid-range chips.\n\nIt’s the sort of component that you’d expect to see on premium mid-rangers\nlike Samsung’s Galaxy A-series, which gives you a clue as to the price point\nGoogle might position the Nexus 5 at.\n\nNeither LG nor Google has officially confirmed the chip that is set to feature\non the new Nexus 5, so we’re resigned to speculation for now.\n\nOther rumoured specs include 4GB of memory, 64GB of internal storage (that’s\npretty big, especially for a potential mid-ranger), and a battery that will\noffer a capacity of 3,500mAh, 3,180mAh, or 2,700mAh, depending on who you\nlisten to.\n\nWe should also note that a separate report, this time via\n[Androidworld.it](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/new-nexus-5-may-only-\nhave-2gb-ram), suggests the Nexus 5X will feature 2GB of RAM, not 4GB of RAM.\n\nWe’d find that very odd, particularly as most modern Android flagships ship\nwith 3GB of RAM on board.\n\n**Related:[App Permissions: The Marshmallow feature that really\nmatters](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/app-permissions-the-android-\nm-feature-that-really-matters)**\n\n**Nexus 5 (2015) software:**\n\n[Android 6.0 Marshmallow](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/android-m-\nfeatures) – that’s Google’s next big thing when it comes to mobile software.\n\nThe chewy, delicious mobile update is coming to a Nexus device near you this\nOctober, most probably, and it’ll appear first on the Nexus 5 (2015) and Nexus\n6 (2015).\n\nAs such, we already know a lot about what the software side of the new Nexus 5\nwill look like.\n\nThat’s because Google already waxed lyrical on Marshmallow back at its annual\nI/O developer conference earlier this year.\n\nOne of the biggest upgrades coming in the update is the arrival of Android\nPay, Google’s answer to Apple Pay and Samsung Pay. How very inventive…\n\n![Nexus 5 pics\n3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)_Give all your money to Google_\n\n**Related:[How Google screwed it up with\nNexus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/what-went-wrong-with-the-nexus-\nbrand)**\n\nIn fairness, Android Pay is actually a revamp of Google’s existing mobile\npayments service that’s been kicking around in the US since 2010.\n\nIt’s going to work just like Apple Pay in that you walk into a store, slap\nyour smartphone on a payment terminal, and walk out with new goods in hand and\na slightly emptier bank account.\n\nAndroid 6.0 will also be bringing Google Now on Tap, which is a context-driven\nupgrade for Android’s digital assistant.\n\nFor instance, if you’re watching a video, you can hold down the home button\nand get information about a person in the video. Similarly, if someone\nmentions a restaurant in a text, you can use it to get information about the\nrestaurant.\n\nYou’ll also be able to say “OK Google” to access Google Now from anywhere in\nthe Android OS, finally.\n\nApp permissions are getting smarter too. You won’t be forced to sign up to a\nload of developer demands when first using an app anymore. Instead, you’ll be\nasked to accept particular permission requests when you want to use a relevant\nfeature.\n\nOther features include standardised support for fingerprint scanners, battery\nlife improvements, and simplifications to some of the controls.\n\nThe one thing that won’t really change is the aesthetics of Android. Google\nmade some big changes with Android 5.0 Lollipop a la “material design”, and\nthat flat design looks set to stick around in Marshmallow too.\n\n![Nexus 5\npics](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)Android 6.0: More chewy than iOS 9, at least…\n\n**Related:[Best Smartphones 2015](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-\nsmartphone_round-up)**\n\n**Nexus 5 (2015) features:**\n\nThe response to Google’s Nexus 6 last year was tepid, to say the least.\n\nIt was lacking seriously in the ‘wow’ department, and one of the reasons for\nthat was the omission of a fingerprint scanner.\n\nThat was a big disappointment for fans of the Nexus series, as there had been\nplenty of rumours suggesting the sensor would appear.\n\nFortunately, it looks like Google has finally relented and is going to feature\na fingerprint scanner on the Nexus 5.\n\nSeveral leaks have suggested as much, including the render video leak that\nyou’ll find further up in this article.\n\nHowever, the biggest clue is that [Android 6.0\nMarshmallow](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/android-m-features) is\ngoing to standardise Android fingerprint support.\n\nGoogle made a big deal of this at I/O 2015, so it would be odd if the\nMarshmallow launch vehicles that are the Nexus 5 (2015) and Nexus 6 (2015)\ndidn’t feature the technology.\n\nIt’s also likely Google will want to utilise the security benefits of a\nfingerprint scanner when it’s trying to peddle Android Pay to Nexus users.\n\nSimilarly, we’re also expecting Google to jump on the\n[USB-C](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/usb-type-c-everything-you-\nneed-to-know) bandwagon.\n\n![Nexus 5 pics\n17](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)_USB-C, as seen on the OnePlus 2_\n\nBack at I/O, Google lauded the benefits of USB-C, and said it would be working\nhard to support the rollout of the technology.\n\nThe renders we’ve seen of the Nexus 5 also feature the burgeoning connection\nstandard, so it’s almost assured that USB-C will feature on the new Nexus\ndevices.\n\nOther, less impressive features include Wi-Fi support, an NFC chip, and\nBluetooth 4.2 connectivity.\n\n**Related:[OnePlus 2\nreview](https://www.trustedreviews.com/oneplus-2-review)**\n\n**Nexus 5 (2015) price:**\n\nThe LG Nexus 5 (2015) price is an interesting one, mainly because we’re not\nsure how Google wants to position its new smartphone.\n\nThe 2013 Nexus 5 retailed at £199 for the 16GB version, and £220 for the 32GB\nmodel.\n\nHowever, Google ditched its budget Nexus pricing last year with the £499 Nexus\n6 – many fans of the series saw that as a betrayal.\n\nAs such, it’s tough to pin down an exact price for the Nexus 5.\n\nIf the phone uses a high-end chip like the 810, it’s probably going to bear a\nsimilar price to the Nexus 6 – we’d say £350 would be the bare minimum, but it\ncould rise to £500.\n\nHowever, if LG opts for a Snapdragon 620 chip, then a mid-range price tag\nwould be more appropriate – somewhere in the region of £200 to £300.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that Google is expected to flog a Huawei-built Nexus 6\nthis year too, which will likely cost more than the Nexus 5 due to the boosted\nscreen size.\n\n**Share your thoughts on what you’d like to see from the LG Nexus 5 (2015) in\nthe comments below.**\n\n"}
