In a [blog post](https://instagram-\npress.com/blog/2018/09/24/statement-from-kevin-systrom-instagram-co-founder-\nand-ceo/) on Tuesday, Systrom says the pair will ‘take a step back’ in order\nto understand what inspires them and ‘match that with what the world needs’.\n\nNaturally, given the $1 billion sale price Instagram commanded in 2012, the\napp’s co-founders will have a much larger budget to explore and create than\nthey did a decade ago.\n\n**Related:[How to delete\nInstagram](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/delete-instagram-\naccount-2947924)**\n\nSystrom added: “We remain excited for the future of Instagram and Facebook in\nthe coming years as we transition from leaders to two users in a billion. We\nlook forward to watching what these innovative and extraordinary companies do\nnext.”\n\nHowever, today’s news comes amid suggestions of a growing rift between\nSystrom, Kreiger and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, likely over the future\ndirection of the Instagram app and associated products.\n\nCFRA analyst Scott Kessler says (via\n[Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/sep/25/instagram-\nfounders-quit-amid-suspected-clash-with-zuckerberg)): “Our sense is the duo\nmay have wanted to run Instagram more independently than their parent company\nwanted.”\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Bang & Olufsen announces Bronze Collection of multiroom speakers\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/bo-bronze-collection-3613043 \"Bang &\nOlufsen announces Bronze Collection of multiroom speakers\")\n\n  * [ ![OnePlus 6T head on](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### The OnePlus 6T might soon be available from Three\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/three-uk-oneplus-3613430 \"The OnePlus 6T\nmight soon be available from Three\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Google Home](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Google Home Black Friday Deals: What to expect and deals live now\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/google-home-black-friday-3333404\n\"Google Home Black Friday Deals: What to expect and deals live now\")\n\n  * \n\nOm Malik, of the VC firm True Ventures also told the Guardian: “I’m astonished\nthey stayed this long. The peace lasted for seven years, but in the last few\nmonths things must have started to go wrong pretty badly.”\n\nWith the co-founders riding off into the sunset to fund a new creative\ncalling, Facebook has now cleared the road to do whatever it wants with\nInstagram.\n\nFor his part, Zuckerberg said in a statement: “Kevin and Mike are\nextraordinary product leaders and Instagram reflects their combined creative\ntalents. I’ve learned a lot working with them for the past six years and have\nreally enjoyed it. I wish them all the best.”\n\nIs referring to them simply as ‘product leaders’ a parting jibe, from the\nunder-fire Facebook CEO?\n\n**Do you fear for the future of Instagram now there’s no buffer between it and\nthe Facebook machine?
