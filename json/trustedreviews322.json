Has Naughty Dog’s series had its day? Can it shine without Nathan\nDrake? Without Sully and Elena? Can a game conceived as DLC for Uncharted 4\nstand on its own two feet? In spin-off terms, are we going from Breaking Bad\nto Better Call Saul, or from Friends into the horrors of Joey?\n\nWithin its first few hours, The Lost Legacy won’t leave you in any kind of\ndoubt. While it doesn’t do anything you haven’t seen in an Uncharted game\nbefore – though you won’t have seen it done quite like this – it manages to\ncraft an enthralling adventure while transforming secondary characters into\nlikable protagonists. And while it doesn’t have the length of a full-scale\nUncharted, The Lost Legacy has the same epic spectacle and heart. Provided you\nlove Uncharted – and you really should – it’s inconceivable that you won’t\nlove this triumphant lap of honour.\n\n**Pre-order Uncharted: The Lost Legacy from[Amazon UK](http://amzn.to/2v0aOGb)\n| [Amazon.com](http://amzn.to/2usUYB6)**\n\nHere your lead is Chloe Fraser – the roguish treasure hunter introduced in\nUncharted 2 – on the trail of a Hindu relic concealed deep within India’s\nWestern Ghats. Your co-star is [Uncharted\n4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/uncharted-4) villain, Nadine Ross,\nno longer in charge of mercenary outfit, Shoreline, and joining Fraser in the\nhope of a quick buck. One of The Lost Legacy’s great successes is the way that\nit goes deep into what makes these two women tick, so that you come to\nunderstand what drives them and even empathise with Nadine – not easy if (like\nme) you spent most of Uncharted 4 wanting her dead.\n\n**Related:[PS4 Pro vs PS4  \n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ps4-pro-vs-\nps4-2941086)[![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ps4-pro-vs-\nps4-2941086)**\n\nDon’t worry about the change of cast; if you played Uncharted 4 the core\nexperience will still be very familiar. You explore exotic locales, clamber\naround crumbling ruins and solve a range of clever puzzles, while Fraser and\nRoss trade banter almost constantly. You’re not the only ones after the relic,\nthough, so you’ll also be facing off against the soldiers of a psychopathic\nIndian warlord, sometimes sneaking through the ruins and vegetation to take\nthem out one-by-one by surprise, sometimes getting stuck into some serious gun\nbattles with legions of the goons.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nBy now Naughty Dog has polished all these mechanics to a T. Take the\ntraversal. Clear but subtle markers distinguish where you can grab onto the\nscenery or climb, while Chloe has the same little telling gestures as Nathan\ndid, to let you know when you can jump to the next handhold or leap from a\nswinging rope. The third-person, cover-based combat is tight and exciting,\npushing you to use the scenery, think tactically about the situation and use\nstealth to thin down the numbers whenever you can. Sneaking up and choking\ntroops or grabbing them from below and over the precipice never gets old.\n\nMeanwhile, the first third of the game turns Uncharted 4’s flirtation with\nopen-world action into a full-blown affair, giving you a sizable area of\nrivers, ruins, mountains and mud-filled valleys to roam about in your Jeep,\nexploring its ancient temples and flooded catacombs in roughly any order that\nyou wish. There are secondary treasures to find and collect, mysteries to\nsolve and enemy squads to bring down, with caches of special weapons to unlock\nas your reward. And did we mention monkeys? Yep, this might be the most\nprimate-rich Uncharted yet.\n\n**Related:[Uncharted 5 wishlist  \n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/uncharted-5-release-date-gameplay-\nrumours-wishlist-traiiler-\nnews-2951559)[![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/uncharted-5-release-\ndate-gameplay-rumours-wishlist-traiiler-news-2951559)**\n\nIt’s within this first third that you’ll be struck by Lost Legacy’s sheer\nbeauty. You might think that you’ve seen jungles, intricately carved stonework\nand exotic vegetation before, but you haven’t seen them rendered or lit quite\nas gorgeously as this. The swirling rapids, clear pools and waterfalls are\nthings of wonder, the temple interiors growing ever more spectacular as you\nplay. The attention to detail in the characters is frequently astounding, from\nthe dirt and scratches they pick up while in action to the way water affects\ntheir clothing and their hair. Play it in\n[4K](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/4k-tv-10-reasons-why-you-should-\ncare-2908860) with [HDR](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/what-is-hdr-\ngaming-2946693) on a suitable TV, and The Lost Legacy is one of those games\nthat makes your [PS4 Pro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/ps4-pro) and\nHDR TV investment seem utterly worthwhile.\n\nIt’s a huge amount of fun, too, as you slip and slide around the often muddy\nroads and vertiginous mountain trails in your jeep, dealing with some varmints\nhere, some puzzles there, stopping every now and then to enjoy the view – it\nturns out that Chloe is a big fan of her smartphone photos. It’s not that The\nLost Legacy does anything hugely new or innovative, but it’s superbly paced\nand the puzzles are intriguing without reaching Witness levels of challenge.\nAnd where it echoes previous Uncharteds – lethal statues, jungle shootouts,\nterrifying climbs and narrow scrapes all figure large – it always finds a way\nto give them a slightly different or more spectacular spin. If Chloe’s\nsometimes covering Nathan Drake’s greatest hits, she’s doing them in her own\nstyle.\n\nThe latter two thirds of the game are a little more urgent. The action picks\nup pace and the environments grow more linear as you come closer to what you\nwant – and what you fear. The payoff comes, though, in exactly the kind of\namazing set-pieces we come to Uncharted for, including some of the series’\nbest massive-scale temple puzzles, some epic battles, dazzling action scenes\nand a chase sequence that leaves Uncharted 4’s efforts in the dust.\n\n**Related:[PS4 Pro vs Xbox One X  \n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/xbox-one-x-vs-\nps4-pro-2993235)[![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/xbox-one-x-\nvs-ps4-pro-2993235)**\n\nIf this is Naughty Dog’s last Uncharted – and it leaves its options open –\nthen The Lost Legacy is going out on a high. Over the course of a little over\n10 hours of play it had me laughing, smiling, furious, exhilarated, tense,\nthrilled, relieved and moved. In short, it gave me everything I want and\nexpect from an Uncharted game, and maybe more.\n\nI won’t be the first to say that Uncharted 4’s multiplayer modes are under-\nrated – and I’ll admit to forgetting about them often enough myself. They do a\nfantastic job of combining solid maps and inventive game modes with the slick\ncover-based combat and traversal of the single-player campaign, and if you’re\nin the mood for something with a little more swashbuckling attitude than your\naverage online FPS, you’ll have a great time.\n\nThe Lost Legacy throws in access to all existing multiplayer content, plus a\nnew Survival Arena mode, which takes the existing Horde-like co-op mode and\nturns it into a constantly transforming playlist where enemies, weapons,\nconditions and objectives switch with every wave. One wave you could be\ndefending an area from a rush of troops who drop armed grenades every time\nthey die, the next you could be tracking down marked targets who happen to be\nflaming, teleporting, bastard-hard djinn.\n\nIn a nice touch, Naughty Dog has made this new mode plus new Lost Legacy\ncharacters and skins available to players of Uncharted 4 as well. Do yourself\na favour: find some friends and get stuck in.\n\n**Related:[Best PS4 games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nps4-games) | [Upcoming PS4 Games  \n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/upcoming-\nps4-games)[![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/upcoming-\nps4-games)**\n\n**Verdict**\n\nIt might be shorter – as reflected in the price – but The Lost Legacy is a\ngreat Uncharted and a dazzling example of a studio at the top of its game. To\nbe honest, I wouldn’t have believed that Chloe and Nadine could make such\nfantastic, sympathetic protagonists or that Naughty Dog could stretch the\nformula out for another 10 hours, yet it has and I loved every minute.\n\n**Pre-order Uncharted: The Lost Legacy from[Amazon UK](http://amzn.to/2v0aOGb)\n| [Amazon.com](http://amzn.to/2usUYB6)**\n\nTo my mind, this isn’t merely one of the best games of the summer, but one of\nthe season’s best blockbusters in any media. If Naughty Dog wants to leave the\nseries here, it’s hard to grumble, but let’s hope it doesn’t. Right now, more\nUncharted seems like anything but a bad idea.\n\n## Score\n\n  \n\n"}
