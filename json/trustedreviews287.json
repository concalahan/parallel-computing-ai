There’s still no official word on the cause of the\ntechnical difficulties in Las Vegas.\n\n> Lights are back on at\n[#CES2018](https://twitter.com/hashtag/CES2018?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\nLVCC Main Hall. It'll be interesting to find out the cause but also whether\nany equipment was damaged by the outage.

I’m still in, but it’s pitch black in places.”\n\nEvan also says some manufacturers are expressing concern over the security of\ntheir products, many of which are prototypes, concepts, or new releases that\nwon’t be officially available until later this year.\n\nHe added: “Samsung kicked everyone off its stand and there are stand owners\nconcerned about their products on show. It would be very easy to pick up\nsample products without anyone noticing.”\n\nSony has also closed its stand.\n\nThe sense of confusion has also been heightened by unconfirmed reports of a\nnoise ‘like an explosion’ at the back of the LVCC, with witnesses also\nreporting fire engines on the scene.\n\nWe’re still awaiting official word on this right now, but one hopes that any\nincidents can be attributed to the electrical problems.\n\n> There is an isolated power outage at the Las Vegas Convention Center. We are\nworking hard to resolve this and appreciate your patience.\n\n>\n\n> — CES (@CES) [January 10,\n2018](https://twitter.com/CES/status/951174164244676608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nThe problems could be a result of severe rainfall in the city, which saw 1.33\ninches arrive in less than six hours – a record for January.\n\nOn Tuesday, some of the booths flooded as a result of the downpour.\n\nThe North and South Halls remain open, with show-runners advising attendees to\nvisit exhibitors while it works on solving the “isolated” problem.\n\n> While we work through this isolated power outage feel free to visit our\nexhibitors in South Hall and North Hall. Also get outside on this beautiful\nLas Vegas day and check out Central and South Plaza.\n[#CES2018](https://twitter.com/hashtag/CES2018?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n>\n\n> — CES (@CES) [January 10,\n2018](https://twitter.com/CES/status/951179147627253760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n**Have you been plunged into darkness at CES 2018?
