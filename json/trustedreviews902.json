There’s also improved ability\nto interact with messages from notifications and access to indoor positioning\ntech.\n\nHowever, the biggest update revolves around the homescreen. You can find all\nthe details in our [Android Pie: Everything you need to\nknow](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/android-p-update-\nfeatures-3410904-3410904) piece, but the short of it is that there are now\nplenty of gestures to help you navigate, plus a new section for keeping an eye\non how much you use the phone.\n\n## How to get Android Pie right now\n\nAndroid 9 Pie came out of beta on August 6th 2018, and if you have the [Google\nPixel 2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-2), [Google Pixel\nXL](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-xl) or indeed any\nother Pixel phone, you shouldn’t _need_ to do anything to get your hands on it\n– just keep an eye out for that update notification.\n\nIf you’re on tenterhooks though, keep nipping into your settings menu and\nchecking for system updates manually.\n\nThis isn’t the completely finished version of Android Pie, by the way, though\npresumably, it is stable enough for general consumption. Google is holding\nback the Digital Wellbeing features, as well as the ‘slices’ function.\n\nFor those and future updates, Google has a beta program − you can find out how\nto sign up for that further down the page − which offers early access to both\ndevelopers and the public, but it’s fair to say this version isn’t intended\nfor daily or consumer use. We’d advise that you install it on a secondary\ndevice.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nOther handsets from the beta will follow suit by the end of autumn. However,\nif you’re a highly curious tinkerer with a Pixel, Pixel XL, Pixel 2 or [Pixel\n2 XL](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-2-xl), you can\ndownload and install Android Pie today.\n\n## Android Beta Program\n\nThe easiest way to install and stay updated with the latest version of Android\nPie is to enrol in the Android Beta Program. This is currently available for\nthe range of Pixel devices, but further devices will be joining the list soon.\n\n_Here’s how to get set up:_\n\n  1. First you’ll need to follow this link – Join the [Android Beta Program](https://www.google.com/android/beta#faq) – and sign in with the Google account you run on your phone.\n  2. Scroll down and find the device you own and tap the ‘Opt-in’ button.\n  3. Give it a few minutes and a prompt should appear in the notification panel. Tap this and it will begin to download and install.\n\nThere are other devices that support the beta too, including the [OnePlus\n6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/oneplus-6) and [Sony Xperia\nXZ2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sony-xperia-xz2). Each of these\nrequire a slightly different approach to the installation.\n\n## How to downgrade from Android Pie to Android Oreo\n\nOnce you’ve installed Android P on your device, it is possible to roll\neverything back if you’re not finding the software stable enough. Although\nsimple, you’ll have to completely wipe the device – so remember to back up.\n\n  1. From the [Android Beta Portal](https://www.google.com/android/beta#faq) page, there should now be an ‘Opt-out’ option that has replaced the ‘Opt-in’\n  2. Click this and another OTA download should appear, rolling you back to the latest version of Android Oreo.\n\n**What are you hoping for in Android P?
