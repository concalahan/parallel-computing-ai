However,here there’s a sense that it’s not just our hero, the Deputy, who’s escapingEden Gate’s cult maniacs, but the series trying to escape its limitations. FarCry 5 is running both from the ghosts of Far Crys past and the even moreterrifying spectre of the ‘Ubigame’ – that cynical internet theory that allUbisoft games are essentially the same.It’s a theory that won a lot of supporters after Ubisoft released an endlessstream of near-identical open-world games that followed the same tired format:climb towers, take over territories, repeat.**Buy Far Cry 5from[Tesco.com]()## VerdictDoes Far Cry 5 escape the Ubigame shadow? At its best, it does tear itselffree, with some systems stripped away and others streamlined, plus a greatersense of immersion and discovery than the series has had in years. The Seedsmake great Far Cry villains, disrupting the flow when it threatens to growdull, and there’s something familiar and unsettling about the Montana settingthat brings the whole game to life.Yet there’s still a sense that Far Cry needs to push things further, with toomany mundane and repetitive tasks littering its map screen, and that morevariety is needed in its core mission design. This is a phenomenal open-worldshooter and an excellent Far Cry. With a little extra push, it could have beeneven more.## Score"}
