Instead it will license out the\nRoku Connect software and hardware reference points to third-party companies\nto allow them to build devices that work with the entertainment platform and\nvirtual assistant.\n\nRoku already offers voice searching with its TV streaming devices, but with a\nvirtual assistant it wants to build upon that, allowing users to, for example,\nrequest that a certain type of music is played in a specific room in the house\nall through a voice command.\n\nWhile the likes of Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri, and the Google Assistant\noffer such smart capabilities though the [Amazon Echo\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/amazon-echo)and [Google Home\nMini](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-home-mini) respectively,\nRoku won’t butt heads with the tech giants as it plans to keep its virtual\nassistant entertainment-focused.\n\nThat means the Roku Entertainment Assistant won’t be able to order pizzas and\ntaxis from simple voice commands, but it could instead offer a more\ncomprehensive smart home entertainment service.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nGiven Roku has pretty much gone as far as it currently can with its streaming\ndevices buy supporting 4K and HDR, it makes sense for the company to try and\nmake inroads into the smart home audio world, particularly as many of the\nservices currently on offer tend to be proprietary systems that don’t play\nnice with gadgets and devices from other manufacturers.\n\nAccording to Roku more will be revealed at CES so keep tuned in to _Trusted\nReviews_ for more.\n\n**Related:[Best streaming services for\n2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-streaming-sites)**\n\n**Does the idea of interconnected entertainment devices appeal to you, or does\nit risk complicating finely-tuned setups?
