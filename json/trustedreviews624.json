High\ndemand from early adopter types married to a limited supply from Apple itself\nmade for quite the exclusive device.\n\nHowever, three months on and a new market research report claims that Apple’s\nsmartwatch is underperforming in its home market.\n\nAccording to Slice Intelligence, Apple Watch sales in the US have dropped a\nstaggering 90 per cent since the opening week. As reported by\n[MarketWatch](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-watch-may-not-be-ticking-\nwith-customers-2015-07-07), following an initial April launch-week surge that\nsaw the Apple Watch selling at around 200,000 units a day, the number has\nfallen to fewer than 20,000 watches a day.\n\nOn some days that figure has dropped even lower, to fewer than 10,000 a day.\n\nAnother troublesome statistic is that two-thirds of the watches sold so far\nhave been of the cheapest model, the Apple Watch Sport.\n\nIt’s worth noting Slice Intelligence’s methodology here. It compiles its\nfigures by scanning electronic receipts from a sample of customers who opted\nin to having their inboxes tracked in such a way.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nWe should also emphasise that these projected figures are for the US only –\nthey don’t represent the performance of the Apple Watch in the other\nterritories in which it’s available, such as the UK.\n\n**Read More:[Apple Watch vs Android\nWear](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/apple-watch-vs-android-wear)**\n\nApple itself hasn’t been forthcoming with information regarding sales\nperformance of the Apple Watch in these early months, which is why such\nmethods have been of interest to investors.\n\nCheck out our video asking whether the Apple Watch really is the future of\nwearables below.\n\n"}
