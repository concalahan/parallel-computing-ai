According to its calculations, everything suggests that Sony is\naiming for a summer release for its next big phone.\n\nThe first hint that Sony’s typical MWC launch plans perhaps weren’t set to be\nrepeated this year came [back in\nDecember](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/sony-xperia-z4-images-leaked-by-\nsony-hack), when an interesting piece of information emerged from the\ncatastrophic Sony hack.\n\nSony’s product pitch for the upcoming Bond movie was among the details\nspilled, and in that pitch was the claim that the “Xperia Z Fourth Generation”\nwould launch in May or November of 2015.\n\nThe report also points to the fact that we haven’t seen any leaks of the Z4\nitself. With MWC almost a month a way, it’s pretty hard to believe that Sony\nhas tightened things up that effectively.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n**Read More:[MWC 2015: What to\nexpect](https://www.trustedreviews.com/hubs/mwc-2015)**\n\nWith Sony [recently announcing](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/purple-\nsony-xperia-z3-announced-as-carphone-warehouse-exclusive) a purple [Sony\nXperia Z3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/sony-xperia-z3-review), it’s quite\npossible that the company will stick with its current flagship for a few more\nmonths, and use MWC 2015 to launch a mid-range handset instead.\n\nOf course, it’s not like Sony has been slack with its mobile efforts in recent\ntimes. From the original [Sony Xperia Z](https://www.trustedreviews.com/sony-\nxperia-z-review) through to the current Sony Xperia Z3 (pictured), the company\nhas kept up an exhausting six month refresh cycle on its flagship phone range.\n\nIs that about to be broken?\n\n"}
