In my first\nfew hours with Call of Duty Black Ops 4, the most consistently noticeable\naspect was how slick everything felt, exuding quality all over the place like\na big ol’ quality hose.\n\nYou don’t need to explain Call of Duty’s concept. For the last decade, the\ngame has seeped into the public consciousness, becoming synonymous with gaming\nin a way most brands would only dream of. Chances are, even if you’ve never\nplayed it you have a decent concept of how Call of Duty’s multiplayer looks,\nthe UI absorbed through a bizarre form of photosynthesis, such has been the\nfranchise’s exposure.\n\nSo, Call of Duty has rolled around again, all full of jingoism and a gung-ho\nattitude. However, this year it has cut the single-player campaign in favour\nof fleshing out its three distinct multiplayer segments, each of which\ncomfortably contains enough content to fill its own full-price release.\n\nThe game has a competitive PvP mode, generally referred to as Multiplayer in\nthe game, a cooperative Zombies mode and a well-polished battle royale mode\nentitled Blackout.\n\n**Check out our Black Ops 4 Guides Coverage:[Blood of the Dead – Tips and\nTricks](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/black-ops-4-zombies-blood-of-the-\ndead-tips-and-tricks-guide-3605867) | [Top 6 Blackout\nTips](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-4-blackout-\nguide-tips-3606083)**\n\n![Call of Duty Black Ops\n4](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nAcross the board, there’s fluid gunplay, tight movement and a weird\npredilection for gore. It’s not just the case that a player could walk over a\nhidden mine and blow their legs off – although that does happen – but that\nthere are lashings of blood and body parts everywhere you look.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThe introduction to the story, which is weaved through the multiplayer mode,\nopens with a machine gun blowing off a soldier’s arms, while another catches a\nbullet to the head, tearing open her face, which hangs open lazily as she\ntries to talk in the next scene.\n\nFor a game that does its best to sanitise military-grade murder, it’s a\nsurprisingly brutal opening scene, and from there it doesn’t let up. Call in a\nhellfire missile, one of the several killstreak rewards on offer, and you’ll\nbe greeted with a score pop-up rewarding you for your frags, in addition to a\npile of bloody gibs. This isn’t to say it’s a bad thing, but it did make me\nsquirm a few times.\n\nThe multiplayer feels drastically different after just a few matches,\nrevealing a more tactical game with a focus on playing as different\n‘specialists’ that can affect the game in different ways. Initially, I was\ndrawn to Crash, a combat medic who can buff his allies’ health or drop ammo\npacks to keep the team tooled up. Crucial now that ammo is limited and there’s\nno more regenerating health.\n\n**Related:[Best PC Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-pc-\ngames-3520096)**\n\n![Call of Duty Black Ops\nreview](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThese specialists aren’t classes, and their unique abilities aren’t\nkillstreaks – both of those exist in the game in addition to the specialist\nsystem, and in fact, the specialist abilities are closer in tone to equipment.\n\nThere aren’t a lot of grenades in Black Ops 4, as many players will opt for\nthe unique specialist equipment, but there are still plenty of ways to get\nyourself killed, as specialists have access to tools like trip-mines, grenade\nlaunchers, ballistic shields, and even an adorable attack dog. Loveable right\nuntil he goes for the throat. It’s clear that the influence of shooters like\n[Overwatch](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/overwatch) and [Rainbow Six\nSiege](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/rainbow-six-siege) has been felt\nhere, but it’s still distinctly a Call of Duty experience.\n\nThe specialist you choose informs the way you’ll play. Crash is a supporting\ncharacter that hands out ammo, heals and buffs his teammates. He’s there to\nkeep you pushing forward and hints at a more team-focused Call of Duty.\n\nYet in many of the multiplayer playlists, this just isn’t the case as\npreternaturally talented Call of Duty players take on all comers, single-\nhandedly charging around levels and carving out an advantage that can be used\nto snowball to victory.\n\nThe regular playlists can, as a result, feel like a hostile atmosphere as you\ntry to cling on to any success, as a small loss can quickly lead to death by a\nthousand killstreak rewards as the enemy hammers you with missiles, attack\nhelicopters and a bunch of other things that go bang.\n\n**Related:[Nvidia RTX 2080 Ti\nReview](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nvidia-rtx-2080-ti)**\n\n![Call of Duty Black Ops 4\n](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nThis is often the case even despite the game’s incredible tutorial system,\nwhich takes you through an operator’s strengths and weaknesses while also\nfeeding you their story in a series of cutscenes. Some of these tell the\noverarching meta-narrative of the game, while some just give you a look at the\npersonality of the operator you’re playing.\n\nHowever, there are still highlights and the multiplayer PvP gameplay is at its\nbest when it slows the pace down, keeping the frenetic action but introducing\nconsequences to stop it being such a meat grinder, as the game is mechanically\nelegant enough to lose its lustre slightly when it becomes a live, die,\nrespawn cycle. There are hints of this in the limited lives of Control mode,\nor the one-and-done round-based gunplay of Search and Destroy.\n\nThe Heist gamemode, a new addition to the series, offers round-based\nmultiplayer shooting that puts you into a buy menu at the start of each round,\nall the better to blow the earnings you accumulated from killing enemies. So\nfar so Counter-Strike, and the comparison doesn’t get any more flattering with\nthe addition of the fact that each death is final, leaving you to wait until\nthe next round.\n\nThere are differences, though. The end goal here is to either extract the bag\nof cash set in the middle of each map, or to kill every member of the enemy\nteam, but the items you can buy and the strategies you can engage in mark it\nout as separate to the games that it’s inspired by, and worthy of considering\nas its own unique gametype.\n\n**Related:[Best Xbox One Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/xbox-one-\ngames-3435271)**\n\n![Call of Duty Black Ops 4\nreview](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSo far, it’s my favourite part of the multiplayer in a big way, forcing\nplayers to pick between different upgrade trees and strategies to react to the\nplays of the enemy team. Notable rounds included several matches where I\nrefused to wield anything but a combat knife and some body armour, flanking\nand roaming with the aim of getting stabby with any enemies that weren’t\npaying enough attention, but also when we discovered that the fully upgraded\nrevolver would kill anyone unfortunate enough to catch a headshot from the\nfast-firing sidearm.\n\nFor those that can hack the intense pressure of playing Call of Duty online,\nit’s as good here as it’s ever been, and the constant dripfeed of challenges,\nunlocks and customisation is a heady cocktail that will intoxicate not just\nthe buy-it-every-year-even-Ghosts diehards, but also those who are on the\nfence about what a completely multiplayer Call of Duty can even offer.\n\nZombies is a labyrinthine affair and nearly beyond the limits of human\nunderstanding, but for groups that can find someone that understands the\ninterlocking systems or, perhaps, read a wiki during play, this is one of the\nfinest cooperative shooters out there. You can also play with bots who prove\nthemselves as surprisingly intelligent allies.\n\nThere’s deep lore, killer production values and the mode manages to capture\nthe shooting that has always made Call of Duty feel satisfying, even if most\nmatches end when all of the players are swamped with slow-moving, heavy\nhitting, undead monsters.\n\nBefore that happens, you could find yourself ringing gongs, cutting ropes to\nbe given challenges and even feeding all of your weaponry into an\ninterdimensional portal that will ugprade your guns and give you a chance\nagainst the undead tide. These actions are all in the first level of the\nZombie mode, yet each of the three packaged with the game has their own\nquirks, story and characters.\n\n**Related:[Best PS4 Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nps4-games-3431751)**\n\n![Call of Duty Black Ops\n4](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nRegardless, those hoping that the different time periods might feature\ndifferent weapon sets or gunplay may be disappointed: you’re just as likely to\ncowboy up and go to war with a laser-spewing sub-machine gun in Ancient Rome\nas you are on a zombie-infested boat. It’s a disappointing change, but one\nthat makes a lot more sense when you consider that fetishing military hardware\nis a franchise hallmark.\n\nFinally, we touch on Blackout. The game’s battle royale mode has been watched\nwith keen eyes since it was first announced, and it is one of the first true\nAAA experiences in the space. In areas it’s a little clunky – some of the\nanimations feel a bit rigid in the wide-open battleground, but generally, it\nfeels like one of the most polished experiences in the genre that I’ve played.\n\nI’d go so far as to say that it’s my favourite battle royale currently\navailable. The huge map is stitched together from chunks of beloved franchise\nlocations, meaning you can land in Nuketown or even a hydroelectric dam and\nexplore refined versions of popular maps, which means every single element\nfeels refined. Wherever you’re fighting, it often feels like the environment\nhas ways for you to flank or reposition.\n\nThere are some weird parts that don’t quite mesh with the rest of the\nexperience: some of the gadgets feel underutilised, a poor fit for the\nplaystyle. However, the addition of zombies to protect certain areas, and the\ninclusion of perks as limited-time consumables, are bold new choices for the\nbattle royale genre while still feeling familiar.\n\nWhile across the board the game is graphically a little underwhelming, it\nperformed well enough on my PC, and you’re often moving so quickly that you\ndon’t notice. The design leaves a little to be desired outside of the weaponry\nin the game, which includes some tremendous faux weapons.\n\n## Verdict\n\nCall of Duty Black Ops 4 is a bold reinvention of a series that desperately\nneeded it. Despite the success of Call of Duty WWII, it felt like the mega-\nfranchise had lost its way.\n\nIt plays to its strengths and delivers enough multiplayer content to make it\nworth recommending. It’s a strong entry, with fluid shooting. I wouldn’t buy\nthe PR line that this is ‘three different games’ but all three branches play\ninto each other, enhancing the overall package. Fans of Call of Duty will have\na ball, although those that have never understood the appeal won’t be won over\nhere.\n\nStill, it’s probably one of the best multiplayer shooters released this year,\nand the AAA implementation of a battle royale is a fascinating thing to play,\ntoo.\n\n## Call of Duty Black Ops 4 PC requirements\n\nWant to splash out on a brand new rig to celebrate the release of Call of Duty\nBlack Ops 4? We’ve had a look at the official recommended specs and rounded up\nall of the components to build a gaming PC suited to the popular shooter.\n\nThe recommended specs are listed below:\n\n  * **OS:** Windows 10 64-bit\n  * **CPU:** Intel Core i5-2500K or AMD Ryzen R5 1600X processor\n  * **RAM:** 12GB RAM\n  * **HDD:** 80GB HD space\n  * **GPU:** NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 4 GB / GTX 1060 6 GB or Radeon R9 390 / AMD RX 580\n\nBut as you’ll see in our ‘recommended build’ table, we’ve suggested slightly\nmore expensive options for some of the components, just to ensure you get a\nfantastic performance and buttery smooth frame rates.\n\nWe’ve also created two separate builds: one for HD gaming and the latter for\n4K. Mind, the second option is significantly more expensive, but if you really\nwant to make the most out of your Ultra HD monitor, then you’ve got cough up\nthe cash. Anything less than a 1080 Ti would likely see a big dip in\nperformance.\n\n| **Recommended HD build** | **Recommended 4K build**  \n---|---|---  \n**CPU** |  [ AMD Ryzen 3 2200G CPU](https://amzn.to/2RNxXEg) (£90) |  [Intel\nCore i7-8700K](https://amzn.to/2Opbz5K) (£242)  \n**Motherboard** |  [ GIGABYTE B450M](https://amzn.to/2A8qCbn) (£69) |  [MSI\nZ370 Gaming Pro](https://amzn.to/2OnXMwA) (£173)  \n**RAM** |  [ Corsair Vengeance lpx 16gb](https://amzn.to/2Orhasn) (£137) |\n[Corsair Vengeance lpx 16gb](https://amzn.to/2RO9oai) (£137)  \n**SSD** |  [ Kingston UV500\n120GB](https://www.overclockers.co.uk/kingston-120gb-ssdnow-\nuv500-sata-6gb-s-2.5-7mm-height-solid-state-drive-\nhd-10e-ks.html?campaign=affiliate%2Ftag) (£35) |  [Samsung 970 Evo\n500GB](https://amzn.to/2RO9G0S) (£135)  \n**HDD** |  NA |  [WD Blue 1TB HDD](https://amzn.to/2yClAlH) (£37)  \n**GPU** |  [ Nvidia GTX 1060](https://amzn.to/2OkFSuu) (£200) |  [Gigabyte\nAORUS NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti](https://amzn.to/2A9J7fA) (£686)  \n**Power supply** |  [ Corsair TX650M 80 Plus Gold](https://amzn.to/2yzxigT)\n(£75) |  [Corsair TX650M 80 Plus Gold](https://amzn.to/2CHmhhQ) (£75)  \n**Case** |  [ BitFenix Nova](https://amzn.to/2OpMXKg) (£34) |  [NZXT\nS340](https://amzn.to/2ISUQlz) (£65)  \n**Cooler** |  NA |  [Be Quiet!

Sure, they’re both overkill for Call of Duty Black Ops 4, but\nthese components would keep your rig future-proofed for years to come.\n\n## Score\n\n  \n\n"}
