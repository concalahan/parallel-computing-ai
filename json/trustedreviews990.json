With that in\nmind, we’d recommend holding off picking up the V30 until the firm’s next-gen\nflagship is available. Why, you ask? Because the G7 could bring a number of\nneat new features to the table that tickle your fancy – and, as we all know,\nthere are few feelings worse than regret._\n\n## **What is the LG V30?**\n\nThe V30 is LG’s latest flagship device and it offers a whole load of features\nthat wouldn’t find anywhere else.\n\nIt’s a great phone, but one that appears to have lost some of its lustre as a\nresult of the delayed release. Currently on the market are the [Huawei Mate 10\nPro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/huawei-mate-10-pro), [Pixel 2\nXL](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-2-xl) and [iPhone\nX](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-x), all of which are muscling\nin on the V30’s territory.\n\n## **LG V30 – Design**\n\nThe V30 is the best designed LG phone I’ve ever used. It’s the perfect mix of\nhigh-end metal and glass, sporting curves in all the right places. It spells\nthe end in LG’s transformation from making unattractive devices – the leather\nLG G4, anyone? – to ones that are gimmick-free.\n\n**[Order LG V30 from Carphone Warehouse for\n£799](https://www.carphonewarehouse.com/home/products/lg/v30.html#!colour=silver&capacity=64GB&dealType=sf)**\n\nLike all the best flagships in 2017, the V30 slims down the bezel surrounding\nthe display and pushes that screen out as far as possible. The corners of the\nscreen are rounded, but the display doesn’t curve in the way of the [Samsung\nGalaxy S8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s8). This\nmeans the device is a tad wider, but still surprisingly manageable to grip\nconsidering the 6-inch screen.\n\n**Related:[Best smartphones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nsmartphone)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n###  Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe LG V30 feels great in the hand, but unnervingly light. I’m sure that there\nwill be many that like this, but I’m not so sure; I like my phones to have a\nlittle heft. Tap the rear of the V30 and it feels hollow, something you don’t\nget with an [iPhone 8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-8) or\nNote 8.\n\nHowever, in terms of the LG V30’s design, this is really the only negative in\nmy opinion. Elsewhere, it’s IP67-rated for water-resistance; it retains the\nheadphone jack; and its fingerprint scanner sits in the right place – below\nthe cameras on the back. That scanner also doubles as the lock button – and\nit’s one of the fastest I’ve tried.\n\n## **LG V30 – Screen**\n\nThis is the first LG flagship to swap an LCD panel for an OLED one since the\ndays of those weird Flex phones. LG makes some of the best OLED panels for\nTVs, so you’d assume its smaller versions would be equally as good.\n\nAnnoyingly, they’re not. The screen isn’t terrible, but it’s comfortably the\nweakest part of the phone.\n\nDetail isn’t the issue: the quad-HD resolution ensures pixels are impossible\nto spot. However, colours often come across slightly off. Whites are muddy,\nand it’s virtually impossible to watch HDR/Dolby Vision content on Netflix\nbecause it’s far too dark.\n\nViewing angles, too, are poor – tilt the device to the side and you’ll be met\nwith a blue tinge.\n\n**Related:[Best Android\nsmartphones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-android-phones-1)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nUse the LG V30 and you’ll quickly realise that we’ve been spoiled by the Super\nAMOLEDs in Samsung devices. LG’s OLEDs, called POLED (that P is for plastic),\njust aren’t as good. It’s the same panel type that let the [Pixel 2\nXL](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-2-xl) down. People\noften conclude that OLED is always better than an LCD, but viewing the V30’s\ndisplay, I’d have been happier with the iPhone 8 Plus’ screen – which is LED.\n\nFollowing the blueprint set by the [Samsung Galaxy\nS8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s8) and [iPhone\nX](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-x), the V30 stretches the\ndisplay out to the corners, reducing the distracting bezel. As a result, the\nV30 has an 18:9 aspect-ratio as opposed to the typical 16:9.\n\nThe panel is taller, which means it’s great for reading and multitasking, but\nless so for video. In YouTube, for example, there will be chunky black bars\nsitting either side of the video.\n\n[ Next  \nSoftware and Performance\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/lg-v30-software-and-performance)\n\n"}
