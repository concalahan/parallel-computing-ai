Here’s some of our favourite picks\n\n2018 has been chock full of outstanding smartphones and the year’s not even\nover yet. There are a wealth of classically-styled flagships like the [Samsung\nGalaxy S9](https://amzn.to/2uTIpT8), [Google Pixel\n3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-3), [iPhone\nXS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xs) and [Huawei P20\nPro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/huawei-p20-pro), as well as more\nsubversive options like the [Pocophone\nF1](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/xiaomi-pocophone-f1) and the new\n[OnePlus 6T](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/oneplus-6t). Here we take\nsome of the guesswork out of deciding which phone is best for you.\n\nKeep your eyes peeled on this rundown as we’re also currently looking forward\nto testing the recently announced [Huawei Mate 20\nPro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/huawei-mate-20-pro), as well as\ninteresting new entrants from Xiaomi, Oppo and more.\n\nIf you’re looking for something that’s a bit lighter on the wallet then take a\nlook at our [best cheap phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\ncheap-mobile-phones-3430364) round-up, or if you’ve got a bit more to spend\nhave a look at these [best mid-range\nsmartphones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-mid-range-\nsmartphones-3607758).\n\n**How we select the best smartphones**\n\n### best overall smartphone\n\n[](https://amzn.to/2CVt47M)\n\n###\n\n[ Huawei P20 Pro UK SIM-Free Smartphone - Black\n\n](https://amzn.to/2CVt47M)\n\nThe P20 Pro is a marvel of smartphone design with a game changing camera setup\nand a whopping 128GB storage space as standard.\n\nNow £759.99\n\n[View deal\n\n](https://amzn.to/2CVt47M)\n\nEvery handset we review is tested using the same combination of real-world use\ncases and repeatable benchmark tests. This means that we test everything from\nbattery life and processor performance during the full range of everyday\ntasks, right up to call quality and screen calibration. Most of all, we take\nthese phones out and use them as our own over an extended period, living with\nthem to learn their quirks and discover any hidden treasures.\n\nSo now you know how we select the best smartphones, let’s take a look at our\nhighlights.\n\n**Related:[Best SIM only ](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-sim-only-\ndeals-uk-2943877)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n## iPhone XR: Best for iPhone XS features on a budget\n\n![iPhone\nXR](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Pros:**\n\n  * Wide range of colours\n  * XS features at a lower price\n  * Great camera\n  * Top performance\n\n**Cons:**\n\n  * No fast charger included\n\nFor us, the [iPhone XR](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xr) is\nthe best iPhone Apple has released in 2018. It offers the same fantastic\n12-megapixel f/1.8 wide-angle camera with Smart HDR and A12 Bionic as the XS\nbut at a price that’s a bit easier to stomach. At £750/$750, the iPhone XR is\n£250/$250 cheaper than the entry-level iPhone XS.\n\nOther highlights here include impressive battery life, wireless charging, a\nnice range of colours and classic Apple build quality. Before release lots was\nsaid about the 6.1-inch Liquid Retina display and while it’s not as good as\nthe XS, it still has bright colours and looks good to our eyes.\n\nOur one main criticism, as is usual with Apple’s phones, is the lack of an\nincluded fast charger. Instead you’ll have to spend about three hours charging\nthe iPhone XR up from the 5w plug or pay more for a faster one.\n\n  * **Read our[iPhone XR review](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xr)**\n\n## Google Pixel 3: Best for Android\n\n![Pixel 3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Pros:**\n\n  * Great haptics\n  * Google’s Android is the best Android\n  * Much-improved design\n  * Breathtaking camera both on the front and back\n  * Fast wireless charging and clever Pixel Stand (even if it’s not included)\n\n**Cons:**\n\n  * No form of facial unlocking\n  * Can scratch easily\n\nGoogle’s newest Pixels improve upon their predecessors in a myriad of ways,\nalthough some of their best features are more down to the machine learning\nprowess of Google, more so than the hardware that’s inside these handsets.\n\nThe 5.5-inch [Pixel 3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-3)\nis our preferred option, not least because it forgoes what is arguably the\nlargest notch on any smartphone, without losing out on any of the [Google\nPixel 3 XL](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-3-xl)‘s\nfunctionality. It’s powered by the same Snapdragon 845 found in most of the\ndevices in this current ‘best of’ list and comes backed up by a comparatively\nconservative 4GB of RAM.\n\nThe new glass-backed design sets it apart from its predecessor and allows for\nwireless charging while the OLED display on the front is great for watching\nHDR content. Camera technology is the biggest talking point of any Pixel phone\nand it looks as though Google has done it again. The company has added an\ninsanely capable low-light shooting mode call Night Sight, Super Res Zoom\nhelps ease the lack of a secondary rear sensor and the additional super-wide\nfront-facing camera means you can squeeze more of your friends in-shot when\nit’s selfie time.\n\n  * **Read our[Google Pixel 3 XL review](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-3-xl)**\n  * **Read our[Google Pixel 3 review](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-3)**\n\n## OnePlus 6T: Best for value and performance\n\n![OnePlus 6T rear 3/4\nview](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Pros:**\n\n  * New fingerprint sensor feels cutting-edge\n  * Up-to-date, versatile OS\n  * Fast Charge is still great\n  * Great battery life\n\n**Cons:**\n\n  * Camera’s Nightscape mode needs work\n  * Another headphone jack bites the dust\n  * Fingerprint sensor needs refinement\n  * Poor audio capabilities\n\nHalf the price of an [iPhone\nXS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xs) but with just as much\nclout. Boasting an expansive 6.41-inch AMOLED screen with an in-display\nfingerprint sensor, a Snapdragon 845 processor backed up by up to 8GB of RAM\nand a whopping 3700mAh battery, the new [OnePlus\n6T](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/oneplus-6t) is not to be sniffed\nat.\n\nStarting at £499, it offers better value for money than its predecessor, the\n[OnePlus 6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/oneplus-6) (as it starts\nwith twice the base internal storage at 128GB) and OnePlus has worked to\nimprove the already-excellent [Android\n9.0](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/android-pie)-powered OxygenOS\nsoftware experience on top, along with the HDR and low light credentials of\nthe phone’s dual 16/20-megapixel sensor.\n\n## Samsung Galaxy Note 9: Best for size\n\n![Samsung Galaxy Note\n9](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\n**Pros:**\n\n  * Fantastic screen\n  * Big battery\n  * The S Pen\n\n**Cons:**\n\n  * Bixby button is an annoyance\n  * The S9 Plus feels better\n\nSamsung’s Note series has long been the ‘Best Big Phone’ and that continues\nwith the excellent [Samsung Galaxy Note\n9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-9). There might\nonly be a handful of tweaks over the Note 8, but they’re all important.\n\nThe biggest update is the battery. Gone is the 3400mAh cell, replaced by a\nlarger 4000mAh version and it makes a real difference. The endurance here is\nmuch better, comfortably lasting a day even if you’re a heavy user.\n\nThere’s also more storage as standard (128GB rather than 64GB) plus a 512GB\nmodel too. The microSD card is still here, as is an IP68 rating, wireless\ncharging and the S Pen.\n\nThe S Pen remains a handy tool for taking notes and with the Note 9, it’s\navailable in a variety of colours. The lovely Ocean Blue device, for example,\ncomes with a nice yellow pen. Bluetooth is now included on the stylus and this\nlets you use it as a remote for a camera or for skipping songs.\n\nInside the Note, there’s a very similar setup to the [Samsung Galaxy S9\nPlus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9-plus). The\nExynos 9810 (Snapdragon 845 in the States) is paired with 6GB or 8GB RAM.\nThere’s also a dual-aperture 12-megapixel camera on the back that’ll switch\nbetween f/1.5 and f/2.4 depending on the environment. The camera takes some\nvery good shots, but it can’t quite match the quality produced by the Pixel 2\nor HTC U12 Plus.\n\n  * **Read our[Galaxy Note 9 review](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-9)**\n\n## iPhone XS & iPhone XS Max: Best for performance\n\n![iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max on\ntable](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \n**Pros**\n\n  * Amazing displays\n  * Exceptional performance\n  * Face ID remains the best at facial recognition\n\n**Cons**\n\n  * Expensive\n  * iOS doesn’t make the most of the Max’s bigger display\n  * Fast charger not included\n\nApple’s newest flagship phones, the [iPhone\nXS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xs) and [iPhone XS\nMax](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xs-max) bring a selection\nof high-end specs to the table. We’ve paired both handsets together as they’re\nmore like each other than any previous generation of iPhone and whichever one\nyou choose, you’re getting a great iPhone experience.\n\nBoth sport beautiful HDR10 and Dolby Vision-compliant OLED Super Retina\ndisplays, both rock Apple’s newest and most powerful chipset yet, the A12\nBionic, both offer 4GB RAM and up to 512GB of storage, both support dual SIM –\na first for any iPhone, as well as IP68 dust and water resistance. There’s\nalso the company’s signature TrueDepth sensor for both fast Face ID unlocking\nand Animoji, not to mention there’s a superb dual 12-megapixel camera with\ndual OIS onboard.\n\nThe iPhone XS is for those who want the latest and greatest iPhone hardware\nwithin the same form factor as last year’s [iPhone\nX](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-x), while the larger iPhone\nXS Max swaps out a 5.8-inch display for a huge 6.5-inch panel that’s ideal for\nenjoying media and gaming on the go.\n\n  * **Read our[iPhone XS review](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xs)**\n  * **Read our[iPhone XS Max review](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xs-max)**\n\n##\n\n## Samsung Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9 Plus: Safe options\n\n![Samsung Galaxy\nS9](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Pros:**\n\n  * Fantastic screen\n  * Feels great\n  * Improved speakers\n\n**Cons:**\n\n  * Average battery life\n  * Dual-sensor only on Plus model\n  * Some lag with Samsung’s software\n\nYou can’t go wrong with either the [Samsung Galaxy\nS9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9) or [Samsung\nGalaxy S9 Plus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-\ngalaxy-s9-plus), though if we had to recommend one we’d go with the latter –\nand that’s because it comes with a dual-camera. The extra lens, in this\ninstance, is used for zooming without losing quality, making the camera far\nmore versatile.\n\nBoth the Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9 Plus sport an identical build (size\ndifference notwithstanding) and similar internals, with the main differences\nbeing that the Plus model is equipped with an additional 2GB of RAM, a\nslightly bigger battery and the aforementioned dual-camera configuration –\nluxuries most customers should be able to live without.\n\nThe biggest update Samsung treated the Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9 Plus to is a\nnew variable aperture setting within the camera, letting customers switch\nbetween an f/2.4 and f/1.5 aperture whenever they see fit, which should ensure\nimages come out bright and full of detail in almost all low-light\nenvironments.\n\n  * **Read our[Galaxy S9 review](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9)**\n  * **Read our[Galaxy S9 Plus review](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9-plus)**\n\n### The Top Samsung Galaxy S9 Deals Right Now\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=422&clickref=TR-\nGalaxyS9&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.e2save.com%2Fcontract%2Fsamsung%2Fsamsung-\ngalaxy-s9-black%3Ftariffcode%3DDD1YEFEB18%26giftcode%3DNA16)\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=422&clickref=TR-\nGalaxyS9&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.e2save.com%2Fcontract%2Fsamsung%2Fsamsung-\ngalaxy-s9-black%3Ftariffcode%3DDD1YEFEB18%26giftcode%3DNA16)\n\n###\n\n[ Samsung Galaxy S9 – 4GB, £23pm, £100 upfront from Vodafone (use code EPICTEN\nto save £10)\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=422&clickref=TR-\nGalaxyS9&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.e2save.com%2Fcontract%2Fsamsung%2Fsamsung-\ngalaxy-s9-black%3Ftariffcode%3DDD1YEFEB18%26giftcode%3DNA16)\n\ne2save has come out with this brilliantly affordable contract for the Galaxy\nS9, made even better with a £10 discount when using the code EPICTEN.\n\n[e2save\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=422&clickref=TR-\nGalaxyS9&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.e2save.com%2Fcontract%2Fsamsung%2Fsamsung-\ngalaxy-s9-black%3Ftariffcode%3DDD1YEFEB18%26giftcode%3DNA16)\n\n|\n\n£110 upfront w/code\n\n|\n\nNow £23pm\n\n[View\nDeal](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=422&clickref=TR-\nGalaxyS9&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.e2save.com%2Fcontract%2Fsamsung%2Fsamsung-\ngalaxy-s9-black%3Ftariffcode%3DDD1YEFEB18%26giftcode%3DNA16)\n\nNow £23pm\n\n|\n\n£110 upfront w/code\n\n|\n\n[e2save\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=422&clickref=TR-\nGalaxyS9&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.e2save.com%2Fcontract%2Fsamsung%2Fsamsung-\ngalaxy-s9-black%3Ftariffcode%3DDD1YEFEB18%26giftcode%3DNA16)\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=3202&clickref=TR-\nBestMobileDeals&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fsamsung%2Fgalaxy-s9-black%3Fcontracts%3D1)\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=3202&clickref=TR-\nBestMobileDeals&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fsamsung%2Fgalaxy-s9-black%3Fcontracts%3D1)\n\n###\n\n[Samsung Galaxy S9 – 30GB, £36pm, no upfront from Vodafone\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=3202&clickref=TR-\nBestMobileDeals&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fsamsung%2Fgalaxy-s9-black%3Fcontracts%3D1)\n\n30GB of data and no upfront cost for only £36pm?

If that’s not enough to tempt you, that new lower price tag\nmight, which comes in at £599 direct from Google and even cheaper elsewhere.\n\n  * **Read our[Pixel 2 XL review](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-2-xl)** **• Buy Now:[Pixel 2 XL SIM free for £629 / $647 from Google](https://store.google.com/gb/config/pixel_2?hl=en-GB)**\n\n## Moto G6: Great quality and value\n\n![Moto G6](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Pros:**\n\n  * Fantastic software experience\n  * __Lovely screen\n  * Well built for the price\n\n**Cons:**\n\n  * Some performance frustrations, especially with the camera\n\nLots of the phones on this list are pricey flagship devices, but that’s not\nthe case with the [Moto G6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/moto-g6).\nFor a shade under £220 you get a lovely display, slick software and a\nsurprisingly well-built phone.\n\nMoto does a good job at ditching gimmicks here. The few apps it adds on top of\nAndroid are thoughtful, and there’s no fussy skin ruining the Android\nexperience. There’s even basic facial unlocking, which is still a rarity at\nthe budget end of the market.\n\nOf course, there are some drawbacks at this price. The camera is fine, but the\napp is slow and you’ll often miss focus.

It’s an LCD, rather\nthan an OLED, but it can hit 1000 nits for HDR playback. This high brightness\nisn’t constant, instead, it peaks in bright sunlight and if you use the\nSuperBright mode.\n\nOn the back, you’ve got two cameras, with the main being a 16-megapixel _f/_\n1.6 shooter and the secondary a wide-angle sensor. The wide sensor is great,\nbut the regular camera is less impressive.

Pocophone, a new phone maker supported by Chinese tech behemoth\nXiaomi, launched its first handset, the F1, in India but its release is\nquickly expanding to new markets further-a-field all the time.\n\nConfidently-nicknamed by the company as the ‘master of speed’ the Pocophone F1\naims to deliver flagship-class performance while also serving itself up as an\ninsanely affordable handset, starting at just ₹20,999 (approximately\n£230/€260/$300). For such an aggressively low price tag, the phone boasts a\ndecent 6.12-inch extended Full HD+ display, 6GB or 8GB of RAM and it’s powered\nby the same chipset that most of the other top dogs in this lineup tote, the\nQualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor.\n\nEven the camera, a usual shortcoming of most affordable phones, doesn’t skimp\non quality; leveraging the same 12-megapixel primary sensor as the one found\non Xiaomi’s own 2018 flagship handset.\n\n  * **Read our[Pocophone F1 review](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/xiaomi-pocophone-f1)**\n\nStill not sure?
