In an update rolling out today, Alexa-enabled devices are now\noffering US citizens information from Ballotpedia on where and how they can\nvote the midterm elections, which take place on November 6.**\n\nIn a blog post, Amazon explained how Alexa users will be able to consult her\non what time the polls are open, what’s on the ballot in their area, and who\nis running for senate in their state.\n\nPerhaps most helpfully, the assistant will help with some of the more\nconfusing elements of the voting process. For example, users will be able to\nask: “Alexa, what does it mean to vote yes (or no) for [state] [ballot\nmeasure]”?\n\nAfter folks have cast their ballot on the races in their states, Alexa will\nprovide live updates from the Associated Press on how their chosen candidates\nare performing. So, it’ll be possible to ask questions like “Alexa, what’s my\nelection update?”, “Alexa, who is winning in [state]?”, and “Alexa, how is\n[candidate] doing in the election?”\n\n**Related:[Best Alexa Skills](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-\nskills-amazon-echo-2946222)**\n\nWhen all of the votes have been counted, users can ask Alexa what happened,\nhow many seats did their chosen party gain/lose and discover how a particular\ncandidate performed in his or her race.\n\nIn a [blog post](https://blog.aboutamazon.com/innovation/alexa-whats-my-\nelection-update), VP of Alexa Information Bill Barton wrote: “We believe voice\nprovides a unique, simple, and delightful way to learn about election\ninformation, and we want to be as helpful as possible for customers when\nthey’re preparing to vote and to offer real-time updates on polls and election\nresults.”\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThe company said its efforts here will help it prepare for future primary\nseasons and the Presidential election a couple of years from now.\n\n**Are you an Amazon Alexa loyalist?
