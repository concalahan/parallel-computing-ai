Much was obvious,\nunfortunately.\n\nIt will use ARM’s big.LITTLE architecture – specifically eight cores, four of\nwhich are A-53, four of which are the more powerful A-57.\n\nThe clock speed measured on the test was 1.50GHz. This is probably due to the\nslower A-53 being used, with actual chip clock speeds likely to sit closer to\n3.0GHz for the final release.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nIt’s worth noting that it is likely that Samsung will also release a\nSnapdragon 810-fuelled Galaxy S6 variant too.\n\n**Related:** [](https://www.trustedreviews.com/hubs/mwc-2015)[MWC 2015: What\nto expect from the Barcelona expo](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/sony-\nxperia-z4-may-miss-mwc-2015)\n\nAnother point to note is that the benchmark listed memory as 2873MB, which\nmeans there’s a 3GB RAM module on board.\n\nThis is in contrast to earlier rumours that [suggested we’d be seeing 4GB of\nmemory](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s6-edge-to-\nboast-4gb-of-ram-say-analysts) with the Galaxy S6.\n\nOf course, Samsung could very easily switch out to a bigger-capacity RAM\nmodule at a later date.\n\nWhatever the case, we’re likely to find out what the Galaxy S6 proper has in\nstore for us around the time of Mobile World Congress 2015, which runs from\nMarch 2 to 5.\n\n"}
