That means that no one, not evenWhatsApp itself, can see what you’re sending to your friends. Apple’s iMessageis also similarly encrypted.If you want an even more secure messaging app, you might want to considerusing Signal, which not only encrypts your messages but also discards yourmetadata whenever it can, offering an additional layer of privacy.In an ideal world everyone would be using Signal, but in reality you’re likelygoing to need to make compromises in order to be on the same platform as yourcontacts. In these instances we think WhatsApp is an acceptable compromise.Try to avoid using SMS to send sensitive information, as it’s entirelyunencrypted.
