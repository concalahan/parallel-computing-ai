This isn’t the 4G-enabled version of the device – which will go on\nsale later this year – so users will not be always-online without a connected\nsmartphone present.\n\nEE says the LTE version of the Samsung Galaxy Watch will be available\nexclusively to its customers later this year. The Bluetooth version does have\nstandalone GPS, so it won’t be completely useless if you want to leave your\nphone at home. Here are the options EE is providing:\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch Bluetooth – Standalone:  \n46mm Silver – £299  \n42mm Midnight Black – £279  \n42mm Rose Gold – £279\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch Bluetooth – Add to Plan:  \n46mm Silver – £26 per month + £13.00 upfront  \n42mm Black – £25 per month + £4 upfront  \n42mm Rose Gold – £25 per month + £4 upfront\n\nThere’s a range of colours – Rose Gold and Midnight Black (42mm), and Silver\n(46mm) – to choose from when you grab the Galaxy Watch. As for specs, there’s\na 7-day battery life, built-in GPS, wireless headphone compatibility, Samsung\nPay and much more baked within the Tizen OS.\n\n**Related:[Best smartwatch](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nsmartwatch-3434307)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n###  Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nIn his first look at the Galaxy Watch, our own Max Parker says the additional\nbattery life could be the key to usurping all other smartwatches on the\nmarket.\n\nHe writes: “The biggest selling point of the Galaxy Watch could very well be\nthe battery life. If this watch can go multiple days, then it instantly has a\nlead on most smartwatches, including the Apple Watch.”\n\nPricing and availability of the Galaxy Watch 4G will be made available later\nthis year.
