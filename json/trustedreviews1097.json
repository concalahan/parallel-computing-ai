Here’s everything you need to know about\nthe LG V40 ThinQ, including its price, specs, camera details, and UK release\ndate.**\n\nThe 6.4-inch LG V40 ThinQ was launched on October 3 and there’s little doubt\nits camera spec is the headline feature. Let’s take a closer look and what\nmakes it stand out from the crowd.\n\n## LG V40 ThinQ camera and specs\n\nIt’s almost certainly the first mainstream handset to launch with five\nshooters, with its three rear cameras matching the mighty [Huawei P20\nPro:](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/huawei-p20-pro) there’s a\n12-megapixel primary sensor, 16-megapixel wide-angle lens, and 12-megapixel\ntelephoto snapper. On the front of the device, there’s a dual-camera\nconfiguration comprised of one standard lens and one wide-angle sensor.\n\nWhich all sounds pretty impressive on paper, but we’ll have to wait and see\nhow the V40 ThinQ performs in the real world before deciding if it’s legit or\nsimply a novelty.\n\nElsewhere, there are all the specs you’d expect from a 2018 flagship. The\n6.4-inch edge-to-edge display is an OLED one with an 18:9 aspect ratio and\nQHD+ resolution (3120 x 1440 pixels) that packs a hefty 538ppi. Its design is\nreminiscent of the [LG G7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/lg-g7) ThinQ\nreleased earlier this year and it comes available in blue, red and grey colour\nschemes. It’s also waterproof to the\n[IP68](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/what-is-ip68-ip-ratings-\nexplained-2947135) standard.\n\nUnder the hood, there’s a [Snapdragon\n845](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/snapdragon-845-benchmark-phones-\nspeed-3390981) SoC from Qualcomm backed by 6GB of RAM, a base 64GB on-board\nstorage capacity (expandable via microSD), and a 3300mAh battery cell.\nMeridian tuned audio is a final selling point, and the LG V40 ThinQ supports\n32-bit DAC for good measure.\n\n**Read more:[Best Android phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nandroid-phones-3438996)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n## LG V40 ThinQ price and UK release date\n\nNow for some bad news.\n\nAt launch, LG didn’t reveal any plans to release the V40 ThinQ in the UK,\nthough it is set to hit shelves in the US this October.\n\nLG V40 ThinQ pre-orders go live in the States on October 11 or 12, depending\non which carrier you’re after (Verizon gets first dibs on the 11th), with the\ndevice slated to ship on October 19.
