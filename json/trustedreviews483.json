According to Planet Computers’\nrepresentatives, this means the Gemini will combine the portability of a\nsmartphone with the functionality of a 2-in-1 or keyboard-cased tablet.\n\nIt certainly looks the part in the flesh, though we’ll obviously have to wait\nto spend some more living day-to-day with one before passing a proper\njudgement. This should be arriving in the very near future, so watch this\nspace.\n\n**What’s your MWC 2018 highlight? Let us know in the comments below.** **  \n**\n\n"}
