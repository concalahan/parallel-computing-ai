After FF13 and its sequel I’d pretty\nmuch swore to never play another one again. I couldn’t face another sulky\nprotagonist, another round of endless cut-scenes, another baffling, overly-\nintricate plot. Even Lightning Returns couldn’t convince me to return. So\ntrust me when I tell you that what I’m going to tell you next seemed\nunthinkable a week ago. Final Fantasy 15 isn’t the best game of the year, but\nit’s definitely one of my favourites.\n\n**Buy Final Fantasy 15 from[Amazon UK](http://amzn.to/2DAiRyj) |\n[Amazon.com](http://amzn.to/2E5yElP)**\n\nAnd this is despite some pretty irritating flaws. The new action-oriented\nreal-time combat system might be brilliant, but it’s reliant on a camera which\nspends most of its time losing track of you, enemies and the action entirely.\nYour hero, Noctis, has a fantastically useful Warp ability that should play a\ncore part in any fight, but can only use it when there’s a specific point to\nwarp to, and many of the battlegrounds feature no such thing. If there is,\nfinding it with the aforementioned camera is often a nightmare.\n\n**Related:[Dissidia Final Fantasy\nNT](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/dissidia-final-fantasy-nt)** **  \n**\n\n**![Final Fantasy\n15](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \n**  \nThis is a game that’s designed to be accessible, yet contains dozens of nested\nsystems, some of which you’re guaranteed to forget for hours at a time.\nDungeons often come with no checkpoints or save points, but then feature a\ntough boss right at the end with the potential to send you back to square one,\nall progress and experience reset. The whole magic system is a near-disaster,\nfirst ignoring then restricting your use of the series’ signature summons,\nwhile focusing on an elemental form of sorcery that seems purposefully\ndesigned to wipe out your comrades as well as your foes. Both the PS4 and PS4\nPro versions suffer from noticeable frame-rate issues, though nothing that\nwill make the game unplayable.\n\nThen there’s the plot. I’m not one of those who thinks that the classic Final\nFantasy games are models of flawless narrative, but FFXV’s storyline seems to\nlurch from one beat and objective to the next with only the slightest attempt\nat any causality. You’re often left guessing whether the motives of key\ncharacters are mysterious or just incomprehensible, while the sudden shifts of\ntone between happy-go-lucky and sad and mournful or angry and vengeful – then\nback again – just don’t ring true. A lot of the real story seems to be\nhappening elsewhere, glimpsed only indirectly, and there’s no doubt that FFXV\nhas something of a villain problem. Must all Final Fantasies leave us\nhankering for a Sephiroth or Ultimecia?\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nYet I’ll forgive all this stuff and more, because Final Fantasy 15 is\nsomething the series (FFXIV excepted) hasn’t been in donkey’s years: fun. By\nputting a quartet of likable dudes on the road to open-world adventure,\nSquare-Enix has built a game with room to breathe, laugh, discover and\nexplore.\n\nIt helps that the world is a great one, merging the series’ traditional sci-\nfi, sword and sorcery with a sort of golden-hued 1950s Americana, swapping\nroute 66 for twisting highways linking up scattered outposts, dungeons,\nwilderness areas and cities. Your car might not be much fun to drive – even\nwhen you drive it manually it steers itself – but it’s a great way to get from\nA to B while shooting the breeze and listening to classic FF soundtracks. Go\noff-road on foot or on Chocobo and there’s always somewhere to go and\nsomething to do, whether that’s fishing, searching for meal ingredients,\ntaking bounty hunts on colossal critters or finding the treasure caches\nscattered liberally around. It’s not as rich a world as you’ll find in The\nWitcher III, but it has its own cool idiosyncrasies and its own vibe.\n\n**Related:[Best PS4 Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nps4-games)**\n\n![Final Fantasy 15\n5](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nMeanwhile it’s hard to think of another RPG where the party feels less like a\ngroup of characters with different gameplay and narrative functions, and more\nlike a genuine bunch of friends. The more you play the more you’ll come to\nlove Prompto, Gladiolus and Ignis – even miss them when they’re absent for a\ntime. There’s something of Uncharted in the way that the cast’s banter helps\nbring even the dullest moments to life.\n\nEach has a function, thanks to the combat system’s Techniques, but even then\nyou never see them as the healer, ranged fighter and damage dealer, just the\nguys you trust to have your back. Their extra-curricular duties – cooking and\nphotography – should be annoying, yet getting a new meal from Ignis or another\nbatch of candid shots from Prompto is one of the great pleasures of settling\ndown to camp. And while this focus on your core group comes at the expense of\nother characters – even those who get a guest slot in your party – FFXV still\nfinds time for some other memorable faces, despite some dubious wardrobe\nchoices for key female members of the cast.\n\nMost of all, FFXV is compelling. I had my doubts about the combat system but,\ndespite the silly camera, it makes each battle fast-paced, interesting and\nsurprisingly strategic, with a real emphasis on positioning and resource\nmanagement. You need to understand where and when to use Noctis’s summonable\nroyal weapons and when to stick to more basic arms, when to trigger power\nmoves and when to hold back. There’s a real art to using warp and warp strike\nmoves, and making the most of the Techniques that enable you to call in your\nfriends and their abilities, and then combine them with your own. It takes\ngetting used to – and more old-school RPG fans might prefer to make more use\nof the pause-able tactical mode – but this is the first Final Fantasy in years\nthat hasn’t felt bogged down by the fighting.\n\n**Related:[E3 2018 latest\nnews](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/e3-2018-games-news-trailers-\nannouncements-2949170)  \n**\n\n**![Final Fantasy\n15](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \n**  \nThere are some well-designed dungeons and missions in here too, even if some\nleave you wondering why Noctis doesn’t make more use of his Warp abilities to\nsneak past guards or get through chainlink fences and over walls. The set-\npiece fights and boss battles are often surprisingly strong, the monster hunts\ncan be tense and exciting and only the bizarre, poorly-handed stealth and\ndriving sections let the side down, though these are, at least, thankfully\nbrief. And though the structure grows more linear as the game goes on, there’s\na corresponding ramp-up with intensity, and you’ll still find moments of\ndowntime where you’re free to explore.\n\n**Buy Final Fantasy 15 from[Amazon UK](http://amzn.to/2DAiRyj) |\n[Amazon.com](http://amzn.to/2E5yElP)**\n\nThis is a strange one. It’s not a traditional Final Fantasy, a traditional\nJRPG or even one that plays to all the strengths of the genre or the\nfranchise. Yet there’s something really engaging and deeply satisfying about\nFFXV that leaves you feeling that if Final Fantasy hasn’t quite rediscovered\nits mojo, it’s at least found a map that tells it where its mojo is. Next time\nI’d like a better story, some issues ironed out, character progression made a\nlittle more exciting and the magic system redesigned, but I wouldn’t want to\nlose anything of what FFXV has brought to the series. It’s far from perfect,\nbut it’s a thing of joy.\n\n## Verdict\n\nFor all its flaws – the dodgy camera, the lack of dungeon save points, the\nmagic system, the bitty, oddly-structured plot – Final Fantasy 15 is the best\nsingle-player Final Fantasy in a decade. The new combat system is more action-\noriented, but still surprisingly tactical, while the new focus on open-world\nexploration brings the game and its world to life. Crammed with character,\nchoice and interest, it’s an RPG where the good times keep on rolling down the\nroad.\n\n## Score\n\n  \n\n"}
