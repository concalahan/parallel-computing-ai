And\nit’s out for Google’s own Pixel phones. That includes the original\n[Pixel](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel) and [Pixel\nXL](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-xl), plus the [Pixel\n2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-2) and[ Pixel 2\nXL](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-2-xl). Expect to see\nit come running on the upcoming [Pixel\n3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-pixel-3-release-date-specs-\nleaks-3316812), too.\n\nTop features include a tweaked look, altered volume controls and a new battery\nmode. I’ve tried these out in Android P’s beta versions, and now the final\nrelease.\n\n**[How to download and install Android Pie on your Pixel phone\ntoday](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-download-android-\npie-3412898)**\n\nIt’s a solid update. However, as of August 2018, several of the software’s\nmost interesting features are missing, including its ‘digital wellness’ suite.\nAs such, there’s no score score on this review.\n\nGoogle may call this a full release, but Android Pie has a few slices missing.\nAnd that’s the last ‘pie’ pun you’ll find in this review.\n\n## Android 9 Pie – A tweaked Material look\n\nWhen Material Design arrived in Android 5.0, it seemed a way for Android to\nfinally catch up with iOS simple aesthetic appeal. It was a consistent, cute\nlook found across Google’s apps and services.\n\nHowever, Google Pixel phones have started to look a little too ‘stiff’ next to\nsome third-party alternatives. Changes in Android Pie aim to address these\nconcerns, as if its designers realised that wearing a slim-fitting, v-neck\nT-shirt for four years doesn’t constitute ‘style’.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nAndroid 9 Pie offers far more colour. Feature switches in the dropdown control\ncentre are blue circles rather than plain text icons. And the virtually\nmonochrome Settings menu of Android 8.0 has been filled with colourful icons.\nIt looks more like the Settings area of a Samsung phone.\n\n**Related:[Best Android phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nandroid-phones-3438996)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n_Android 9.0 (left), Android 8.1.0 (right)_\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n_Android 9.0 (left), Android 8.1.0 (right)_\n\nIs it distinctly better? No, it’s just different. But as someone who switches\nbetween different Android UIs almost every week, I do find the Android 8.0\nPixel UI a little plain.\n\nThe homescreen has barely changed, however. Android Pie moves the clock from\nthe top right to the top left, but that’s about it.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n_Android 9.0 (left), Android 8.1.0 (right)_\n\nThere hasn’t been much movement in the apps menu either, aside from the App\nActions feature. Comparing directly to the Pixel 2 with Android 8.1.0 just\nbefore the update, the older interface uses a slightly more translucent\nbackground, revealing the homescreen background more clearly.\n\nAndroid 9.0 Pie has a near-opaque app drawer background. Big whoop.\n\nThe biggest visual change is seen in the Recent Apps multitasking screen.\nPreviously, app screens appeared as a semi-3D cascade, with only one ‘frozen’\napp clearly visible on-screen at once.\n\n**Related:[Best phone 2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nsmartphone-3431175)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAndroid Pie uses flat app previews, which you flick through like playing cards\narranged on a table. This looks more like iOS’s multi-tasking – and that’s no\ncriticism. It makes fast app-switching slightly less frustrating, and the page\nfits the visual style of the rest of the system better.\n\nThere’s also more packed into this multi-tasking screen. Two core elements\nfrom the top of the app drawer, the universal search bar and a row of apps\nicons, sit at the bottom of this screen.\n\n## Android 9 Pie – Gesture nav\n\nThis may seem a little odd until you play with Android Pie and become aware of\nwhere the recent apps menu sits.\n\nIn Android Oreo, the apps drawer sits ‘below’ the homescreen. You flick up to\nget to it, moving to page 2 of a book. The Recent Apps part appears to be\n‘behind’ the homescreen, as if you’re flipping all the way to the index\nsection at the back of a book.\n\nThat changes in Android Pie. The Recent Apps part is meant to feel much closer\nto the surface of the interface.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThis becomes clear when you switch on Gesture Navigation, one of Android 9\nPie’s key features at launch. It replaces the usual three soft keys with one,\nalthough a ‘back’ button appears next to it when appropriate.\n\nOne flick up on it from the homescreen takes you to Recent Apps, a second to\nthe App Drawer. The app-switching screen is now ‘between’ the homescreens and\napp catalogue, not behind or beneath them.\n\nIt took me a while to get used to this change. But, ultimately, it did make me\naware of the frequency with which I use app switching, and that the new Recent\nApps page is better than the old one.\n\nFor now, though, I’m sticking to the old-fashioned soft keys. It feels more\nfamiliar, obviously, and lets you access both the drawer and Recent Apps\nscreens with a single button press or gesture.\n\nIf you have Android Pie and want to try this gesture nav approach, it’s found\nin **_Settings > Gestures_**.\n\n## Android 9 Pie – Screenshots and images\n\nMost other interface tweaks are baked in, and less contentious.\n\nFirst, larger image previews can now appear in the notifications bar, as part\nof message alerts. It’s something devs will have to incorporate, but you can\nsee what it will look like from a screenshot sample:\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nYou can expect these kind of image previews to be used by WhatsApp and other\nmessenger apps, although it doesn’t work with WhatsApp yet.\n\nThe way in which Android Pie treats screenshots is also different. You still\npress power and volume down to capture one, but instead of a quick preview of\nthe screen, you’ll also see a system notification appear at the top of the\nscreen.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThis lets you quickly share screenshots. I use screengrabs all the time as an\neasy way to share Facebook posts, amusing images and other messages, usually\nvia WhatsApp. This new mechanic makes it much clearer that you don’t have to\ncapture such images and then share them from the gallery.\n\nThere’s also a quick button to edit them, usually a crop in my case. And if\nyou don’t want to share or edit the screengrab, it will just end up in the\ngallery.\n\n## Android 9 Pie – Volume\n\nThe new interface design also addresses a long-standing issue some have had\nwith Android’s volume controls. There are three types of volume in an Android\nphone: media, notifications/alerts and alarms.\n\nTraditionally, Android alters the notification volume as standard, unless a\ngame or audio is playing at the time. Android 9.0 Pie makes media volume the\ndefault. This may not seem to make a great deal of sense, until you try to\nplay a Spotify song to someone at the office, only for it to spit out at\nmaximum volume – and you’re left scrambling for the volume buttons, red-faced.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nA button above allows you to switch between vibrate, silent and standard\nnotification modes. And if you actually need to alter notification volume\nproperly, a long press takes you to an area in Settings with the usual volume\nsliders.\n\nThis is the part of Android 9 Pie I appreciate most at the moment. I use my\nphone to play audio, Spotify and podcasts, more than anything else.\n\n## Android 9 Pie – App Actions\n\nPlaying audio highlights another key Android Pie addition: App Actions. These\nbring shortcuts from installed apps onto the app drawer page, in (up to) two\nlittle boxes just below the first row of app icons.\n\nYou don’t choose what goes here, Android Pie does, based on your behaviour.\nShortcuts I’ve seen in this spot include playing Spotify’s Discovery Weekly\nplaylist, starting an activity in Google Fit, and playing the “most recent”\nepisode in Podcast Addict.\n\n**Related:[Best phone 2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nsmartphone-3431175)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSimilar shortcuts already exist in Android Oreo, found by long-pressing an app\nicon. However, I’ve never seen someone use these. App Actions makes us much\nmore likely to use them, but I’m torn on their effect.\n\nThese shortcuts make the apps page look less clean. They’re AI picked widgets\nfor the app drawer, and virtually everyone stopped using widgets years ago.\n\nGoogle says we’ll also see similar shortcuts appear in areas such as universal\nsearch results, but they don’t seem to be active in this initial version of\nAndroid Pie.\n\n## Android 9 Pie – Adaptive Battery and performance\n\nAnalysis of how you use your phone is also used to improve battery life,\nthrough Adaptive Battery. This may seem like a brand-new feature, but it’s\nactually an evolution of long-standing behind-the-scenes battery optimisation\nin the operating system.\n\nApps you use frequently have fairly free-ish access to background processes\nand data use. Those you’ve run once and haven’t touched since are tightly\nrestricted, ensuring they don’t suck up battery without purpose.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIt’s a fairly intuitive approach to power management that appears to be\nsimilar to Doze, a feature of Android M and N that reduces battery use while\nthe phone is in standby. Does it radically improve battery life? Not that I’ve\nseen, although it should help avoid phantom power drain months-in, when you’ve\naccrued a whole bunch of apps that you used for only a couple of days.\n\nGeneral performance doesn’t seem to be affected by the shift to Android Pie,\nalthough I have noticed a rare fractional delay in basic interface navigation.\n\n## Android 9 Pie – Text select magnification\n\nBack to the unequivocally good stuff: text selection is less fiddly in Android\nPie. You still long-press a word to bring up the selection tool, and drag\nmarkers to choose the right phrase or sentences.\n\nHowever, there’s now also a Magnification view of the part under your finger.\nThis makes selecting small phrases, or any text in zoomed-out articles easier.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe fiddliness of this function in older versions of Android is part of the\nreason I use the screenshot function so regularly these days. This change\narrives a little too late to take me back, but selecting text does feel a lot\nbetter. It’s more like doing so with an iPhone, which has a similar\nmagnification feature.\n\n## Android 9 Pie – Usage monitoring\n\nNot every important feature of Android Pie is live yet, however. The most\ntalked-about is missing: app use monitoring and restriction.\n\nThat we’re all frying our brains with compulsive social app use is a recurring\nidea of the moment. Android Pie will let you monitor how long you spend in\napps over time in Dashboard, and restrict your access to them per day with App\nTimer.\n\nFive years ago, this would have been about ensuring you refrained from\nspending five hours a day playing Candy Crush Saga. However, right now, social\napps are the prime targets.\n\nFaceBook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube are great candidates for this kind of\nfeature, if you quietly wish you didn’t spend so much time flicking through\nfeeds or entering a YouTube ‘suggested video’ vortex.\n\n**Related:[iOS 12\npreview](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ios-12-features-3385158)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe passive (Dashboard) side of usage monitoring seems unlikely to be\nparticularly useful. Android phones already give you a view of the amount of\nbattery and RAM consumed. The Dashboard seems a comparable feature I might dip\ninto every few months, look at the stats slightly horrified, and then continue\nmore-or-less as before.\n\nAllocating app time limits may be a ‘nanny state’-style approach, but it’s\nalso perhaps the best way to become more mindful about your actual phone use.\n\nThe idea that this will solve the problem of unhealthy phone use is\nridiculous. However, like the Pomodoro Technique, it should be genuinely\nuseful for those with the willpower to stick to it, using it to reverse\nunhealthy habits over time.\n\nApp Timers are coming later this year. And when you run out of ‘allowance’,\nthe app will grey out, restricting access.\n\nA new ‘bed time’ mode is coming, too, called Wind Down. Right now there’s\nNight Light and Do Not Disturb. These let you set a ‘sleep’ time, during which\nyou won’t be disturbed by notifications, and the display turns amber in the\nevening to reduce the display’s blue light quotient. Using your phone before\nsleep isn’t a great idea in any case, but reducing the blue light spectrum\noutput can decrease eye strain and sleep disturbance.\n\nWind Down brings these features together and adds a greyscale mode that kicks\nin to say: it’s time to put the phone down and go to bed.\n\nThe digital wellness parts of Android Pie are those I’m most keen to check\nout. Without them, this isn’t the full Android 9 experience. However, I’d\nrather Google releases them stable and well-optimised than as a wobbly mess\nthat destabilises the entire system.\n\n## Android 9 Pie – 802.11mc and indoors mapping\n\nThere’s another feature even further off, too. Android Pie adds support for\n802.11mc. This lets a phone triangulate its position indoors, and will be used\nto inform Google Maps tracking. It relies on multiple Wi-Fi hotspot signals in\nthe area, but your phone doesn’t have to be connected to them.\n\nWe’ll finally be able to see where we’re going properly when in shopping\ncentres and big supermarkets. Great. But Google will inevitably use this to\nfurther inform ad profiles and make more money with our data. Oh well.\n\nAt the moment it isn’t clear which phones are ready to use 802.11mc. However,\na dig into Wi-Fi supported standards suggests phones with Qualcomm flagship\nprocessors of the Snapdragon 820 generation or newer should be able to get on-\nboard.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Opening verdict\n\nThe initial Android Pie release isn’t the full package. It doesn’t have the\ndigital wellness tools that could help wean you off an unhealthy social media\nobsession. And other parts need to be adopted by third-party developers before\nwe’ll see them represented fully.\n\nHowever, there’s little to dislike strongly here. Performance and stability\nappear solid, useful interface tweaks are peppered throughout, and the\ncontentious gesture navigation feature is optional.\n\nAre App Actions worth the visual impact they have on the app drawer? Perhaps\nnot. But this rests on how much you’re into a simple look for software. Google\nshould consider adding an option to turn them off.\n\n"}
