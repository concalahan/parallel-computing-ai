Here’s how to get started, link your favourite apps and streaming\nservices and connect your smart home gadgets.\n\n**Related:[Best Christmas TV and\nfilms](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/best-christmas-tv-films-\nmovies-2016-uk)**\n\n## Getting to know the Amazon Echo\n\nBefore we get into the set-up, it’s wise to get to know the Echo hardware.\nThere are two buttons on the top, one to activate Alexa without using your\nvoice and one to turn off the microphone if you don’t want Alexa\neavesdropping. The digital assistant uses seven multi-directional microphones\naround the top of the device to pick up your commands. The one that picks up\nyour voice will light up to signify Alexa is ready for a command.\n\nThe LED ring can also be used to alter the volume of media. There’s no on-off\nbutton, but there is a factory reset button next to the power out that can be\naccessed with a pin or paperclip. There’s also a small LED light at the bottom\nof the device that indicates connectivity status. White = connected.\n\n**Watch: Amazon Echo Setup and Skills Guide**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n## Initial Amazon Echo Setup\n\nThere’s no doubting the Amazon Echo (especially the 2nd-generation model) is a\nhandsome gadget; certainly better looking than the Fire tablets! Once you’ve\novercome the wonder of the cylindrical 9-incher, it’s time to plug that bad\nboy in!\n\n– After plugging in the Echo, you’ll see the LED ring around the top of the\ndevice turn blue then orange. At this point the Echo will greet you.\n\n– Next you’ll need to download the Alexa app for iOS, Android or Fire. You can\nalso set up via your web browser\n[here](https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?showRmrMe=1&openid.return_to=https://alexa.amazon.com/&openid.identity=http://specs.openid.net/auth/2.0/identifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=amzn_dp_project_dee&openid.mode=checkid_setup&openid.claimed_id=http://specs.openid.net/auth/2.0/identifier_select&openid.ns=http://specs.openid.net/auth/2.0&).\n\n– Log in to your Amazon Account.\n\n– The next step is to use the app/browser to connect the Echo to your Wi-Fi\nnetwork. In the Alexa app, head to Settings and select Set Up A New Device.\nThen you’ll need to press the Action Button on top of the Echo (the one with\nthe dot, not the microphone) for five seconds.\n\n– A list of the available Wi-Fi networks will appear within the Alexa app.\n\n– Select your Wi-Fi network and enter the network password.\n\n– After that, you’ll see a confirmation message within the app and you’ll be\nready to use Alexa.\n\n![Echo](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Ask Alexa Anything\n\nTo get the most from Alexa all you have to do is ask. Start a sentence with\n“Alexa” and you’ll light the LED ring light. Depending on which of the multi-\ndirectional microphones pick up your voice, you’ll see a particular shade of\nblue. From there you can ask a tonne of stuff…\n\n**Related:[CES 2017](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ces-las-\nvegas-2017-news-highlights-rumours-dates-schedule-preview)**\n\n## Try everything!\n\nAmazon has got more or less everything right with the Echo, not least the\nAlexa app’s ability to ensure you’re au fait with everything she’s capable of.\nOne of the first things you should do following setup is to head into the\napp’s menu and select “Things To Try.” This will familiarise you with most of\nthe Echo’s core functionality.\n\n![Echo](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Training Alexa\n\nYour first few weeks with the Amazon Echo can lead to a little repetition as\nAlexa gets to know you. As such, no set-up is complete without voice training.\nHead to the Alexa app, hit the menu and select Settings. Choose Voice Training\nto go through 25 phrases that’ll help Alexas muddle through your thick\nregional accent.\n\n## Syncing your phone via Bluetooth\n\nThe multi-talented Amazon Echo is, at the very least, a decent Bluetooth\nspeaker enabling you to stream audio from your mobile device. All you need to\ndo is say “Alexa Pair” to put the Echo in discovery mode.\n\nNext up, ensure Bluetooth is switched on on your mobile device and head to the\nBluetooth Settings menu. Select the Echo. Once you’re connected, the Echo will\nremember. From then on you’ll only have to say “Alexa connect to [insert\ndevice name]” to pair.  \n**  \nRelated:**[ **Amazon Echo vs Tap vs Dot: Which to\nbuy?**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/amazon-echo-vs-amazon-dot-vs-\namazon-tap-difference)\n\n![Amazon Echo Dot and\nEcho](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Connecting to your favourite streaming services\n\nIf you’re an Amazon Prime member, you get access to the Prime Music library,\nbut if you’re a Spotify subscriber you’ll probably want access to your\nfavourite playlists. Here’s how to link your Echo.\n\n– Following set-up, open the Alexa app, hit the menu and select Music and\nBooks.\n\n– Tap Spotify from the list and select Link Account.\n\n– Enter your Spotify login details and select OK.\n\n**Related:[Best Alexa and Echo\nSkills](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-skills-amazon-echo)**\n\n## Choosing default music services\n\nYou can also make Spotify the default streaming service so you don’t have to\nadd “…On Spotify” to the end of every request or be subjected to Amazon Prime\npreviews. This also works for the stations like iHeartRadio and Pandora.\n\n– Open the Alexa app, hit the menu and select “Settings”.\n\n– Select Music & Media and then “Choose Default Music Services”.\n\n– Select your service of choice.\n\n![Echo\nMusic](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Setting up your calendar\n\nOnce you’ve synced your Google Calendar you’ll be able to ask “Alexa, what’s\non my calendar?” and she’ll read it to you. Head to the Alexa app and select\nSettings from the menu. Now, scroll down to Calendars and enter your Google\nAccount details.\n\n## Setting up your morning commute\n\nAlexa is a brilliant app to have around in the morning. She’ll wake you with\nan alarm, read the news (see below), tell you what’s on the calendar and, if\nyou have a connected pot, turn on your coffee maker. On top of that, the Echo\ncan also tell you how your commute is looking.\n\nOpen the Alexa app, select Settings>Traffic and add in your start and end\npoints. Speak “Alexa how is traffic” and she’ll tell you approximately how\nlong it’ll take you to get to work under the current conditions.\n\n## Customising your Flash Briefing\n\nIt doesn’t get that much love these days, but the Amazon Echo’s Flash Briefing\nfeature is brilliant. In 5-10 minutes while getting ready for work, you get\nnews round-ups from many of your favourite sources (*nudges _TrustedReviews_\neditors to get act together in 2017*) simply by saying “Alexa, what’s my flash\nbriefing?” or “Alexa, what’s the news?”\n\nHere’s how to customise your sources:\n\n– Head to Settings>Flash Briefing.\n\n– Select Get More Flash Briefing Content to view the available sources.\n\n– Tap a source and hit Enable Skill.\n\n– You can also customise the order in which breifings are delivered from the\nFlash Briefing Home screen.\n\n## Exploring Skills\n\nSince Amazon launched the Alexa Skills APK every man and his dog has been\nlinking their services. By heading to Settings in the Alexa app you can see\nthe most popular and then select “Add Skill” deploy them.\n\nFor example, once you’ve enabled the Uber skill you can simply say “Alexa ask\nUber to request me a ride.” Or, you can order a pizza delivery through\nDomino’s by saying “Alexa, open Domino’s and place my easy order.” Once it’s\non the way you can say “Alexa, ask Domino’s to track my order.\n\nThere are hundreds of Skills within the app so explore and find what works for\nyou beyond Uber and Pizza.\n\n## Connecting your Fitbit\n\nAs you roam though your journey with Alexa you’ll be adding tonnes of Skills\nalong the way. One of the first ports of call for many users is to hook up\ntheir wearable FitBit device. Once enabled, you can demand Alexa fill you in\non your fitness progress by saying “ask Fitbit how I’m doing today” for an\nupdate on your step count or “ask Alexa how I slept last night.”  \n**  \nRelated:[Fitbit Flex 2 review](https://www.trustedreviews.com/fitbit-\nflex-2-review)**\n\n![Fitbit Flex\n2](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\n## Do some shopping\n\nAmazon wants you to make purchases using the Echo. It’s pretty much the point\nof its existence. Anyway, seeing as it relies on a login to your Amazon\naccount at all times, you can simply buy with your voice using the default\n1-click order settings (the shipping address, payment method, etc).\n\nSaying “Alexa buy Uncharted 4,” will prompt the virtual assistant to inform\nyou of the top search price and whether it’s eligible for Prime shipping. She\nwill then ask whether you want to buy it. If you say yes, the order will be\ncompleted. If you say no, you’ll be advised to check the Alexa app for more\noptions.\n\nAlternatively, you can simply add items to your shopping list by saying “Alexa\nadd [item name] to your shopping list.\n\n**HOT TIP:** Say “Alexa what are your deals,” for some exclusive daily deals.\n\n## Setting up your smart home\n\nA huge part of Alexa’s allure is her ability to control your smart home. A\nlarge array of smart home gadgets and hubs can be controlled by voice. You can\nconnect to Philips Hue, SmartThings, Insteon, Honeywell and way, way more. In\nmost cases you’ll need to set-up the smart home device individually before\nconnecting it to the Echo:\n\n– Plug in your smart home device and download the companion app. Follow the\ninstructions to connect to your home Wi-Fi network (the same as the Echo).\n\n– Head to the Alexa app and select Menu>Smart Home>Get More Smart Home Skills.\n\n– Search for the Skill that matches your smart home device and select Enable\nSkill. You’ll be asked to link your accounts through the apps.\n\nSome smart home devices, such as the Philips Hue and WeMo hubs don’t require\nyou to enable a Skill within the App. You can simply say “Alexa, discover\ndevices.” Users of the Philips Hue bridge will need to press the button on the\nbridge before issuing the voice command.\n\nOnce you’re set up you’ll be able to use voice commands to control your smart\nhome devices. Check the Skill within the Alexa app to learn the phrases\nrequired.\n\n**Related:[Philips Hue review](https://www.trustedreviews.com/philips-hue-\nreview)**\n\n![Hue\nBridge](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Setting up a smart home group\n\nOnce you have a number of smart home devices set up, you can use the Alexa app\nto group them together. This is handy if you wish to dim all the lights in a\nroom, or lock all of your smart locks, etc.\n\n– To do this, open the Alexa app and tap the menu before selecting Smart Home.\n\n– Next Select Create group and give the group a simple name Alexa will\nunderstand like ‘bedroom lights’ for example.\n\n– Next you can select the Smart Home gadgets you’d like to add to the group\nand select Add.\n\n– Now you’ll be able to say “Alexa dim bedroom lights to 30%.”\n\n## Discover some Easter Eggs\n\nThe folks at Amazon have spent ages ensuring Alexa is fun as well as useful.\nAs such, there are loads of Easter Eggs you can try. Our favourite is “Alexa…\nParty On Wayne.” We’ll leave it up to you to find the rest.\n\n**WATCH: Amazon Echo review**\n\n**Let us know if you think we’ve missed anything in the comments.**\n\n"}
