When you’re holding it, this is the area which comes into\ncontact with you,” he explained\n\n“Using some of the basic concepts, the usual temperature we see is room\ntemperature, around 25°C.\n\n“The heaviest use cases we see tend to fall into two categories – this is\nirrespective of what processor is used or which form factor – and by their\nvery nature they require a lot of energy and processing.”\n\nDetailing these heavy user cases, he added: “Those who play really high-end\ngames or shoot 4K video, the skin temperature range can get into that range of\n35°C to 45°C.\n\n“That really defines the target of where we need to reside.”\n\nAccording to Leland, Qualcomm has managed to get the 810 chip to perform\ncomfortably within these heat ranges for longer periods of time.\n\n“If you look at the Snapdragon 800 – a very successful processor for Qualcomm\n– if you look at the target zones while playing Asphalt 8 at 30 frames per\nsecond, you can see after 15 to 20 minutes you start getting to the high end\nof that range of target zone for thermal design.\n\n“However, with the Snapdragon 810, using lessons learned from the 800, we have\nbeen able to extend the timeframe before you’re in that upper thermal zone\nwhile still enjoying 30 fps.\n\n“With the 810 you can go for more than half an hour. That’s quite a lot of\ntime for something that is generally considered a short-burst gaming\nexperience.\n\nDespite brushing some claims aside, McDonough was unable to end speculation\nthat the 810 chip heading for future devices will differ slightly from that\nfound in the [LG G Flex 2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/lg-g-flex-2-review)\nthat was unveiled at [CES 2015](https://www.trustedreviews.com/hubs/ces-2015).\n\n“I can’t tell you [if the G Flex 2 will feature the exact same 810 chip as\nforthcoming phones], that will be someone else’s job to tell you about,” he\nsaid.\n\n“We sell a lot of different chips to a lot of different OEMs, but we always\nlet them announce the handsets and what the specs are.”\n\n"}
