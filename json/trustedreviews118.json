The positioning tech\ngiveth, yet it also taketh away all too quickly.\n\nCasio thinks it has a solution for wanderlust-ing explorers within its newly-\nannounced Casio G-Shock Rangeman GPR B-1000, announced at [CES\n2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ces-2018-live-news-\nhighlights-3350586).\n\nThe timepiece, which has its own GPS system built-in, includes solar charging\ncapabilities. However, you’ll need four hours of sunshine to generate an\nhour’s worth of GPS battery life.\n\n**Related:[Best smartwatch](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nsmartwatch)**\n\nTaking the watch off and laying it flat for all that time might sound like a\nlot of effort for not a whole lot of gain. However, if you’re lost, that hour\nof power should be enough to get you back on track.\n\nThankfully, you’re going to have to be on a major expedition to require such\nan emergency measure. The Rangeman can continuously log your location for 33\nstraight hours before requiring a dose of sunlight.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n## Wireless charging too\n\nThe new model also includes wireless charging for the first time in the\nG-Shock range, which will bring the watch back to full strength in five hours.\n\nThe survivalist watch is designed to work in extreme conditions and can\nwithstand underwater depths of 200m and temperatures as low as -4 degrees\nFahrenheit.\n\nIt arrives in April and will cost a pretty penny at $800 (around £590).\n\nElsewhere, Casio revealed a limited edition of its Android Wear 2.0 watch, the\nWSD-F20. The WSD-F20WE will arrive in a run of just 1,500 and become available\nthis spring.\n\nIt features a fluorite white colourway, as well as a new ‘Journey’ watch face\nthat shows a map of the current location behind the analogue display.\n\n**What has been your favorite announcement of CES 2018 thus far?
