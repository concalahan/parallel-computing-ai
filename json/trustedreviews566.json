The first is having a thickness of\nless than 18mm, and the second is a weight of under 5lbs, or about 2.1kg. Fan\nnoise will have to be under 40dBA. This has all been made possible by a\ncombination of advanced cooling and much, much more efficient electrical\ndesigns, which Nvidia says has only become possible very recently.\n\n**Related:[Best gaming laptop](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-gaming-\nlaptop_round-up)**\n\nWhile those measurements by themselves might not sound exciting, consider the\nother requirement: you’ll need to be stuffing a [GTX\n1080](https://www.trustedreviews.com/nvidia-geforce-gtx-1080-review \"GTX 1080\nreview\") GPU into your thin and light laptop, which is no mean feat. This will\nresult in laptops with huge performance in 1440p and 4K games, without being\ndesk-bound lumps that you wouldn’t want to take anywhere.\n\nMax-Q laptops can also come equipped with GTX 1070s and 1060s as well.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n**Updated:** Nvidia has now provided us with more technical info on the Max-Q\nstandard, including the certification process.\n\nMax-Q is more than just a set of checkboxes. Max-Q laptops use a very specific\nformula to balance efficiency with power. For example, a GTX 1080-powered\nlaptop might use 120W of power on graphics, but that last 60W of power equates\nto 10% performance gains. Instead, Max-Q laptops are locked to a lower power\nconsumption (60W, for example), but are still able to put in a performance\nthat’s 90% as good as a GTX 1080 at full tilt. Sounds like a good compromise\nfor a thin and light laptop, right?\n\nMax-Q laptops have to be individually approved and tested by Nvidia before\ngetting Max-Q branding. It’s an intense testing process that involves laptop\nmakers handing Nvidia all of their fan information and cooling system\nspecification. This is because Nvidia then makes a custom fan profile for each\nindividual laptop, which is then tested to see whether it meets the 40dBA\nlimit when at full load.\n\nThere’s also WhisperMode, a new feature coming to all Nvidia 10-series\nlaptops. This new feature lets gamers switch into a less power-hungry mode,\nwith Nvidia’s software automatically adjusting a game’s graphics settings to\neither drop quality or framerate. On Max-Q laptops, this will drop fan speed\nto 32dBA. By comparison, the average noise floor of a room is around 30dBA, so\nthis will make your gaming laptop very quiet indeed.\n\n**Let us know what you think of the new Max-Q standard in the comments.**\n\n"}
