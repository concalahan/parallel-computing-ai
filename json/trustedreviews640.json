Let’s take a\nlook at how the specs, design, features, camera and price compare.**\n\nWe’ve scarcely had a moment to appreciate the [Galaxy Note\n8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-8) and, already,\nwe’ve been treated to a new Android flagship in the [LG\nV30](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-v30-release-date-specs-features-\nprice-uk-daydream-rumours-2993201).\n\nFor those who don’t know, the V30 is the successor to the LG V20 – better\nknown as the best phone of 2016 that never actually came to the UK.\n\n## **O2 Tariff Offers**\n\nTrusted Reviews has partnered with O2 to offer you tariff deals for must have\nproducts.\n\n**Buy Now:[Samsung Galaxy S8 (10GB) from £50/month, upfront £19.99 at\nO2](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3235&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-O2deal&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.o2.co.uk%2Fshop%2Fphones%2Fsamsung%2Fgalaxy-s8%23contractType%3Dpaymonthly%3F)**\n\nSo just how do the two new Android powerhouses compare? We’re here to explain\nall.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n## LG V30 vs Galaxy S8 design – What’s the difference\n\nFrom a distance, the LG V30 and Samsung Galaxy S8 have similar design traits.\nBoth are curved on the front and back – the S8 much more so – and they both\nhave stretched displays that leave almost no room for a bezel. This modern\nlook was made iconic by Samsung, but it looks just as good on the LG V30.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe V30 is slightly bigger than the regular-sized Galaxy S8 and smaller than\nthe Galaxy S8+; arguably, LG’s latest flagship feels like the perfectly sized\nphone. The S8 is slightly narrower, though.\n\nThe materials from which both phones are made are also alike. Both use Gorilla\nGlass 5 on both the front and rear of the devices, with a metal rim adding\nsome rigidity in the middle. They both feel great in the hand, although we’ll\nneed to spend more time with the LG V30 to see if it’s quite as well built as\nthe S8.\n\n## LG V30 vs Galaxy S8 specs – Which Android phone is more powerful?\n\nIn theory, we’re on equal ground here, since the LG V3o and Galaxy S8 both\npack Qualcomm’s [Snapdragon\n835](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/snapdragon-835-phones-processor-\nspecs-speed-benchmark-chipset-cores-2944086) chipset, 4GB of RAM and a base\nstorage of 64GB. But there’s more to it than that.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nWhere the Galaxy S8 sports a 5.8-inch screen, the LG V30 goes larger with a\n6-inch display, so potential buyers wanting to consume media might want to\nconsider LG’s latest more seriously. Unless you want to go bigger still with\nthe S8+’s 6.2-inch display, that is.\n\nBoth handsets have OLED panel with quad-HD+ resolutions and the ability to\ndisplay HDR content, although note that this content remains limited.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe other major point of order is that the LG V30 comes with Quad DAC audio\nsupport, and while Samsung hasn’t quite ditched the headphone jack yet, this\ngives the V30 a likely win over the Galaxy S8 in terms of audio quality.\n\nWe haven’t as yet fully reviewed the LG V30 and so don’t quite know how well\nits camera performs, but what we do know are the specs. On the rear it packs\none 16-megapixel camera with OIS and an f/1.6 aperture, and a secondary\n120-degree wide-angle 12-megapixel camera. The Galaxy S8, on the other hand,\nhas only a single 12-megapixel camera with an f/1.7 aperture.\n\nMegapixel metrics are never the true measure of how good a smartphone’s camera\nis, so we can’t stress enough that if this is your primary purchasing decision\nthen you should wait until we’ve vetted LG’s latest fully. (Samsung’s unit,\nfor what it’s worth, is excellent).\n\nKeeping the phones running all day is a 3300mAh battery inside the V30 and a\n3000mAh cell inside the Galaxy S8. Both support fast charging, plus wireless\ncharging.\n\n## LG V30 vs Galaxy S8 price and release date – Which should I buy?\n\nThat’s an impossible question to answer right now. The Samsung Galaxy S8 has\nalready proved to us that it’s one of the year’s best smartphones, while we\nstill need to spend some more time with the LG V30 before offering our final\nverdict.\n\nIn reality, the Galaxy S8 is more likely the true [iPhone\n8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-8-release-date-specs-rumours-\nprice-uk-2993101) rival, but that doesn’t mean that you should discount the LG\nV30 altogether – it offers distinct features that you won’t find elsewhere,\nincluding a Quad DAC and that wide-angle camera.\n\n  * **Buy now:** [**Galaxy S8 (4GB) on Vodafone – £23/month, £175 upfront – use voucher TRUSTED10**](https://www.awin1.com/pclick.php?p=21346066575&a=277673&m=380&clickref=tr-mobiledeals-s8)\n  * **Buy now:**[ **Galaxy S8 (8GB) on Three, £32/month, £29.99 upfront**](https://www.awin1.com/pclick.php?p=13915267781&a=277673&m=3202&clickref=tr-mobiledeals-s8)\n\n![galaxys8\n31](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nFor the full, end-to-end premium smartphone experience, then, you may be\nbetter served by the Samsung Galaxy S8 – but those looking for something\ndifferent should take a long hard look at the LG V30. It might just satisfy,\nor even exceed, your needs.\n\nWe don’t yet know how much the V30 will cost, or even when it will hit the\nmarket, and as such it’s impossible to compare value. But considering the\nhigh-end features, we’d expect it to be in the same price range as the £689\nGalaxy S8.\n\n**Which Android flagship floats your boat?
