Nintendo has revealed that a new title in the Animal\nCrossing series is in the works for [Nintendo\nSwitch](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nintendo-switch). Revealed\nduring a recent [Direct\nPresentation](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/nintendo-direct-how-to-\nwatch-2-3552610), it will be a mainline entry in the series, following in the\nfootsteps of 2013’s New Leaf and 2015’s Happy Home Designer. Little else is\nknown beyond this, but we’re already super excited.\n\n_Trusted Reviews_ has compiled everything you need to know about Animal\nCrossing for Nintendo Switch including all the latest news, release date,\ntrailers, wishlist and more.\n\n**Related:[Black Friday Nintendo\nSwitch](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/nintendo-switch-deals-black-\nfriday-2993180)**\n\n## Animal Crossing Switch – what is it?\n\nAt the time of writing, we don’t have a concrete idea of what Animal Crossing\nSwitch will entail, or how it aims to expand upon the existing formula. It is\na main entry in the series, so is on the same playing field as New Leaf and\nnot a spin-off like Happy Home Designer, which wasn’t as well received by\nfans.\n\n## Animal Crossing Switch release date – when is it coming out?\n\nIt was confirmed during a recent Nintendo Direct that Animal Crossing Switch\nwill be launching for the platform in 2019. Nothing else was mentioned beyond\nthat.\n\n## Animal Crossing Switch trailer – how does it look?\n\nAdorable! While we weren’t subject to any gameplay footage, we were treated to\ntwo Animal Crossing trailers during the aforementioned Direct. The first of\nwhich was a teaser which led to Isabelle’s announcement as a playable\ncharacter in [Super Smash Bros\nUltimate](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/smash-bros-ultimate-release-\ndate-news-gameplay-2949964):\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nNext up is the announcement trailer, although this doesn’t contain any\ngameplay footage. Instead, it features everyone’s favour loan shark, Tom Nook,\nas he fiddles with a light switch on his desk. It’s fun, adorable and an\nunbearable tease for what’s to come:\n\n**Related:[Best Nintendo Switch\nGames](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/nintendo-switch-games-3435122)**\n\n## Animal Crossing Switch Wishlist – What we want to see\n\n**A bigger, more lively town**\n\nThis marks the first time Animal Crossing steps in the realm of HD gaming,\nwith the exception of Amiibo Festival, but we don’t talk about that\nmonstrosity. Knowing this, we’re hoping it aims to take advantage of the added\npower to provide us with a bigger and more ambitious city to explore.\n\nNew Leaf was relatively small due to its portable origins, providing us with a\nquaint village and a few additional locations to explore. It was lovely, yet\nafter 50 hours or so you were recycling the same routine in exchange for bells\nand new decorations for your humble abode.\n\nWe’d love for the Nintendo Switch release to introduce an entirely new town or\neven a small city for us to explore and make our own. We’re talking bigger\nhouses, prettier gardens and even more townsfolk to befriend and fall in love\nwith. Speaking of…\n\n**Related:[Upcoming Nintendo Switch\nGames](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/upcoming-nintendo-switch-\ngames-3522184)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Meaningful relationships!**\n\nI’ll never forget the day Antonio the Anteater abandoned me, moving to a\nfaraway town when all I ever did was shower him with love? Was I too clingy?\nI’ll never know, forever living with regret. In case you hadn’t guessed,\nAnimal Crossing does an excellent job of making your villagers mean something.\n\nNot that they didn’t already, but a more meaningful connection represented by\nin-game events, rewards and perhaps even the option to marry other humans and\nmove into the same village together.\n\nMany of the things we’d love to see are inspired by Stardew Valley, largely\nbecause of how creatively it expands the formula. Relationships are one of\nthem, and the idea of forming a family in the world of Animal Crossing sounds\nachingly adorable.\n\n**More tasks to complete**\n\nWe love Animal Crossing, but the repertoire of tasks thrust upon you did grow\nrepetitive after a while. Speaking with neighbours, digging up fossils and\nfishing by the beach resulted in countless bells you could treat yourself\nwith, but it was the same thing every day when boiled down.\n\nPerhaps the option to run our own business and scour dungeons like in\nMoonlighter could provide the entire experience with another layer of depth.\nNot only are we running the village as mayor, but you’re also actively\nsupporting the inhabitants financially. That’ll show, Tom Nook!\n\n**More fashion!**\n\nThe Nintendo 3DS didn’t have much power but allowed Animal Crossing to shine\nthrough thanks to truly fantastic art direction. Colours popped and character\ndesigns were made adorable thanks to charming dialogue and sound effects.\n\nWe’ve caught a few glimpses at how Animal Crossing looks in HD on Wii U, but\nthis will be the first time we see a fully-fledged adventure on a more\npowerful console. Even if Isabelle has run off to Super Smash Bros, they’ll\nstill be plenty of cute animals strutting about the place with awesome\ndesigns.\n\nWe want more adorable options, shops and means of customisation when it comes\nto our own character. Whether its outfits, faces or even sound effects we emit\nwhile pottering about the village.\n\n**Are you looking forward to Animal Crossing on Nintendo Switch?
