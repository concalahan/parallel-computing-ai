What is 8K upscaling?With so little content currently available, 8K right now is really all aboutupscaling, and from what we’ve seen at recent shows, the results can be prettyimpressive.For example, Samsung’s Q900R uses the company’s new Quantum Processor 8K chip,which uses ‘AI upscaling’ to boost lower-res footage to 8K.This uses complex algorithms to recognise patterns in images and calculate theextra pixels required to fill in the gaps that 4K (or even HD) is missing. Thechip uses a huge image database, which Samsung says will be constantly updatedto keep it as accurate as possible.Sony showed off similarly impressive upscaling at CES 2018 using a concept 8Kpanel and its forthcoming X1 Ultimate processor, though that remains very mucha ‘watch this space’ endeavour for now.## 8K vs 4K TVs: Should I buy a 4K TV or wait for 8K?That’s the big question and, for now at least, the answer is pretty clear cut.As there’s not really any true 8K content yet, you’d only really be buying an8K TV for bragging rights and to get a glimpse of its potential via upscaling– we’re still a long way from seeing 8K hit the mainstream. After all, there’sonly really one 8K TV you can likely buy!Remember: 4K is still far from ubiquitous, and given the amount of investmentin the technology by major networks, studios and companies, it’s extremelyunlikely it will be usurped any time soon in the consumer market.Those wanting to get the most out of their TV viewing experience right nowshould therefore buy 4K – whether it’s as an upgrade from Full HD or a ‘goodto great’ 4K swap.
