{"result": 0, "title": "Spotify is going public, but it's doing it a little differently from most", "description": "![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**On the 3rd of April, Spotify is becoming a listed company on the New York\nStock Exchange, meaning that its shares will be publicly traded for the first\ntime and anyone will be able to invest in the music streaming giant.**\n\nHowever, this is slightly different from the initial public offerings (IPO)\nthat most companies go through when they’re first listed on a stock exchange.\n\nRather than offering an IPO, Spotify will instead be holding a ‘direct\nlisting’. The difference here is that unlike an IPO, where a company announces\nahead of time how many shares it will be making available at a pre-defined\nprice, a direct listing means that anyone who already owns Spotify shares will\nbe able to sell them, or they might not.\n\nIn effect, this means that we won’t know how many shares will be available (or\nat what price) until they start being traded. The result is likely to be a\nlarge amount of stock volatility while the market works out what it thinks of\nSpotify, and it could take weeks for the price to settle down.\n\n## Spotify stock price: From $50 to $130\n\nThe Financial Times [reports\nthat](https://www.ft.com/content/ab43f772-332a-11e8-b5bf-23cb17fd1498) in\nearly documents Spotify has indicated that share prices could range from\n$48.93 to as much as $131.88, but the first shares won’t be traded for hours\nwhile financial advisers go about matching buying and sellers on the stock\nexchange floor.\n\nThis is an important moment for the tech world. Completing a successful IPO\nrelies on an army of traditional Wall Street bankers and intermediaries to set\nshare prices, help with adhering to regulations, and generally make the sale\nhappen. For all this work, these intermediaries charge commissions of between\n2% and 8% [according to](https://www.investopedia.com/news/what-difference-\nbetween-ipo-and-direct-listing/) Investopedia, which cuts into the money\nraised by a company that’s going public.\n\nTraditional financial institutions will still have a role to play in the\ndirect listing by advising buyers and sellers of the stock, but many are\nseeing this as a sign the tech world might be becoming less reliant on\ntraditional banks.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nBut equally, this might not change much in the grand scheme of things. Spotify\nis in the enviable position of being a household name while also controlling\nthe lion’s share of the entire music streaming business. Few other privately\nowned companies are going to reach this position before being in a position to\ngo public.\n\n**Do you think Spotify is a good investment? Let us know @TrustedReviews.**\n\n"}
