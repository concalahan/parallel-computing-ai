Hereâ€™s how to turn off automatic\nSnapchat updates and ensure you retain your social media sanity in future.**\n\nApp updates a normally a good thing, but Snapchatâ€™s latest effort has left\nusers fuming, thanks to a series of sweeping changes. Its radical redesign\nhas, among other things, introduced an overhauled â€˜Discoverâ€™ tab that now\nhighlights videos from people you arenâ€™t friends with and is prioritised based\non what Snapchat thinks youâ€™re going to like (aka the data it harnesses on\nstuff youâ€™ve previously clicked on).\n\nNeedless to say, #SnapchatUpdate started trending immediately on Twitter when\nthe update dropped â€“ but perhaps not as the company might have hoped.\n\nHereâ€™s a quick sample of the mood on social media.\n\n> Snapchat have gotten rid of the \"my story\" part of Snapchat!! Wtf they might\nas well delete the camera option as well and just call it \"chat\" ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜‚\n[#snapchat](https://twitter.com/hashtag/snapchat?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n[#snapchatupdate](https://twitter.com/hashtag/snapchatupdate?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n>\n\n> â€” Chloe Angel (@chloeeangeel) [February 6,\n2018](https://twitter.com/chloeeangeel/status/961001534418022400?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nBut enough moaning. Letâ€™s look at some preventative measures you can employ in\nfuture.\n\nFirst though, itâ€™s worth pointing out that thereâ€™s new hope for disgruntled\nSnapchat users. A workaround has been found that allows you to get rid of the\ncontroversial new version of Snapchat and revert to the old one. It has been\nimplemented with some success, so while thereâ€™s no guarantees itâ€™ll work for\nyou, hereâ€™s what to try if you want [undo the 2018 Snapchat\nupdate](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/undo-snapchat-update-\nfebruary-2018-get-rid-remove-petition-3392828) on iPhone.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexaâ€™s new whisper mode rolls out in US today â€“ hereâ€™s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexaâ€™s new whisper mode rolls out in US today â€“ hereâ€™s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action â€“ from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction â€“ from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nIf youâ€™ve already had the new Snapchat update installed on your phone and the\nworkaround mentioned above doesnâ€™t succeed, thereâ€™s not much we can do to\nhelp. You canâ€™t really â€˜undoâ€™ app updates â€“ unless youâ€™re an Android whiz,\nmanaged to keep the APK of the old version on a secondary device, and then are\nable to manually extract it and flash it back to your primary device.\n\nEven then, this is a speculative method based on old Android forum posts that\nmay or may not work with newer versions of the OS. We havenâ€™t tested it and\ndonâ€™t really recommend trying it â€“ inadvertently bricking your smartphone\nisnâ€™t a great way to spend a cold winterâ€™s night.\n\nIf youâ€™re here, however, because youâ€™ve heard the new Snapchat update sucks\nand want to ensure you donâ€™t have it forced on you by an annoying auto-update,\nwe can definitely help.\n\nWhat you need to do is disable automatic updates, and thatâ€™s pretty easy.\n\nIf youâ€™ve got an iPhone, simply navigate to Setting > iTunes & App Store.\nThere, under the â€˜Automatic Downloadsâ€™ header, youâ€™ll see a series of toggles.\nTurn the â€˜Appsâ€™ one to off and, if you want to be doubly sure, â€˜Updatesâ€™ as\nwell.\n\nFor Android, you have two options. You can disable all auto updates by heading\nto the Play Store, firing up the main menu, and then hitting Settings. After\nthat, youâ€™ll see an option to disable automatic app updates. As Snapchat isnâ€™t\nthe first (and wonâ€™t be the last) app to force an unwanted, irreversible\nupdate on its users, this is the option we recommend.\n\nAlternatively, you can navigate to Snapchatâ€™s page in the Play Store, hit the\nmenu icon (which consists of three vertical dots), and then deactivate\nautomatic updates for Snapchat specifically.\n\n**Related:[How to delete Facebook](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-\ndelete-facebook-account-2950145)**\n\nThatâ€™s all there is to it!\n\n_**Tweet your thoughts about the new #SnapchatUpdate to us @TrustedReviews.**_\n\n"}
