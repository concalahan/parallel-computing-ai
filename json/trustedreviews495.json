It’s taking on the likes of the\n[Amazon Echo](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/amazon-echo) and [Google\nHome](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-home), but promises far\nsuperior sound quality in the vein of the [Sonos\nOne](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sonos-one).\n\nIt’s a shame then that, for all its audio capabilities, it lacks the slickness\nwe’ve come to expect of an Apple device.\n\n**Related:[Best Bluetooth speakers](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nbluetooth-speakers)**\n\n![HomePod touch\ncontrols](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## HomePod – Design\n\nThe HomePod doesn’t take up much space at all. It’s as comfortable sitting on\na side table as it is on a bookshelf, and it doesn’t cramp a space – an\nimportant selling point for any smart speaker.\n\nIt’s handsome, too, without making a huge design statement. Available in Space\nGrey or White, it will easily blend into most home decors. Like most AI-\npowered speakers, the HomePod connects wirelessly. The only cable on show is\nthe power lead.\n\nThe power cable is built in, so it can’t be replaced if it were to snap down\nthe line, or if a naughty pet decides that it will make a tasty chew toy. That\nsaid, it’s covered in a tough braid that I don’t see splitting without a great\ndeal of effort.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nControls on the HomePod are kept to a minimum. There’s a touch panel at the\ntop that lets you control volume or skip tracks. A single central button lets\nyou turn the speaker on and off, pause, or manually activate Siri.\n\nThe HomePod is covered in a seamless cloth grille, which Apple claims lets\nsound emanate without altering it in any way.\n\n**Related:[Amazon Prime Day](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-amazon-\nprime-day-2018-deals-3482743)**\n\n![HomePod\ncable](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe most surprising part of the HomePod’s design is its weight. While it might\nlook small, it weighs 2.5kg. Picking it up is a bit of a shock.\n\nIt’s heavy because Apple has packed a lot in – and its weight may be one of\nthe reasons the HomePod has already become a little infamous.\n\nSome HomePod owners have complained that it leaves white rings on wooden\nfurniture. This may be a result of oils in the silicone foot, but I can’t say\nthis has been an issue for me. I’ve kept it on a white gloss surface and on\ntreated oak for several days without a problem.\n\nAccording to Apple, the ring should disappear after moving the HomePod. A\nbetter solution would be to place the device on a small disc of paper or a\n[coaster](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/heres-perfect-low-tech-solution-\nhomepod-white-ring-problem-3397605).\n\nIt’s annoying, yes, but no deal-breaker – unless it damages your furniture\nbeyond repair. I haven’t heard of that happening.\n\n## HomePod – Specs\n\nThe HomePod is teeming with audio goodies that make it sound far better than\nother AI-powered speakers.\n\nThere’s a chunky woofer powered by a custom amp, a 360-degree seven-tweeter\narray, and a six-mic array for capturing your voice from a distance. The mics\nwork well and pick up voices capably, even at a distance and with music\nblaring.\n\nThe mics also inform the HomePod about the layout of the room. This lets the\ndevice decide how best to fill the space with sound.![Apple HomePod on\nbookshelf](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe idea is that if you put it in the centre of a room, it will pump out tunes\nall the way around. Put it against a wall and it will adapt to take the solid\nsurface into account, sending centre vocals to the fore while reflecting\nambient reverb and backup vocals against the wall.\n\nThere’s even an accelerometer in the HomePod to register when it’s been moved,\nand to recalculate its position all over again. The result is that you get an\noptimised audio experience regardless of where you are in the room.\n\nAll this, combined with Siri smarts, requires plenty of processing power, and\nthis is the reason Apple packs an A8 processor into the HomePod. That’s the\nsame processor that features in the iPhone 6, and it’s significantly more\npowerful than those in the Amazon Echo or Google Home. This should futureproof\nthe HomePod somewhat.\n\nThe HomePod also comes packing Bluetooth 5.0, but crucially, this isn’t open\nto all Bluetooth-compatible devices. As already mentioned, you’ll need an\nApple device to set up and get the most out of Apple’s speaker.\n\n## Apple HomePod – Sound quality\n\nThere’s plenty of tech packed into the HomePod, then, but this doesn’t\nguarantee quality sound. The big question is whether the HomePod can take on\nthe might of Sonos – and, in particular, our favourite smart speaker so far:\nthe [Sonos One](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sonos-one).\n\nWhen it comes to audio, the HomePod comes out on top; it sounds even better\nthan the larger [Sonos\nPLAY:3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sonos-3). Where the Sonos can\nsometimes muddy complex songs, the HomePod keeps everything tight and defined.\n![HomePod\nspecs](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nMy wireless speaker of choice is the [Raumfeld One\nS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/raumfeld-one-s), because it’s small\nin size but big on sound. It may be louder than the HomePod at top levels, but\nit’s nowhere near as crisp – and bass response from Apple’s speaker is streets\nahead. The deep and clear bottom end is a particular highlight; you can\nactually feel it in your gut. It’s incredible for a speaker of this size.\n\nListen to Basstronics’ ‘Bass I love you too’ on a lesser smart speaker and a\nwhole gamut of low-end disappears entirely, or just buzzes awkwardly. The\nHomePod manages to express all the frequencies brilliantly.\n\nThere’s a surprising warmth and expansiveness to the HomePod’s sound, too – it\nhas a huge soundstage that belies its size. You can hear the intricacies in\nthe sound; there’s none of the audio muddying from which other smart speakers\nsuffer. It’s leagues ahead of Amazon and Google’s offerings – but then it also\ncosts a whole lot more.\n\n![HomePod and Amazon\nEcho](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe HomePod next to the original Amazon Echo\n\nAnother highlight is the neutrality of the sound. It’s a wonderfully balanced\ntone. There’s enough weight for vocals and instruments to feel substantial and\nauthoritative, but not so much that the performance sounds thick and\ncumbersome. It feels very natural.\n\nEven more impressive is that it maintains this natural sound, no matter where\nin a room you place the speaker. The room-calibrating processing works. Most\nspeakers sound too rich when placed up near a wall, but the HomePod maintains\nits composure – unless it’s actually touching a wall. There’s no ‘sweet spot’\nin which you need to sit to make the most of the HomePod. It sounds crystal-\nclear wherever you are in the room.\n\nIt doesn’t matter what type of music you throw at it – rock, jazz, classical,\npop or hip-hop are all rendered with beautiful clarity and detail.\n\nTake the ramping guitar shredding in Radiohead’s ‘Creep’, which often\noverwhelms lesser speakers and comes out as noise – but here it has its place.\nIt makes emotional sense and authentically supports Thom Yorke’s vocals\nwithout ever threatening to steal the spotlight.\n\nIf there’s one criticism to level at the HomePod’s audio performance it’s that\ntop volume is by no means earsplitting. It filled my 5 x 5m room, but venture\ntoo far from that – or place it at a noisy party – and you might wish you\ncould turn it up to 11. On the plus side, it sounds as good at full blast as\nit does at any other volume. There’s no sign of distortion at all.\n\n_(Update: A software update to the HomePod has changed the sound profile. It’s\nstill clean and crisp, but it favours bass more than it did before, which\nleaves it a little less balanced)_\n\n## Apple HomePod – Setup and Siri\n\nSetting up the HomePod is a doddle. Turn it on and then place your iPhone\nnearby. As long as you have two-factor authentication turned on and Keychain\naccess enabled, the HomePod will get all the settings it needs to work – like\nWi-Fi, for example.\n\nDon’t have an iPhone or iPad? Well then there’s no way of setting up the\nHomePod, so you’ll need to look elsewhere for your smart speaker needs. Apple\nhas locked the HomePod to its ecosystem tightly.\n\n![Apple HomePod\nSiri](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)Non-Apple users in your household can use it,\nhowever, even if the iPhone used to pair it with isn’t in proximity. Unlike\nSpotify you can use Apple Music, via Siri, on the HomePod at the same time\nthat you’re listening on your iPhone. And, if you have more than one HomePod,\nyou can listen to different tracks on each one, all using a single Spotify\nsubscription. That is handy.\n\nOnce set up, you can activate the HomePod by saying, “Hey, Siri”. But this is\nwhen frustration hits.\n\nLet’s start with Siri as a smart assistant. The voice assistant was a great\nfeature when it first appeared on the iPhone 4S, way back in 2011. By no means\nperfect, it did offer a hint at a future where machines and humans would\ninteract in a more natural way.\n\nUnfortunately, it hasn’t moved on much. Yes, Siri can tell you the weather,\nwhich football matches are on, and even control some of your smart-home kit.\nHowever, placed next to Amazon’s Alexa or Google’s Assistant, the original AI\nassistant feels like a pale imitation.\n\nFor starters, you’ll have to use Apple Music to fulfil your audio requests.\nSure you can cast Spotify or Tidal to the HomePod through AirPlay via your\niPhone, [Apple TV](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/apple-tv-4k) or\niPad, but that comes with its own set of problems.\n\nIf you want to use your phone at the same time then it will interrupt the\nmusic and audio from a game, or video will come pumping out instead. On top of\nthat, when your paired iPhone’s screen is on and you say, “Hey, Siri”, it will\nbe the phone’s Siri that activates rather than the HomePod’s.\n\nOn occasion, I suffered real issues casting, too. An iPhone 6S Plus was fine,\nbut around 50% of the time, the HomePod would refuse to play Spotify cast from\nan [iPhone X](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-x). Both phones\nrun the latest version of iOS (11.2.5), so I couldn’t figure out why it would\nwork sometimes, but not others. _(Update: This issue has resolved itself\nfollowing updates to both phone and speaker)_\n\n![HomePod Airplay\nproblem](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe iPhone X shows that it is casting Spotify to the HomePod but no sound is\ncoming out of the speaker\n\nWith regards to requests, you also need to be a lot more specific with Siri\nthan you do with other AI assistants. This becomes frustrating when you still\ndon’t get what you want on your third request.\n\n“Hey Siri, play some nursery rhymes”, I requested on behalf of my son. “I\ncouldn’t find any nursery rhyme songs,” was the response. I tried again: “Hey\nSiri, play some nursery rhyme songs”, changing just one word in my request. On\ncame a great selection of songs for my toddler.\n\n“Hey Siri, play the Doors,” led to a song called ‘Doors’ by an artist I’d\nnever heard of. It was the same when I asked for Massive Attack’s ‘Mezzanine’.\nIt took a couple of tries to get what I wanted. This happened time and time\nagain.\n\nThankfully, Apple Music’s Genius function begins to learn your likes and\ndislikes as soon as you start making requests, so the results get better over\ntime. Not perfect, but better.\n\nGetting the HomePod to work as a smart-home hub also requires very specific\ncommands. Once I’d figured out what I needed to say, the HomePod happily\ncontrolled some of my smart-home devices – but not all of them. HomeKit\ncompatibility remains patchy. If you have older smart-home products then they\nmight not work at all with the HomePod.\n\nAnother issue with Siri on the HomePod is that this is a speaker designed for\nApple households. That means multiple iPhones and iPads. So, on most occasions\nthat I tried to wake up the HomePod with “Hey, Siri,” the iPhones in my house\ndon’t activate, but my iPad always does. This is the sort of usability issue\nApple is generally very good at avoiding.\n\nAnd that’s the crux of the HomePod paradox. It’s the smart speaker to get if\nyou value sound quality, but software grumbles make for a frustrating\nexperience. It made me wish the HomePod was packing Alexa or Google Assistant\ninstead of Siri.\n\nThere’s a good reason why Siri on the HomePod may never become as slick or\nconvenient as Alexa or Google Assistant, and that’s privacy. Unlike the Amazon\nand Google, Apple doesn’t care about your personal data – it doesn’t make\nmoney from it.\n\nThe big question is whether you value privacy over convenience. In my\nexperience, this is rarely the case, but I commend the idea of a smart speaker\nthat doesn’t try to profile you, or use your data in ways you’re not aware of.\n\n## Apple HomePod – Multiroom\n\nUpdate: Apple recently released [iOS\n11.4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ios-11-4-features-3479081) and with\nit Airplay 2. This provides some significant upgrades to the HomePod and makes\nhaving more than one in your house a lot more attractive. Multiroom audio and\nstereo pairing work well.\n\nSetting up a second HomePod is a doddle (as long as you are an iPhone user).\nJust plug it in, tap an iPhone to it and it’ll take all required settings.\n\nTo get your new HomePod to work as a multiroom speaker, or stereo pair, you’ll\nneed to update it to iOS 11.4 or later. Once the HomePod restarts it’s a\nsimple case of opening the Home app and pairing the speakers with a few taps.\n\n![HomePod Stereo pairing\napp](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)I had to tell the Home app which channel was left\nand which was right as it had them the wrong way around to start, but doing\nthis was a simple process.\n\nThe HomePods need to be on same Wi-Fi network to work as a stereo pair, which\nshould be easy enough as they won’t be too far away from each other. That is a\nchallenge if you have a large house and intend to get more than one HomePod\nfor multiroom use.\n\nFor example, if you use a Wi-Fi extenders with their own SSIDs then the\nmultiroom may not work in certain rooms in your house. I use a mesh network,\nwhich essentially extends the same Wi-Fi network across my house so that\ndevices connect automatically to the best signal seamlessly. The HomePods had\nno problems controlling to each other on this network, even at a distance of\nmore than 20m from each other.\n\nApple has made using the HomePod as a multiroom speaker a doddle, as long as\nyou use the Apple Music app, that is.\n\nSiri may not be the smartest AI in town, but its multiroom is slick. Using\nmultiroom is as simple as telling Siri “play this on all speakers”, or “play\nRammstein in the kitchen”. You can volume control, pause and change music from\nany HomePod on your network. Crucially it doesn’t get confused. Summon Siri\nand the speaker that hears you most clearly expects it is the one that’s being\ncommanded.\n\n![HomePod multiroom\nAirplay](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nYou don’t have to use your voice to control HomePods, you can also choose\nmultiple speakers via your iPhone, iPad or Apple TV.\n\nThe only slight annoyance is that you do need to be quite precise in your\nrequests. With two HomePods set up, one in the living room and one in a\nbedroom, I had to be very specific. If I ask “Play this in the living room”\nSiri would reply with “I can’t find that speaker”. “Play this in the main\nliving room”, though, gets results. It’s a small point, but one that shows\nSiri isn’t quite up to the level it needs to be to make it a seamless\nexperience quite yet.\n\nThe Apple TV’s connectivity has also been upgraded with the latest software\nversion. You can now select more than one HomePod to output sound to. If\nyou’ve stereo paired the speakers it will output in stereo, alternatively it\nwill pump out the same audio across devices. This is useful if you want to\nmake some popcorn, but want to keep listening to the movie while doing it.\n\nThe HomePods work as brilliant TV speakers, as long as you use the Apple TV\nfor all your watching needs. You can’t connect your TV to your HomePod without\none.\n\n## Apple HomePod – Stereo Pairing\n\nStereo pairing is a real boon if you have a couple of HomePods near each\nother. Separation is spot on and detail is fantastic. It’s just as comfortable\npumping out Moby’s bass-heavy early works as it is with Miles Davis jazz\nnumbers.\n\nListening to Nirvana Unplugged in New York is a great demonstration of how the\nHomePods manage to keep background noise of clapping and cheers there, but\ndon’t let it muddle or overshadow Cobain’s sensitive vocals.\n\n![HomePod Stereo pair Apple\nTV](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)The HomePod’s already wide soundstage is expanded\nfurther when you combine two together. They can fill a large room more than\nadequately and sound great wherever you’re located. The sweet spots are large\nand I found top volume too loud in the 25m2 room I was testing in. That’s not\na problem I have with a single HomePod.\n\nAnd as with a single HomePod there’s no distortion, such as clipping, even at\nfull blast.\n\n## Why buy the Apple HomePod?\n\nIf you want the slickest smart speaker around, the HomePod isn’t it. But if\nyou’ve totally bought into the Apple ecosystem and value audio quality above\nall, then the HomePod is second to none.\n\nThe price is a stumbling block, however. Add a little more to the HomePod’s\n£319/$349 asking price and you can actually buy two wireless Sonos One smart\nspeakers. Individually they don’t sound as good as the HomePod, but they’re\nnot miles off, and stereo pairing makes them very tempting.\n\nNevertheless, there’s one factor that gives me cause for optimism for the\nfuture of the HomePod. Apple tends to evolve software well after launching a\nnew product. AirPlay 2, which has now been released, enables multiroom and\nstereo pairing. Another example is how far the new Apple TV and the\naccompanying tvOS have come since they launched in 2016.\n\nHowever, as it currently stands, the HomePod is flawed.\n\n## Verdict\n\nThe HomePod sounds so good that I can forgive its price tag, but there are\ncurrently too many usability issues to rate it as a great smart speaker.\n\n## Score\n\n  \n\n"}
