Unfortunately, the mobile\ndevice and 3D printer have to be on the same Wi-Fi network, which limits its\nuse somewhat.\n\nHowever, MakerBot is planning 3G and 4G support, so you can print from\nanywhere in the world. It says it will add the feature “in the near future”.\n\nSo what can you do with the app? You can start printing from your phone and\nmonitor how it’s going using the printer’s built-in camera. Which is handy if\nyou’re working on something else and don’t want to leave the room.\n\nYou can also cancel or pause prints, and change the filament, all without\nleaving your chair.\n\nMakerBot has updated its Thingiverse app too. By using it in tandem with\nMakerBot Mobile, you can print directly from Thingiverse. (For the\nuninitiated, Thingiverse is the online community where people upload their\ndesigns and share what’s new.)\n\n**Read more:** [Red Bull Racing: 3D printing is the future of\nF1](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/red-bull-racing-3d-printing-is-the-\nfuture-of-f1)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n3D printing promised to be the next big thing in gadgets, letting us all make\nour own objects.
