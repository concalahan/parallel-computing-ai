Rather than being just the same product as the US version, the\nThermostat E is rather a redesigned product designed specifically to be easy\nto install in UK homes.**\n\nKey to the product’s ease of installation is the battery-powered Heat Link E.\nRather than having to be wired directly into the boiler, as with the [3rd Gen\nNest Learning Thermostat](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nest-smart-\nthermostat) and its Heat Link, the new product is designed to replace an old\nwired thermostat. You just unscrew the old thermostat and follow the\ninstructions to wire in the Heat Link E and you’re good to go.\n\nAs the Heat Link E will be on display, Nest has made an effort to make it look\ngood. Using a similar grey material covering as the Google Home Mini, the new\nHeat Link E looks great and should fit in with most people’s decor.\n\n![Nest Heat Link\nE](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\n**Related:[Best smart thermostats](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nsmart-thermostats-3431159)**\n\nThe Thermostat E, unlike the US version, is pedestal mounted, and can be\nplugged in anywhere you have a power socket. It has a similar dial action to\nthe Learning Thermostat, letting you twist to turn the temperature up or down.\n\nThe display isn’t as feature-packed as with the Learning Thermostat and can’t,\nfor example, show you the upcoming weather. Instead, the Thermostat E is a\nsimpler product that just shows you the current temperature, with a very\ngentle and soft display. For most people, this is all they need.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nBuilt into the Thermostat E is a temperature sensor, humidity sensor, ambient\nlight sensor (to offset settings should the sun shine directly on it), and an\noccupancy sensor to detect movement and, therefore, turn down the temperature\nwhen nobody is home.\n\nWith the Learning Thermostat it took a period of a few weeks before a schedule\nhad been learned. With the Thermostat E, Nest has taken a different approach,\npre-setting the product with a schedule based on real data from thousands of\nexisting Nest users. The hope is that this schedule will suit most people, and\nthe Thermostat E will adjust over time with use, refining the settings. As for\nhow good this will be, we’ll see when we get our review sample.\n\nAs with the Learning Thermostat, the new product can learn the thermal\nproperties of your home via the True Radiant feature, letting it shut down the\nboiler to prevent temperature overshoot. The Thermostat E uses its integrated\nsensor and the one built into the Heat Link E for this.\n\nAt £199 including VAT, the Thermostat E can be installed my most amateur DIY\nenthusiasts within an hour without the need for a heating engineer. It’s\navailable for pre-order now and we’ll bring you a full review soon.\n\n"}
