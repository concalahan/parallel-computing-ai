The PR sat next to me had told me as I sat down to play, but\nafter several hundred hours with 2016’s Hitman reboot, playing its sequel was\nlike slipping into your favourite dressing gown – warm, cosy and familiar.\n\nThat’s how accidents happen. In 2016’s\n[Hitman](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/hitman), a camera was a\ntickbox — once seen by a camera you would need to make a trip to the security\nroom to erase the tapes or destroy the equipment on the way out. Here, after\ncracking a guard over the head with a brick of cocaine, security cameras are\nrather more dangerous, dispatching guards to my location and raising the alarm\nas I manhandle an unconscious guard off into the shadows.\n\nHitman 2 is very much an iterative revamp of 2016’s rebooted world of\nassassination, but the wealth of new systems in addition to the fact that all\nof the original missions and equipment from the first game will be returning\nfor the second, make this the best the Hitman series has ever been.\n\nIt’s not just security cameras, either. The mirrors in the game are now\nfunctional, and the NPC’s will react if they see you doing something you\nshouldn’t in a mirror. However, you have a few powerful new tools to help you\nmake it through now that the AI and their security have been beefed up: when\nenemies find a body you’re now given a picture-in-picture view of the body,\nand Agent 47 can blend into a crowd to throw off suspicious guards, which is\neasy to do in the race-day crowds of the Miami contract, but tougher to\nachieve in wider, more spacious environments.\n\n**Related:[Best PS4\nGames](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/ps4-games-3431751)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nIO’s soft Hitman reboot was always good at giving you everything you needed to\nsucceed, but it wasn’t always the best at communicating all of its systems to\nyou. Hitman 2, by comparison, gives you all the information you need, but it’s\nshown elegantly – often by taking advantage of a picture-in-picture to show\nyou a found body or pertinent piece of information – and ensures that you’re\nmaking informed decisions.\n\nHitman isn’t a hardcore stealth game, but it’s still best in class for\noffering a sandbox for you to skulk around in, and the consequences it hits\nyou with if you mess up. Failure is fun in Hitman 2, and while I do harbour\nsome regrets about the several times I had to rock and roll, gunning down a\nroom full of armed guards (and a few civilians too, no witnesses) the game\nnever punishes you unfairly. Guards in an area might spot you on sight after\nyour first big shootout, but those patrolling distant areas will be none the\nwiser, even if you’re clad in the same disguise.\n\nPrimarily, my hands-on focused on Colombia and there are several different\nareas. Colombia is close in size to Hitman 2016’s Sapienza, however, the feel\nand vibe is very different and they’re not directly analogous, apart from the\nfact that they feel similarly dense in terms of both things to do and areas to\nexplore. There’s stark contrast between Miami, an earlier shown level where\nplayers are forced to constantly react to a place where things are happening,\nand this sleepy town in Colombia where nothing much is happening and a large\npart of Agent 47’s task is to actually stir the pot to try and create a\nsituation you can take advantage of.\n\n**Related:[Best Gaming Headset](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\ngaming-headsets-3431813) **\n\n![Hitman 2\n](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nHitman, as a franchise, is always at its best when it gives you the time and\nspace to peel back the layers of a level like a big old assassination onion\nand with both of the levels that I’ve played in the new game, you’re free to\ndo just that. Hitman 2 is no longer episodic, meaning you can power through\nall six of the new levels in one sitting if you want, but actually I’d\nrecommend taking your time and learning the intricacies of each mission before\nmoving on to the next.\n\n## First Impressions\n\nHitman’s episodic turn may not have been hugely successful for the company,\nbut it showed the fanbase that the optimal way to play in this collection of\nassassination sandboxes is to digest it slowly, mulling over each individual\nhunt until you’ve mastered it.\n\nWe’ll have more on Hitman later this week, but for now, I feel confident\nsaying that this is a continuation of the stellar work IO put into Hitman, and\nthere’s plenty of reason to be excited about this November launch.\n\n"}
