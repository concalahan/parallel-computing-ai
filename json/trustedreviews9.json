This included the [Fossil Explorist\n2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/fossil-q-explorist) HR and the\n[Skagen Falster 2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/skagen-falster-2).\nBoth of these wearables looked good, but the timing of the announcement felt\nodd, as they were still powered by the ageing and now outdated Snapdragon Wear\n2100 chipset.\n\nQualcomm has now announced and launched the successor to that chipset:\n[Snapdragon Wear 3100](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/montblanc-\nsummit-2-snapdragon-wear-3100-3562444), It promises better battery life,\nimproved always-on functionality and more in-depth workout features. This Wear\n3100 debuts on the Montblanc Summit 2 and during Qualcomm’s 4G/5G Summit in\nHong Kong, I got the chance to try it out.\n\n## Montblanc Summit 2 release date\n\n_You can buy the Montblanc Summit 2 now._\n\n## Montblanc Summit 2 price\n\n_Pricing starts at £849/$995, however, this varies dependant on finish._\n\n**Related:[Best smartwatches](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nsmartwatch)**\n\n![Montblanc Summit\n2](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nAs the £849 price makes perfectly clear, this isn’t a watch for everyone. This\nis a high-end wearable that pairs a luxurious look with a designer label. It\nalso has a well-rounded spec list with GPS, 5ATM water resistance rating and\nNFC for [Google Pay](https://www.trustedreviews.com/how-to/how-to-use-google-\npay-3521528) – a feature sorely lacking on the previous\n[Summit](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/montblanc-summit).\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nInstead of focusing on performance, the Wear 3100 chipset is mainly about\nbattery life. For the Summit 2, Montblanc is claiming you’ll get over a day’s\nuse out of the battery, with that being stretched out to a week if you enter\nthe Traditional Watch Mode. It’s that latter mode that’s interesting as it\nutilises the new low-power co-processor inside the 3100 to extend endurance.\n\nThe Summit 2 also uses the updated Wear OS software which is currently rolling\nout to older devices. This spruces up the UI, making it easier to see your\nGoogle Fit stats and easier to launch Google Pay. It’s a big upgrade on what\nwas a very tired experience previously, especially when compared with watchOS\non the excellent [Apple Watch 4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/apple-\nwatch-4).\n\n![Montblanc Summit\n2](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nThere will likely be a whole load of other Wear 3100 watches hitting shelves\nin the coming months, so the real reason to pick up the Summit 2 is for its\ndesign.\n\nI’m not normally a fan of smartwatches that try desperately to look like\nregular timepieces (the [Huawei Watch\nGT](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/huawei-watch-gt) being a fine\nexample) but this one works really well. The 42mm size is on the smaller side\nand the watch sits close to the wrist. You can pick up it in various metal\nfinishes, including stainless steel and titanium, and there are different\nstrap options too. The version I tried had a buckled leather strap that felt\nsoft and luxurious.\n\nThis premium finish extends to the 1.2-inch OLED display too, which is covered\nin sapphire crystal for improved scratch resistance.\n\n## **Opening impressions**\n\nThe promise of watches powered by Qualcomm’s Wear 3100 is great, especially\nthe improvements to battery life, however, the high price of the Summit 2\nmeans it’s only for those who really want that luxurious finish and a designer\nlabel.\n\nIt doesn’t necessarily do anything other watches running this chipset won’t be\nable to do, but it does look and feel great.\n\n"}
