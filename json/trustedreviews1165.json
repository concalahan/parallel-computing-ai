Firstly, you’ll want to\nunlock all sections of the map and some slightly harder to find gongs at the\npeak of each respective tower. This might cost a few points, so don’t expect\nto uncover everything until after a few rounds.\n\nUpon the ringing of each gong, a champion will appear for you to defeat. These\nare difficult enemies who happily soak up hundreds of bullets before biting\nthe dust. After they’re down for the count, head over to the corpse and pick\nup the item they’ve dropped.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nWith this item in hand, head over to each champion’s respective section of the\nmap and jam it into their altar.

IX is no exception, containing a mystery box which\nwill change location as you progress.\n\nIt always starts off underground in the ominous catacombs. More specifically,\nit’s in one of the first underground areas you’ll unlock after abandoning the\nmain arena in the early goings. Head to the upper-right corner and open the\ngate, slaying undead as you go. After this, keep an eye out for a mystery box\nnear a fractured statue.\n\nIn the starting area, all gates around you will be locked and require a\ngenerous amount of points to be unlocked. Some won’t need points, instead\nbeing opened from the other side or requiring a specific artifact.\n\n**Related:[Best Gaming Keyboards](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\ngaming-keyboard-3500376)**\n\n![Black Ops 4 IX Tips and\nTricks](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Call of Duty Black Ops 4 IX Guide – How to build the Zombie Shield\n\nYou can build a Zombie Shield in each of the Black Ops 4 zombie mode maps\ncurrently in the game. It’s a powerful means of defense and requires quite a\nfew ingredients to construct. We’ve compiled a step-by-step guide for each of\nthem below.\n\n**Blade – Step 1:** The first piece can be found in the Altar Room. To be more\nspecific, look behind the stairs and on the statue pedestal.\n\n**Blade – Step 2:** Next up you’ll need to hit up the entrance to Zeus Tower\nin search of the second piece. You’ll find it at the base of the statue near\nthe Altar Room.\n\n**Blade – Step 3:** Zeus Tower once again, except this time you’ll be getting\na little moist in the bathhouse. Not too wet though, as it’s waiting just by\nthe entrance.\n\n**Related:**[ **Best Gaming Mouse**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\ngaming-mouse-3515423)\n\n![Black Ops 4 IX Tips and\nTricks](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nNext up is the shield itself, which is also split into three individual parts\nyou can find throughout the map. All three of these are located in the Ra\nAltar Room which is nice and convenient.\n\n**Shield – Step 1:** Look around in the corners, it will be waiting for you\nnear one of the pillars.\n\n**Shield – Step 2:** It’s left of the gong, which is a pretty obvious thing to\nspot inside the room itself.\n\n**Shield – Step 3:** This one is right of the aforementioned gong, sitting\nagainst the wall.\n\nFinally, you’ll need to venture around the coliseum in search of the Buckler\nwhich is, of course, split into three different parts. All of these can be\nfound in the Odin Tower.\n\n**Buckler – Step 1:** Awaiting you in the entrance, this part can be found\nhiding nearby a shield-rack in the corner.\n\n**Bucker – Step 2:** Located in the Tower Cauldron, you’ll find it near some\nmounted objects on the wall.\n\n**Buckler – Step 3:** In the Altar Room Glance to the right of the stairs and\nyou’ll see it being stored alongside a couple of spears.\n\nOnce all the parts are collected, all you need to do is find a workbench and\nconstruct it. After that, it’ll be waiting in your inventory.\n\n## Call of Duty Black Ops 4 IX Guide – How to complete Arena Challenges\n\nIX has a series of challenges that can be dished out to a limited amount of\nplayers, resulting in additional experience, equipment and stepping stones to\na few delightful easter eggs and legendary weapons.\n\nTo activate said challenges you’ll need to cut one of the multiple ropes\nlocated at the outer wall of the arena.
