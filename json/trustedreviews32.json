The[Android 5.0\nLollipop](https://www.trustedreviews.com/android-5-0-lollipop-review) rollout\nhas just kicked off in Europe.**\n\nThe software upgrade is only available in Poland for now, but this means it’s\nready to land on [Samsung Galaxy S5](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-\ngalaxy-s5-review) devices across the board at the very least.\n\nAlthough Android Lollipop launched around two months ago, it typically doesn’t\nmake it to Samsung devices until later because the firm tinkers with the code\nfirst.\n\nSamsung’s Android variant is called\n[TouchWiz](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-s5-review-\nandroid-4-4-software-touchwiz-page-3), and now seems to be officially complete\nand ready to rollout worldwide.\n\nIt’s still not clear when the US will get the S5 Lollipop update, because\ntransatlantic carrier certification needs to take place.\n\nIt’s fairly impressive that Samsung managed such a quick turnaround for its\nown Android ROM – Google only unveiled its [Lollipop source\ncode](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-outs-android-5-0-lollipop-\nsource-code) via AOSP on November 4.\n\nLollipop brings with it a raft of software-borne goodies, including 64-bit\nchip support, boosted battery life, improved cross-platform functionality, and\na ‘material design’ aesthetic overhaul.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nIt also adds lockscreen notifications, double-tap to wake, Smart Lock, and\nMirrorLink.\n\nSamsung’s also built in its own clipboard feature – good for compiling your\nscreenshots and copied text.\n\nA common complaint of TouchWiz in the past was that it felt slightly bloated\nand cumbersome, but the new Lollipop changes should see performance\nimprovements across the board.\n\nThere’s no telling when Lollipop will land in the UK, but it’s encouraging to\nhear that it’s made it to the continent.\n\n**Read More:** [Samsung Galaxy S6 release\ndate](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s6-release-date-\nrumours-news-specs-and-price)\n\n**Via:** [Sammobile](http://www.sammobile.com/2014/12/04/samsung-\ngalaxy-s5-sm-g900f-receives-android-5-0-lollipop-update/)\n\n"}
