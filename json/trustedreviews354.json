The show is hosted by Jeremy Clarkson, Richard\nHammond and James May after the trio departed the BBC’s flagship car program\nTop Gear.\n\nNo video game has ever really tried to keep pace with a television show\nbefore, ignoring experiments like Defiance, which served up a game and TV\nseries in the same universe but didn’t attempt synchronicity. The new content\nwill take the form of challenges based upon the series, meaning that if\nClarkson and his pals drive a supercar, you’ll drive a supercar. If they\ninstead, say, drag race forklift trucks… it’s time to start working on your\nforklift license.\n\n**Related:[Best Racing Games ](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nracing-games)**\n\nTying these challenges together are video segments from the show and original\nvoice work from the three presenters. Honestly, as a concept, this is one of\nthe most innovative things I’ve seen at Gamescom.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nUnfortunately, the build I saw is pretty bad.\n\n## **(Bad) Quantum Break with BMW’s**\n\nThe Grand Tour The Game is bad in two different ways. On a technical level,\nthe game – which in fairness is still very early access – is technically bad.\nCars handle weirdly, the game looks aged, and the physics are bizarre. In the\ngame’s four-player split-screen multiplayer, our playtest devolved into four\nplayers crashing into each other like bumper cars. The entire race was a farce\nof cars spinning and turning as they crumpled into each other.\n\nThe single player experience was also lacking somewhat. I played three\nsegments inspired by the first episode of The Grand Tour, including a race\nagainst May and Hammond through the desert, a time trial and, last and by all\nmeans least, a segment where I had to stop Hammond crapping his pants. I\nearned a single poo emoji – seriously – each time I left the road or bumped\ninto something. Hammond would let out a canned Bark talking about how he’d\npooed in a variety of ways with every mistake.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThere were no time restraints, meaning technically the way to be most\nsuccessful at the game was to keep the car going forwards at a crawl and nudge\nmy way to the finish line.\n\nI didn’t do that of course, razzing it around the track like a teenager in a\nHalfords car-park. Perhaps I was just distracted by the whole poo thing. I got\nsix poo emojis.\n\n## **Six Poo Emojis**\n\nThe second way the game is bad is the certain type of nonsensical misanthropy\nthat runs at the core of The Grand Tour. If you’re a fan of the show, this\nwon’t grate on you, but there’s something about the forced banter that seeps\ninto every part of the game that leaves me cold. Yes, the poo thing again, but\nthere’s also the way that one of the multiplayer power-ups in the game is\ncalled Texting, where you send a _hilarious_ text to any nearby drivers that\nfills their screen and forces them to crash. These sort of thing is probably\namusing to fans of The Grand Tour, but if you’re a fan of games, you can do\nbetter.\n\nThis feels like a cynical cash-in, and while I want the concept to succeed,\nit’s a tough sell to ask punters to buy into the game solely to drive similar\nchallenges to the one’s airing on The Grand Tour each week. From what I’ve\nseen it’s not worth playing this game only to hear Clarkson scream a few voice\nlines every time the terrible handling tosses you into a hedge.\n\nThe game isn’t finished yet, and this early build may not be indicative of the\nfinal quality, but at the moment there’s an excellent concept here that has\nabsolutely no other redeeming features.\n\nThe Grand Tour will launch on PS4 and Xbox One at an unspecified point in the\nfuture.\n\n**Do you like The Grand Tour enough to give its tie-in game a shot?
