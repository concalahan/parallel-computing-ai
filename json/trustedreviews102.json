But it doesn’t come cheap, setting buyers back a ludicrous\n$4,999 (£3,800+). Fortunately, most of that cost can be sourced to the six\nGoPro Hero4 Black cameras bundled with the rig. If you already have six of\nthose cameras, then you can pick up the standalone rig for a less painful\n$1,499 (£1,150).\n\nSo what actually is the Omni? It’s basically a six-camera capture rig that\nlets you create 360-degree spherical content for virtual reality platforms. At\nits price, you’d only expect buyers to include professional filmmakers and\nenthusiastic hobbyists. But hey, maybe if you’ve got a spare four grand in the\ncoffers, an Omni could be yours.\n\nBut let’s be fair, you get a little more than just a camera system, as GoPro\nexplains:\n\n“Omni is so much more than just a six-camera capture rig designed for GoPro\ncameras. Omni is an end-to-end content creation ecosystem that, by\naccelerating the time from capture to publish, will allow content creators to\ncapture and publish more, higher-quality content.”\n\nWhat does that actually mean? Well, the hardware is pretty powerful, for a\nstart. You’re getting perks like pixel-level synchronisation for clean\nstitching, error-proof shooting, heat dissipation, versatile power options\n(external battery pack, for instance), durable, modular parts, and impressive\nmetadata/SD card management.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThe rig also comes with GoPro’s custom-built Omni Importer software, which\nmakes it easy to preview, stitch, and publish content that you’ve filmed on\nthe Omni. Just plug your SD cards into your USB hub, and the Omni importer\ndoes the rest. Its features include instant stitch previews, shot renaming,\nshot trimming, colour correction, stabilisation, and plenty more.\n\nSounds great right? Better start checking down the back of the sofa for spare\nchange…\n\n**Related:[Best Camera 2016](https://www.trustedreviews.com/top-ten-\ncameras_round-up)**\n\n**Watch The Refresh: The best tech gossip and reviews every week**\n\n**Will you be putting the Omni rig on your Christmas list?
