However, despite Fallout 76 coming to the Xbox One, PS4\nand PC, Bethesda have said it “wasn’t doable” to bring the upcoming\nmultiplayer Fallout to Ninty’s flagship.\n\nThe news came during a panel at PAX Aus, reported by\n[Gamespot](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-for-nintendo-switch-\nwasnt-doable-but-be/1100-6462843/), where Bethesda marketing executive Pete\nHines claimed a Switch version wasn’t possible, although Bethesda had\ninitially considered it.\n\nDuring the panel, Hines claimed Nintendo’s handheld “is part of every\nconversation with dev we have now about what we’re doing going forward because\nwe consider it to be a viable platform.”\n\n**Related:[Best Gaming Mouse](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-gaming-\nmouse-3515423)**\n\nRegarding the company’s push towards the Switch, Hines said: “I enjoy us being\nseen as the third-party leader in terms of supporting Switch. People go, ‘Hey,\nyou’ve got a lot more stuff [on Switch] than this publisher or that\npublisher.’ That’s what I want Bethesda to be known as. We’re guys who will\ntake some risks.”\n\nWhile their status as the third-party leader for Switch support is very much\nunconfirmed at this point, the fact the studio is thinking fondly of the\nhandheld is exciting to hear about for Nintendo Switch owners. The studio’s\nnext Wolfenstein title is planned for the Nintendo Switch, and while Fallout\n76 isn’t coming, this isn’t a bad omen for Switch support in general. Bethesda\nare still flying the flag.  \n  \n[Fallout 76](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/fallout-76) releases on\nNovember 14th.\n\n"}
