This has the potential to hinder multi-tasking and frequent app-switching.The other big difference between the majority of Samsung’s 2017 flagships andits 2018 devices – including the new Note 9 – is the newer phones’ dual rearcamera setup.The 12-megapixel single sensor on the rear of the S8 Plus is still undeniablyexcellent. However, Samsung’s camera technicians never rest on their laurels,gracing the Note 9 with a souped-up mix of the dual 12-megapixel setup firstencountered on the Note 8 with the dual aperture magic that debuted on the S9.Albeit, this time with a fingerprint sensor in a more convenient position –another trait lacking in the S8 Plus.**Related:[Samsung Galaxy Note 9 vs GalaxyS9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-9-vs-galaxy-s9-3527010)**## Samsung Galaxy Note 9 vs Galaxy S8 Plus – SpecsHere’s a rundown of some of the fundamentals at play within both the newGalaxy Note 9 and Samsung’s Galaxy S8 Plus:**Price** £899/£1099£699 (64GB)| **Galaxy Note 9** | **Galaxy S8 Plus**  ---|---|---  **Display** |  6.4 inches,  1440 x 2960, AMOLED | 6.2 inches, 1440 x 2960, AMOLED  **Processor** |  Exynos 9810/Snapdragon 845 | Exynos 8895/Snapdragon 835  **RAM** |  6GB/8GB | 4GB/6GB  **Rear camera** |  Dual 12-megapixel | Single 12-megapixel  **Front camera** |  8-megapixel | 8-megapixel  **Battery** |  4000mAh | 3500mAh  **Software** |  Android 8.1 Oreo | Android 8.0 Oreo  **Storage** |  128/512GB + microSD up to 512GB | 64/128GB w/ microSD up to512GB  **Stylus** |  S Pen w/ Bluetooth | None    ## Samsung Galaxy Note 9 vs Galaxy S8 Plus – Design and softwareThe Note series has always sported a more square appearance than thecurvacious Galaxy S line, and the same is true here. The Note 9, like the S8Plus, is a sandwich of curved Gorilla Glass on the front and back, with ametal frame running around the phone’s edge.The rounding of the corners on the Note’s body and display are bothsignificantly smaller than the S8 Plus’ silhouette – which, if it’s anythinglike the Note 8, will make it a touch less ergonomic.Samsung now colour-matches the glass and metalwork on 2018’s Note, while theS8 Plus comes in all-black or a silver frame when paired with any othercolourway. The predominantly glass design does at least facilitate bothphone’s wireless and fast-charging support, which has now become a staple ofSamsung’s flagship devices.As for the software experience, both phones sport heavily skinned butrelatively slick variations on Android, dubbed the Samsung Experience. Runningatop 8.0 Oreo (with an update to 8.1 Oreo slated for later in August) on theS8 Plus and Android 8.1 Oreo at launch on the Note 9, with a presumed updateto [Android 9.0 Pie](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/android-pie)sometime next spring, the Samsung Experience 9.0 is decidedly similar on bothphones.**Related:[Samsung Galaxy Note 9 vs iPhoneX](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-9-vs-iphone-x-3527113)**There’s native support for multi-tasking, Bixby is unfortunately just abutton-press or a swipe away, and Samsung’s pre-loaded software – such as itsThemes app, Health app and Edge Screen – are all present and correct on both.Being a Note rather than a Galaxy S device, Samsung also throws in a fewstylus-driven experiences on the Note 9. These include Samsung Notes, thePENUP illustrative social network and Air Command, which lets you takesnippets, draw animated live messages and use the S Pen to request real-timetext translation.## Samsung Galaxy Note 9 vs Galaxy S8 Plus price – Which is better value?The Samsung Galaxy Note 9 is the company’s productivity-driven flagship for2018, whereas the Galaxy S line has always had a proclivity for entertainment.Last year’s S8 Plus will continue to deliver a sterling smartphone experienceand is still receiving major Android updates from Samsung, so should remainrelevant for at least another year. The Note 9, meanwhile, is essentially thebest of Samsung’s best right now and, as such, comes with a price tag tomatch, starting at £899.* * *## Note 9 Pre-order contracts**Sky Mobile** – 2GB of data: [Galaxy Note 9 128GB – no upfront,£42/month](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=11005&clickref=tr-note9&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sky.com%2Fshop%2Fmobile)**Three** – 4GB of data: [Galaxy Note 9 128GB – £79 upfront,£48/month](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=10210&clickref=tr-note9&p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.three.co.uk%2F)**EE** – 8GB of data: [Galaxy Note 9 128GB – £150 upfront,£48/month](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=tr-note9&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fsamsung-galaxy-note-9-128GB-midnight-black%3Ftariffcode%3DBG4YMFEB18)**Vodafone** – 40GB of data: [Galaxy Note 9 128GB – £66 upfront,£49/month](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=1257&clickref=tr-note9&p=http%3A%2F%2Fshop.vodafone.co.uk%2Fshop%2Fcontracts-and-deals%2Fsamsung-galaxy-note-9%2Fsku94702)**Virgin Mobile** – 5GB of data, 1000 minutes, unlimited texts: [Galaxy Note 9128GB – no upfront,£55.50/month](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=6399&clickref=tr-note9&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.virginmedia.com%2Fmobile%2Fpay-monthly%2Fsamsung%2Fgalaxy-note-9%2F%3FcontractDuration%3D24%26tariffID%3D1174810128)**EE** – 30GB of data: [Galaxy Note 9 128GB – £59.99 upfront,£68/month](https://www.carphonewarehouse.com/mobiles/pay-monthly-tariff.html#!/sort/relevance/model/SAMNOTE9128BLA)* * *## Early verdictIf you want the S Pen functionality, better battery life, an even largerdisplay and a more versatile camera, then the Note 9 is the way to go – butyou’ll pay through the nose for it at launch.The S8 Plus will continue to serve you well for media and gaming on a big-screened phone, and it’s dropped in price considerably. If you’re stillhankering for stylus input, the Note 8 has also seen a reduction in price andwill likely drop further, faster once the phone hits stores.**Related:[Samsung Galaxy Note 9 vs Galaxy S9Plus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-9-vs-galaxy-s9-plus-3525284)**"}
