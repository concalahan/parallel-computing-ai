Since then it’s been sold on to Lenovo, which hasused the brand to release a stunning lineup of budget smartphones under theMoto branding (most recently the [MotoG6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/moto-g6)).But the legacy of the Razr has always been keenly felt by the company. Back in2016 it released a trailer featuring the iconic clamshell phone, but itappears that nothing came from the firm’s promise to “Flip back to the Razrdays of yesteryear and get ready for the future.”We’d love to see the Razr make an official branded comeback, and if Lenovo canget a folding screen integrated then we’ll have a reason to take a seriouslook at it beyond nostalgia.**Would you like to see the Razr make a comeback?
