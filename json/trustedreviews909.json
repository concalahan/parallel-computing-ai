Fornite’s glowing cube has just exploded in a reality-\naltering cataclysm.\n\nIn the video below, captured by yours truly, you’ll be able to witness how the\nin-game event went down. The short version is anyone in a match at 6PM UK time\nwas treated to a surprise.\n\n> WHAT THE HELL JUST HAPPENED?!?!\n[#Fortnite](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fortnite?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n[#PS4share](https://twitter.com/hashtag/PS4share?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)<https://t.co/X4eLN4XHyj>\n[pic.twitter.com/f1Abu6ZJYh](https://t.co/f1Abu6ZJYh)\n\n>\n\n> — Wesley Copeland (@Wesley_Copeland) [November 4,\n2018](https://twitter.com/Wesley_Copeland/status/1059151527531741185?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nThe cube violently spun until it exploded with an all-consuming light. The\nlight that emanated appears to be a rift, which transported players into a\nPhoenix-like white hot room. An ethereal butterfly then appeared and led all\nof the remaining players back to the real (virtual) world to reveal Leaky Lake\nhas now been terraformed into something quite beautiful.\n\nIt’s hard to gauge how this will affect the rest of season 6, or if it will\ntie into season 7. Does the butterfly mark the end of the cube monsters? Has a\nspirit butterfly saved us all? Only time will tell.\n\n**Related:[Best Nintendo Switch\nGames](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/nintendo-switch-games-3435122)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThis isn’t the first time Epic has danced with in-game events. Just a few\nseasons ago saw a rocket launch that threatened to destroy Titled Towers\nbefore veering off towards Dust Depot, leaving nothing but a massive crater\nand a lot of, then, unanswered questions.\n\nAs always, if you’re a keen Fortnite player with a completionist nature, we’ve\ngot guides to help out with each of season 6’s weekly challenges.
