Senior developer Todd\nHoward promised that the game would be coming after\n‘[Starfield](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/starfield-release-\ndate-3484396)‘, which is intended as a next-generation title. So don’t expect\nit before 2021 at the earliest.\n\n_Trusted Reviews_ has put together the small amount we know about the upcoming\ngame, and have also put together a list of the features we’d love to see from\nThe Elder Scrolls 6.\n\n* * *\n\n**Buy The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim from[Amazon UK](http://amzn.to/2CeriOF) |\n[Amazon.com](http://amzn.to/2omffq1)**\n\n* * *\n\n**Related:[PS5 wishlist](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ps5-release-date-\nprice-games-news-rumours-specs-2993694)**\n\n_![skyrim](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)_\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n## What is The Elder Scrolls 6?\n\nCurrently lacking a catchy subtitle, The Elder Scrolls 6 is the next entry in\nthe beloved open-world RPG franchise and is being developed by Bethesda\nSoftworks.\n\n## The Elder Scrolls 6 release date – When is it coming out?\n\nE3 2018 gave us our first hints as to when we might finally get to see this\nlong-awaited game. After showing off a teaser trailer for ‘Starfield’ — which\nBethesda introduced as a next-generation title — senior developer Todd Howard\nthen introduced TES6 as the game Bethesda would go on to produce after it.\n\nThat puts Elder Scrolls 6 firmly into next generation territory, suggesting\nthat we won’t see it until at least 2021, if not later.\n\n## The Elder Scrolls 6 trailer – Get a first look at the game\n\nIt’s not much, but E3 2018 gave us our first glimpse at The Elder Scrolls 6.\nYou can watch the teaser trailer below, but don’t get your hopes up too much.\n\n**Related** **:[Call of Duty Black Ops 4 latest\nnews](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-4-3373836)**\n\n## The Elder Scrolls 6 – 5 things we’d like to see\n\n**More variety in the open world**\n\nSkyrim was proper lovely, but had a bit too much of the white stuff going\naround. Venturing across a snowy, uncompromising landscape was thrilling at\nfirst, but lacked in worthwhile variety the further you pushed forward. Every\ncave, mountain and bandit encampment felt the same, albeit with a few unique\ntreasures and trinkets lying about for the taking. Even\n[Oblivion](https://www.trustedreviews.com/The-Elder-Scrolls-IV-Oblivion-\nreview) felt more distinctive, and it came out almost six years earlier.\n\nThe setting of Elder Scrolls 6 is still unconfirmed, but we’d love for it to\nincorporate a generous palette of varied locations, visual motifs and weather\nsystems. This could be achieved by giving the player different regions to\nexplore, each with their own individual identity. This is a tall order, but\none that would make the world of Elders Scroll 6 all the more memorable.  \n**  \nChallenging and meaningful combat**\n\nCombat in previous Elder Scrolls titles was merely a case of mashing the\nshoulder buttons as quickly as possible until the enemies hounding you dropped\nto the floor. It was serviceable yet undeniably simplistic in its execution.\nFocus was placed on the discovery of abilities and weapons instead of the way\nin which they were used.  \n**  \nRelated:[Best RPGs](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-rpg)**\n\n![skyrim](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe Elder Scrolls 6 needs to completely overhaul this, crafting a combat\nsystem that focuses on deliberate strategy rather than artificial difficulty\ndetermined by the number of nasties on screen and how much health they\npossess. Imagine setting a bandit aflame, causing him to jump into the water\nout of painful desperation. You could charge in and finish him off with a\nwell-timed sword slash or cast a lightning spell for a slower, more agonizing\ndeath.\n\nThe use of weapon augmentations and splicing together different spells would\nbe another wonderful addition, providing layers of customization that has\nsorely been missed from the combat of Elder Scrolls. Every single weapon and\nspell you equip has a one-of-a-kind aesthetic, but they all the feel exactly\nthe same when used in combat. The lack of satisfactory impact is hard to\nignore after dozens of hours of playtime.\n\n**Distinct gameplay styles**\n\nThe basic framework of Skyrim and Oblivion allowed for several different\ngameplay styles. You could be a chivalrous knight or a mysterious ninja,\napproaching characters and questlines perfectly suited to your otherworldly\npersona. The vast selection of races and classes made this all the better,\ngiving you a broad range of skills and abilities to pursue as you levelled up.\nIt still works brilliantly today, although a few subtle refinements would make\nit all the better.\n\n**Related:[Spider-Man PS4 latest\nnews](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/spider-man-ps4-release-date-trailer-\ngameplay-pre-order)**\n\n![skyrim](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nBeing able to approach major questlines from multiple different directions\nwould be fantastic, especially if it mimicked the open-ended nature of titles\nsuch as [Deus Ex: Mankind Divided](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deus-ex-\nmankind-divided-review) and [Far Cry](https://www.trustedreviews.com/far-cry-\nprimal-review). We’re in a vast fantasy world filled with morally diverse\ncharacters and factions, so why shouldn’t our actions reflect our personal\ninterests in the matter. Taking down a corrupt king? You could assassinate\nhim, launch an obvious assault of just sit down for a chat. Bethesda has shown\nits talent for diverse gameplay systems in the past, and here they could push\nthem to the limit.\n\n**Intelligent AI**\n\nHave you ever randomly been shot in the chest with an arrow, only to ignore it\nand move on with your day. Guards in Skyrim have. Artificial intelligence in\nBethesda games has always been notoriously silly, bordering on stupid at\ntimes. You could loot an entire house or throw a grenade into a settlement\nonly to leave the area and have all your tribulations forgiven. Seldom did\nyour actions in the bustling world you occupy ever have any lasting\nconsequences.\n\n**Related:[Xbox One X](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/xbox-one-x-\npreorder-specs-price-release-date-2993238)**\n\n![skyrim](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe Elder Scrolls 6 could improve this maligned feature by adding subtle\nimprovements to NPC routines and the way in which they react to your presence.\nIf you’re an infamous killer they should recoil in fear as you prowl the town,\nlooting shops and murdering beggars. On the flipside, a courageous hero should\nbe showered with gifts and compliments as they perform yet another brave deed.\n\nAll I’m saying is I don’t want children to stare at me innocently after I’ve\njust decorated the upholstery with their parents.  \n**  \nBetter guilds and side quests**\n\nIn many ways, the guild questlines in Skyrim felt like a step back from\nprevious games. They lacked the distinctive characters and narrative depth of\nMorrowind and Oblivion, opting instead for smaller, less ambitious ventures\nthat didn’t feel nearly as engrossing. We’d love for Bethesda to overhaul the\nguild system in its next game, giving us a wider selection of factions to\nchoose from across the vast lands we explore. These could easily reflect our\nmoral standing within the world, as well as providing us with a platform to\nexperiment with different playstyles.\n\n**Related:[Upcoming Xbox One\nGames](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/upcoming-xbox-one-games)**\n\n![skyrim](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe Elder Scrolls 6 would also benefit from a handful of truly memorable\nsidequests, giving players further incentive to abandon the main quest and\nrandom exploration that drove previous games. Disputes between rival factions\nand cities would provide the perfect backdrop for a seriously intense\nsidequest, complimented by new characters and motivations you can’t help but\ncare for. Many of the miscellaneous quests in Skyrim bled into one another,\nlacking a sense of cohesion or uniqueness beyond their somewhat varying\nlocations.\n\n**Buy The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim from[Amazon UK](http://amzn.to/2CeriOF) |\n[Amazon.com](http://amzn.to/2omffq1)**\n\n_**The Elder Scrolls 6 may be a long way off, but what would you like to see?\nLet us know on Twitter and Facebook!**_\n\n"}
