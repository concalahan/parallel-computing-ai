This handset is\nvery different from every other Android phone out there for the simple reason\nthat it has a physical keyboard.\n\nThis immediately makes it an odd device. If you’re used to interacting with a\nphone purely via the touchscreen then being forced back to a physical keyboard\nis almost an unnatural experience. But if you were a fan of the KeyOne, or\nstill harbour a desire to knock out all your emails with a physical board,\nthen this device could be for you.\n\n## **BlackBerry Key2 – Design**\n\nThe KeyOne was a brute of a phone: thick, heavy and tough to hold. With the\nKey2, BlackBerry Mobile has put the device on a diet and given it a much-\nneeded makeover. It’s slimmer, lighter and less intimidating than before, but\nwithout losing that classic BlackBerry identity.\n\n**Related:[Best Android phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nandroid-phones-3438996)**\n\n![blackberry\nkey2](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe body of the Key2 is less curved, instead sporting sharper lines and\ncorners. The flat sides make it easy to hold and the reduction in weight is\nmost welcome – it just feels far more comfortable in the hand.\n\nOn the rear BlackBerry sticks with the rubbery plastic covering, rather than\nswitching to a much less durable glass coating of the type seen on the\nmajority of flagship phones in 2018. This is fitting with the message that\nBlackBerry is trying to convey here; this device isn’t flashy; it’s\nfunctional.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nThe Key2 isn’t going to trouble the [iPhone\nX](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-x) or [Galaxy\nS9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9) for design\nawards – in my opinion, anyway – but that isn’t really the point of this\ndevice.\n\nThe Key2 lacks a water-resistance rating, so you won’t be knocking out an\nemail during your morning shower. However, I won’t criticise BlackBerry too\nferociously here: I was told during the launch of the Key2 that adding any\nsort of IP-rating to a device with a keyboard this intricate was currently\nvery difficult.\n\n![blackberry\nkey2](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe keyboard clearly is the star of the show in the Key2, and it’s a huge\nimprovement over the KeyOne. The keys are 20% larger, have a much gripper\nmatte-coating rather than a glossy one and in general feel far nicer to type\non.\n\nWhether or not you prefer a real keyboard over a virtual one will be a matter\nof personal preference. Personally, I type noticeably quicker with a software\nkeyboard; jumping back to the Key2 certainly slowed me down. I made many more\nmistakes whilst typing, too.\n\nStill, if you’re looking at the Key2 then you’ll probably already know that it\nworks for you. This keyboard is very much a job well done, but it definitely\nwon’t be for everyone.\n\nA new button features on the keyboard, which BlackBerry has dubbed the speed\nkey. Press it alongside a letter key and you can easily jump between apps. For\ninstance, if you set the ‘S’ key to open Spotify, then pressing the speed key\nfollowed by ‘S’ will open the app.\n\nIt’s possible to set a different shortcut to each key, so if you frequent\nMaps, Instagram, Twitter and Gmail then you can jump between all of them\nwithout going back to the homescreen. Shortcuts have always been a staple of\nthe BlackBerry series and if you’re willing to put the time in to learn and\ncustomise them then they’ll prove super-useful.\n\n![blackberry\nkey2](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe Key2, like the KeyOne before it, features gesture control built into the\nkeyboard. This lets you scroll up and down and side-to-side without reaching\nup to the display. It’s a nice touch and one that becomes seriously useful\nonce you become familiar with the phone.\n\nThere remain some quirks, though. Often, the swipe gestures just won’t\nregister. It isn’t something that happens every time, but it’s frustrating\nwhen it does.\n\nThe usefulness of this feature also makes some of device’s shortcomings even\nmore obvious. Having to constantly switch between the keyboard and display for\ninput is a pain, even when you’re scrolling around with gestures. I’d love\nthere to be someway to select an item without having to remove my fingers from\nthe keys.\n\nThis is hindered further by the Key2 being a fairly sizeable phone – more\ncomparable to the OnePlus 6 or Note 8 than an iPhone or ‘classic’ BlackBerry –\nso moving your finger between the keyboard and something at the top of the\ndisplay requires a stretch.\n\nBlackBerry sticks with the headphone jack (I’d much rather it was located\nalong the bottom edge rather than the top, however) and, thankfully, it’s\nshunted all the side-keys onto the right-hand side.\n\nThe KeyOne’s power switch was positioned on the left. This was odd, especially\nwith the user-configurable shortcut button present too. That button remains,\nand it’s handy that it doesn’t force you to use it for just one thing – like\nthe Bixby button on the Galaxy S9.\n\n## **BlackBerry Key2 – Screen**\n\nThe Key2’s 4.5-inch 1080 x 1620 display is pretty much identical to the one in\nthe KeyOne. It’s a nice, sharp and bright display with decent colour\nreproduction and excellent viewing angles. Black levels are good, too, even\nthough this is an LCD screen rather than OLED.\n\nDue to the fact that the keyboard sits below the screen, this phone is very\nmuch made to be used in portrait mode. This isn’t a device for watching\nYouTube videos in landscape and the experience of doing so is poor. That’s to\nbe expected, but it’s still worth noting.\n\n**Related:[Best VPNs](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-vpn-3470328)**\n\n![blackberry\nkey2](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nBelow the screen is the usual array of three Android navigation keys. Instead\nof being on the screen as they are in majority of other Android phones,\nthey’re physical capacitive keys that light up when required.\n\nI find this a slightly strange design choice and one that wastes a good deal\nof space. It also means you’ll be forced to always use the same keys, even\nwhen they appear to be changing in the upcoming Android P update.\n\n## **BlackBerry Key2 – Performance**\n\nEven though the BlackBerry Mobile Key2 retails for a price (£599) that I’d\nnormally associate with high-end devices, the internals are far similar to\nwhat you’d find at the heart of a mid-range phone.\n\nUnlike the Snapdragon 845 you’ll find in the OnePlus 6 and LG G7 (two phones\nat a similar/cheaper price), the Key2 is home to a Snapdragon 660. Alongside\nis 6GB of RAM – a nice bump up from the 3GB in the KeyOne – and a starting\n64GB of storage.\n\nI’m happy that BlackBerry decided against raising the price significantly,\ninstead sticking with a very capable processor that isn’t quite as power-\nhungry. The Key2 feels super-fast in everyday use, and for the tasks for which\nthis phone is built for, including an 845 chip would be overkill.\n\nSwitching between apps using the the speed key is instantaneous and, clearly,\nBlackBerry Mobile has optimised the software well.\n\nThe Key2 isn’t the best phone for gaming, in the main due to the keyboard’s\npresence, but it can nevertheless handle pretty much anything you’d find in\nthe Play Store. However, you will notice slightly longer loading times and the\nodd dropped frame when playing more intensive titles such as PUBG or Asphalt\n8.\n\n![blackberry\nkey2](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe biggest issue experienced my many folk with last year’s KeyOne was just\nhow sluggish it was in operation. However, this likely wasn’t only down to the\nprocessor; the lack of RAM was also a contributory factor.\n\nThe 3GB was updated to 4GB with the KeyOne Black Edition and while that\ntackled some of the issues, six months on it was a painful experience. Upping\nthis to 6GB has made a huge difference right off the bat, and it will be\ninteresting to see if this remains the case over the next few months.\n\nThe Key2’s call quality is impressive, as is Wi-Fi performance, and it’s\nreally in these areas that BlackBerry has consistently impressed. Note, too,\nthat the base 64GB of storage can be expanded via a microSD card.\n\n## **BlackBerry Key2 – Software**\n\nKeyboard aside, a lot of what makes the Key2 feel different to other more\ntraditional flagships is the software. Like the KeyOne, the Key2 uses Android\nrather than BlackBerry’s own OS, so you’re free to download all the apps and\ngames you want from Google Play.\n\nBlackBerry Mobile has still added plenty to the Android experience, adding\nflourishes that should feel familiar to die-hard fans of the series.\n\nShortcuts are built in at a system level and are easy to customise, while\nBlackBerry Hub combines all your messaging and email platforms together into a\nsingle inbox. Most of the tweaks are built with productivity in mind,\nshortening actions that might normally take multiple steps.\n\n**Related:[Best cheap phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-cheap-\nmobile-phones-3430364)**\n\n![blackberry\nkey2](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe launcher used here is similar in some ways to Google’s stock experience,\nonly with deeper customisations. You can swipe up on an app icon to reveal its\nwidgets, while shortcuts to specific app features can be pulled out into\ndedicated icons. An ‘Add Event’ icon can replace your typical Calendar icon to\nquickly take you into the part of the app you’d use the most.\n\nBlackBerry’s focus on business and security can also be seen throughout. The\nDTEK app has featured on previous devices, and it appears once again,\nproviding an overview of how secure your phone is. It will offer tips on how\nto make it more secure – adding a longer passcode, for example.\n\nOther BlackBerry apps include a password-protected locker for storing private\ndocuments and photos (a nice addition) and a couple of BlackBerry’s own Google\nalternatives such as a Notes app, Calendar and Password Manager.\n\nWhile some of the design elements are a little outdated – BlackBerry’s apps\nlack a modern UI and certain aspects such as the large red notification star\nare plain-ugly – this is certainly one of the lighter additions to an Android\nskin I’ve reviewed recently.\n\n## **BlackBerry Key2 – Camera**\n\nI think I’m safe to assume that few people have ever bought a BlackBerry\ndevice for its camera. When the KeyOne was launched, much was made of the\nsensor being the same unit featured in the Pixel, and while that might be\ntrue, the images captured were far from the quality of Google’s then-flagship.\n\n![blackberry\nkey2](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nWith the launch of the Key2, less has been made about the cameras here – even\nthough there’s been a noticeable upgrade. The biggest difference is there are\nnow two 12-megapixel sensors instead of one, with the second acting as a\ntelephoto zoom. There’s an f/1.8 aperture on the main camera, with a narrower\nf/2.6 on the telephoto.\n\nPictures shot with the Key2 aren’t in the same league as pricier flagships\nsuch as the [Pixel 2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-2)\nor Galaxy S9 – obviously – and they can’t compete with the OnePlus 6, either.\nBut for a BlackBerry, and a device where the camera is far from the focal\npoint, it’s capable of taking some decent shots.\n\nThe sunset landscapes below feature lovely colours and plenty of dynamic\nrange, while the fairgrounds rides come across well too.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nColours are nice and bright\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nPictures can look washed out\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nWhere the camera did fall down was in situations where it had to resort to\nauto-HDR. Super-bright shots were often ruined by copious amounts of glare and\nwashed-out colours, while scenes with varying brightness points also looked\npoor.Low-light photos remain an area of weakness, too, with a strong yellow\ntinge and lots of noisey details.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nLower light shots can look good, is there is some light\n\nThe secondary camera is there for 2x zoom, offering a bit more freedom to get\nup-close. Note, however, that the narrower aperture on this sensor does make\nit pretty much useless in anything but the best of light.\n\nBlackBerry Mobile also uses the secondary sensor to enable a portrait mode,\nallowing that faux-bokeh effect to blur the background. Not a single phone has\nreally mastered this effect yet, and while the Key2’s effect is passable, it\nstill feels very fake. Highly detailed areas such as hair strands often miss\nthe blur and I’ve found you need to hold the phone super-still for decent\nresults.\n\nVideo isn’t anything to write home about, either. It can shoot up to 4K at\n24fps, but in my opinion you’re better off sticking to 1080p at 60fps unless\nyou want shaky footage. The lack of OIS becomes very obvious when shooting\nvideo.\n\n## **BlackBerry Key2 – Battery life**\n\nThere are a number of factors that help the Key2 to impress with its battery\nlife. The unit itself is pretty large at 3500mAh, while the Snapdragon 660\nforgoes the best performance for endurance. This is helped, too, by a screen\nthat’s smaller than much of the competition.\n\nBut in my opinion, the real reason I’ve achieved around a day and a half of\npower from the Key2 is that the device just isn’t particularly good at tasks\nthat would normally eat through battery, hence I avoid them.\n\nI haven’t been watching YouTube videos, for example, nor have I been playing\nany games or editing photos. This is a great phone, if you like the keyboard,\nfor messaging and ‘getting stuff done’ – but it’s limited in other areas.\n\nStill, the battery life is decent. The Key2 will make it through the day on a\nsingle charge even with a few hours of calls and heavy messaging on multiple\nplatforms without you every worrying about hitting the red.\n\nCharging up the phone takes around 90 minutes with the supplied USB-C plug and\ncable.\n\n## **Why buy the BlackBerry Key2?**\n\nThere’s no denying it: the Key2 is a niche product that will only appeal to\nBlackBerry die-hards and those who use their phone purely as a messaging and\nemail device. Some of the software additions are nice, but they’re unlikely to\nwin over those have no desire to switch back to device with a physical\nkeyboard.\n\nAt £599, the Key2 is a tough sell, despite it righting many of the wrongs with\nthe KeyOne by improving the design and upping the RAM.\n\nThere are too many other phones I’d recommend at this price. The [OnePlus\n6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/oneplus-6) is £100 cheaper and\nbetter in nearly every sense, while the [Huawei\nP20](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/huawei-p20-pro) and [LG\nG7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/lg-g7) are similarly priced and\nagain much better picks.\n\nBut if the keyboard is what you want then the Key2 is really your only choice\n– and at least that keyboard is very good.\n\n## **Verdict**\n\nFor BlackBerry die-hards only.\n\n## Score\n\n  \n\n### Score in detail\n\n  * Performance 8\n\n  * Camera 7\n\n  * Design 7\n\n  * Battery Life 8\n\n  * Value 6\n\n  * Software 8\n\n  * Calls & Sound 8\n\n  * Screen Quality 8\n\n"}
