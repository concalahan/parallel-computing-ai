Rico pulled out a comedicallybig railgun and shot at both of them until they exploded into a thousandpieces (which, incidentally, appeared to immediately get sucked up into thestorm).However, it was with the second that the grappling hook came into play, withthe booster attachment used to send the gun emplacement flying from its perch.For the fourth, Rico used a more traditional rocket launcher, although he setthe scene by throwing a small automated drone up into the air first to shootdown any foot soldiers that were trying to take him down while he got to workon the gun itself. This was a task made more difficult by the way the windfrom the hurricane kept throwing off the aim of his rockets, but eventually,he found success.With the fourth gun destroyed, our gameplay demonstration came to a close.## First impressionsFrom the looks of things, Avalanche has understood exactly how people like toplay a Just Cause game. The fourth entry is as much about being creative withyour destruction as it is about completing missions and it looks to be all themore impressive as a result.If Just Cause 4 can keep up a similar amount of variety throughout the entiregame, then it could end up being an exceptionally fun sandbox experience.**How do you like to play a Just Cause game?
