By proactively surfacing results and\nanchoring them to the things you see, you'll be able to browse the world\naround you, just by pointing your camera → <https://t.co/A1nUSk8zsK>\n[#io18](https://twitter.com/hashtag/io18?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n[pic.twitter.com/0xNI4dZez8](https://t.co/0xNI4dZez8)\n\n>\n\n> — Google (@Google) [May 8,\n2018](https://twitter.com/Google/status/993923125275340800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n“We realised that you don’t always know exactly the thing you want to get the\nanswer on,” says Clay Bavor, Google’s vice president of virtual and augmented\nreality told [Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/lens-google-visual-search-\ntool-update/).\n\n“So instead of having Lens work where you have to take a photo to get an\nanswer, we’re using Lens Real-Time, where you hold up your phone and Lens\nstarts looking at the scene [then].”\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThere’s also a new feature called Style Match, which can be used for shopping\nfor clothes and furniture. You’ll be able to point your phone at items such as\nlamps or a polo shirt, and find a similar product you can buy.\n\n> In a few weeks, a new Google Lens feature called style match will help you\nlook up visually similar furniture and clothing, so you can find a look you\nlike.

If you don’t\nknow what one of the dishes on a menu is, it will also bring up a picture to\ngive you a helping hand.\n\nThe new beta for Google Lens has a new home. It’s now built directly into the\nnative camera app, rather than sitting within Google Photos.\n\nThe new version is initially coming to more than 10 different Android devices.\nThe Google Pixel phones, the new [LG G7\nThinQ](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/lg-g7) and the forthcoming\nOnePlus 6 are among those gaining access, as are devices from LGE, Motorola,\nXiaomi, Sony Mobile, HMD/Nokia, Transsion, TCL, BQ and Asus.\n\nOn the LG G7 ThinQ, a dedicated Lens button will summon the feature when\npressed twice. If the phone doesn’t have a dedicated button, the feature can\nbe accessed via the main on-screen camera options.\n\n## How to get Google Lens\n\nBack in March, Google Lens rolled out on iOS following its debut on all\nAndroid smartphones – with select handsets also set to receive the option to\ntoggle the feature using Google Assistant in the future.\n\nAnnounced during Google I/O 2017, Lens debuted on the Google Pixel range in\nOctober, although it didn’t enter the mainstream until November when Big G\nstarted to bake the tool into Google Assistant on both the Google Pixel and\n[Google Pixel 2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-2).\n\nGoogle Lens was designed to surface relevant information using visual\nanalysis. It can record information stored on a business card, for example,\nand even connect to a Wi-Fi network by scanning the credentials embedded in a\nrouter’s casing.\n\n> Rolling out today, Android users can try Google Lens to do things like\ncreate a contact from a business card or get more info about a famous\nlandmark.

It arrived on\nmost, if not all, Android smartphones on March 5, before starting its rollout\nfor iOS – iPad, [iPhone](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-x) and\niPod – the week commencing March 12.\n\n> Starting today and rolling out over the next week, those of you on iOS can\ntry the preview of Google Lens to quickly take action from a photo or discover\nmore about the world around you.
