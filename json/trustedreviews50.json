The social network\nhas amassed a terrifying amount of data about us since it was founded in 2004.\nEven without the current scandal taking place, it’s still creepy.\n\nBut before you go ahead and delete your account, it’s well worth making a full\ndownload of your entire account. If you’re anything like us, you’ve probably\nspent the last decade uploading your entire digital life to the platform, and\nit would be a shame to lose that many photos, videos and, let’s face it,\nexcruciatingly embarrassing statuses.\n\n**Related:[How to delete your Facebook\naccount](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-delete-facebook-\naccount-2950145)**\n\n## How to download your Facebook data\n\nDownloading your Facebook data is actually surprisingly easy. Log into your\naccount and click the downwards-facing arrow on the top right of the page.\nFrom the drop-down menu that appears, select Settings.\n\nFrom here you should click the ‘Download a copy of your Facebook data’\nhyperlink. It’s a little hard to see because it’s there as a plain hyperlink,\nbut it’s located just below the ‘Manage account’ menu option.\n\nUnfortunately, with so much data to download it’s not an instantaneous\nprocess. You’ll receive an email to tell you that your profile is in the\nprocess of being prepared, and then around an hour later you’ll receive a\nsecond saying that your download is ready.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Cyber Monday UK 2018](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Cyber Monday UK 2018: When is Cyber Monday 2018?\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/cyber-monday-uk-2018-3342930 \"Cyber\nMonday UK 2018: When is Cyber Monday 2018?\")\n\n  * [ ![best horror films](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Halloween 2018: Best horror movies and scary films to watch on Netflix UK\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/best-horror-movies-netflix-halloween-\nfilms-3607041 \"Halloween 2018: Best horror movies and scary films to watch on\nNetflix UK\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Mi Mix 3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Xiaomi Mi Mix 3 UK release teased in plain sight by Three\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/xiaomi-mi-mix-3-uk-release-date-price-\nspecs-3610596 \"Xiaomi Mi Mix 3 UK release teased in plain sight by Three\")\n\n  * \n\nClick the link that’s emailed to you, and you’ll be able to download a nice\n.zip file of all your data.\n\nNow the fun starts. Here’s what I learned from looking at my profile.\n\n**Related:[Amazon Easter sale](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/amazon-\neaster-sale-uk-3425830)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe button to download your Facebook data is easy to miss\n\n## My first status proves I was an arsehole at 16\n\nThe single most embarrassing thing I discovered in all of my Facebook data was\nthe first status I ever posted on the service when I made my account back in\n2008, and frankly I’ve never hated myself more.\n\nI was, shall we say, a verbose teenager. You know that kid that thinks he’s\nbetter than everyone else because his vocabulary is slightly better and he’s\nactually read ‘Fight Club’. Yeah, that was me.\n\nLiterally the only saving grace about this status is that it’s ten years old,\nbut even then it’s pretty atrocious.\n\nAnyway, here we go. My first ever Facebook status, posted on Tuesday the 19th\nof August 2008 at 15:16 was, “Why a wall, really? I mean paper is much more\nconvenient, it’s small, it’s portable and if no one writes anything on it I\ncan learn how to turn it into an ‘ickle swan. Also if someone writes you a\nmean message on a piece of paper you can burn it, try burning a wall and all\nhell breaks loose. Can you tell I’m new at facebook?”\n\n## I have literally only ‘Poked’ someone once\n\nI’ve never really understood Facebook Pokes. Are they a means of getting\nsomeone’s attention, or is it a way of flirting with a school crush without\ncommitting to saying something embarrassing?\n\nEvidently I never bothered to master one of the more arcane forms of Facebook\ncommunication because my data reveals that I’ve Poked someone just once in the\n10 years I’ve been using the service.\n\nI did so at 10 minutes to midnight on the 13th of January 2016, and my second\nyear university roommate was the recipient.\n\nNo, I don’t know why it happened either.\n\n## The only advertiser that cares about me is PlayStation\n\nOne of the creepier pieces of information you can download from Facebook is a\nlist of all the companies that have paid to have your contact information.\n\nIf you’d told me that before I’d looked at the list myself I would have\nguessed that a bunch of super hip startups had requested my contact details,\nor maybe a political party or two.\n\nNope, just 13 European divisions of Sony PlayStation. Thanks guys.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Facebook has absolutely all of my phone contacts\n\nA genuinely astonishing realisation was that Facebook has access to literally\nall of my phone contacts.\n\nI have a vague recollection about giving the app permission to access this\ninformation, but there’s something a lot more striking about seeing my boss’\nphone number just sitting there in between a couple of PR contacts — none of\nwhom I’ve even come close to adding on Facebook.\n\nIt’s a stark reminder that if you give an app permission to access some of the\ndata on your phone, then you can be damn sure that app is going to take full\nadvantage of it.\n\n## I’ve been ‘Facebook official’ with four people, but I only dated two of\nthem\n\nThere’s a lot in my Facebook data that I don’t quite understand because I\ncan’t remember its context. My past relationships are one of them.\n\nThere are four people listed under ‘Relationships’ in my Facebook data. Two of\nthem are girlfriends I dated when I was in sixth form, but two of them are\njust childhood friends.\n\nThere are two possible reasons for this: either I was so close with these two\nschool friends that it tricked Facebook into thinking we were in a\nrelationship, or I told Facebook they were my boyfriends as part of some\nstupid joke.\n\nGiven that Facebook has failed to identify any of my post-school\nrelationships, I’d wager it’s the latter.\n\n![Facebook dislike\nbutton](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## I’ve used way too many dating apps\n\nAlso listed in your Facebook data are all the apps that currently have access\nto your Facebook data. It’s an especially important list when you consider\nthat Cambridge Analytica allegedly acquired its Facebook data through such an\napp.\n\nFor the most part, my list of apps is fairly unremarkable. Spotify has access\nto my data, along with JustGiving and my bank, Monzo.\n\nBut more embarrassing are the sheer amount of dating apps that I’ve signed\ninto over the years which include (deep breath); Once, The Inner Circle,\nOkCupid, Tinder, Bumble and Coffee Meets Bagel.\n\nWere it not for my first Facebook status this would be the most embarrassing\ndata point here.\n\n**Related:[Protect your Facebook data from third-party\napps](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/facebook-apps-settings-cambridge-\nanalytica-3428637)**\n\n## I have a memory like a sieve when it comes to old Facebook friends\n\nAside from your Facebook pictures, nothing makes you feel older than looking\nat all the Facebook friends you’ve forgotten about over the years.\n\nAlthough the amount of Facebook friends I have currently stands at 652 people,\nI’ve unfriended an additional 48 over the past decade. I’ve declined 52 friend\nrequests from people I don’t know and my dad, and — most depressingly of all —\nI’ve sent out seven friend requests that never got a response.\n\nBut, delightfully, downloading my data showed me that the second ever friend I\nmade on the service is someone I’m still in contact with. He lives across the\nroad from me, and we still find the time to play PUBG a few times a week\ntogether.\n\nThe first friend I ever made, naturally, was a girl who I had a crush on at\nthe time.\n\nPriorities.\n\n**Related:[Amazon Easter Sale](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/amazon-\neaster-sale-uk-3425830)**\n\n**Are you planning to delete your Facebook account?
