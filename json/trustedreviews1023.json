These Bitcoins are accepted as payment for a variety of goods and\nservices, with a key appeal for their use being the anonymity they grant.\n\nEver since the initial creation and release of the Bitcoin in 2009, there have\nbeen questions as to the digital currency’s provenance.\n\nIt’s long been associated with one Satoshi Nakamoto, although this was\neventually revealed to be a pseudonym. After various investigations and\nnumerous theories, a consensus seemed to have been reached that Australian\nentrepeneur Craig Wright was the true author of the Bitcoin.\n\nThe man himself, however, has never admitted this to be the case. Until now.\n\nIn a filmed interview with the\n[BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36168863), Wright has finally\nconfirmed that he is indeed the father of Bitcoin – or at least “the main part\nof it,” with help from other parties.\n\nWright has provided technical proof to back up his claim, including evidence\nthat he was behind the first ever Bitcoin transaction in 2009.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nShortly after Wright went public with his admission, chief scientist at the\nBitcoin Foundation Gavin Andresen wrote a [blog\npost](http://gavinandresen.ninja/satoshi) supporting his claim. One of the\nfounding directors of the Bitcoin Foundation, Jon Matonis, also gave his\nsupport to Wright.\n\nAsked why he had decided to reveal himself to the world, Wright said: “I\ndidn’t decide. I had people decide this matter for me. They’re making life\ndifficult not for me, but my friends, my family, my staff.”\n\n**Related:[What is Bitcoin?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/what-is-\nbitcoin)**\n\nWright also insisted that he wasn’t interested in making money from his\nadmission. “I don’t want money, I don’t want fame, I don’t want adoration. I\njust want to be left alone,” he said.\n\nHe also insisted that he would “never accept a cent” from any awards committee\nfor the creation of Bitcoin.\n\nWright claimed that this was the only interview he would ever give on the\nmatter, though GQ and The Economist also received the confirmation.\n\n"}
