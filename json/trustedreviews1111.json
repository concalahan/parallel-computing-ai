Check out our **[Xperia XZ3 hands-on\nreview](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sony-xperia-xz3) ** for our\nearly impressions, see how it matches up to Sony’s early-2018 flagship in our\n**[Xperia XZ3 vs Xperia XZ2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/sony-xperia-\nxz3-vs-xz2-3542378)** comparison, or relive all the action as it happened by\nchecking out our **[Sony Xperia XZ3 launch live\nstream](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/sony-xperia-xz3-live-stream-watch-\nifa-2018-3544054)** guide.\n\nOutside of phones, the Japanese giant also had a number of [Sony\nheadphones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/sony-\nwh-1000xm3-vs-1000xm2-headphones-3544252) to show off, including the new\nnoise-cancelling flagships, the\n[WH-1000XM3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sony-wh-1000xm3), its\nSP900 true wireless sports earbuds and its ultra-premium IER-Z1R in-ear\nmonitors.\n\n![IFA\n2018](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Samsung at IFA 2018: Finally, an 8K TV you can actually own!\n\nSouth Korean tech giant Samsung may have already stolen the show at IFA,\nrevealing at 8K TV that will actually go on sale this year.\n\nYes, you read that right – this isn’t a working prototype, proof of concept ,\nor anything else related to technological snake oil: you’re going to be able\nto buy the [Samsung Q900R 8K\nTV](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-q900r-8k), provided you’ve\ngot deep enough pockets.\n\nThe future-facing set will start hitting shelves (including in the UK, we\nunderstand) as soon as September, and we’ll be getting more familiar with the\nset as the day progresses, so stay tuned for more!\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## IFA 2018 News: Acer in swift slew of IFA reveals\n\nAcer has gotten off to a flyer at IFA this year, revealing a host of new\nproducts across it computing ranges.\n\nThe [new Acer Swift laptops](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/acer-swift-\nlaptops-2018-3543050) are probably the headline act so far, with the Taiwanese\nfirm slimming down its existing [Swift\n7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/acer-swift-7), [Swift\n5](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/acer-swift-5) and [Swift\n3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/acer-swift-3) notebooks even further\nas it bids to find a place in your heart (and rucksack) this year.\n\nThen there’s the [Acer OJO 500](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/acer-\nojo-500-windows-mixed-reality-headset-3543042) Windows Mixed Reality headset.\nWhile partly aimed at businesses, we’re nevertheless intrigued by the promise\nof a modular VR device with a detachable head strap and headphone-free audio\nand can’t wait to try it on for size.\n\nElsewhere, there’s new gaming gear courtesy of the company’s Predator and\nNitro ranges. There’s some [new Acer gaming\nmonitors](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/acer-gaming-monitors-3543196),\nbut the real highlight is – for maybe the first time in IFA history – a gaming\nchair.\n\nExcept it’s not just any ole’ gaming chair. It’s the Acer Predator Thronos,\nwhich more closely resembles (we imagine) the cockpit of a TIE fighter. Don’t\njust take out word for it though, have a good gawk at it for yourself.\n\n**Related:[Best gaming monitors](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\ngaming-monitor-3439027)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nOr do we actually want to walk away with the [Acer Predator Triton\n900](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/acer-predator-triton-900)? The 4K\n2-in-1 features the Taiwanese firm’s latest Aeroblade fans, which – get this –\nare inspired by owl feathers.\n\nSadly, we weren’t able to try it out properly (as you can see, it was drooling\nroom-only in Berlin), but if ever there was a silver lining, it’s that this\nmeans it’ll likely pack Nvidia’s new Turning GPUs and Intel’s forthcoming 9th-\nGen Core CPUs when it does launch.\n\nGo on, say it with us now: “PHWOAR”.\n\n![A pre-production Acer Predator Triton 900, stuck in a display case at IFA\n2018.](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## IFA 2018 News: LG reveals ‘world’s first’ 8K OLED TV in Berlin\n\nLG has kicked off IFA 2018 with a bang, unveiling an 8K OLED TV at the Berlin\nshowcase. Boasting a whopping 7680 x 4320 resolution, it packs more than 33\nmillion pixels into its 88-inch frame, with the South Korean chaebol hailing\nits new set as the “world’s first 8K OLED TV.”\n\nTo our eye, this would appear to be an accurate claim. Though rival\nmanufacturers like Panasonic and Samsung have shown off 8K TVs in the past,\nthese tellies haven’t utilised the OLED display technology that LG has helped\nbring to prominence in the TV world by way of excellent efforts like the [LG\nc8 OLED.](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/lg-c8-oled)\n\nWhile an exciting development, what isn’t clear at this stage is if LG’s new\n8K OLED will ever hit the consumer market. LG has said it expects the 8K\nmarket to start to really take off by 2022, but it hasn’t attached a price,\nrelease date, or even product name to the TV, so it could be that it’s little\nmore than a prototype – we’ve reached out to LG for clarification and will\nreport back as soon as we learn more.\n\n**Related:[OLED vs LED LCD TVs\nexplained](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/oled-vs-led-lcd-2924602)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nOn the ground with us in Berlin? You can see LG’s 8K OLED for yourself at\nbooth in Hall 18 of the Messe Berlin.\n\n## IFA 2018 News: Bang & Olufsen unveils Beosound Edge wireless speaker\n\nPremium Danish consumer electronics company Bang & Olufsen as also started its\nIFA 2018 party early, treating us to a characteristically snazzy new wireless\nspeaker in the [Beosound Edge](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/bang-\nolufsen-beosound-edge-3542411).\n\nDeveloped in collaboration with noted designer Michael Anastassiades, it’s a\n£2900 aluminium beast that can either sit on the floor like a piece of\nfurniture, or be hung on the wall as a piece of sound-emitting artwork.\n\nInspired by the shape of the classic pound coin, the Beosound Edge isn’t just\nbreathtaking to ogle – its got some seriously nifty features worth writing\nhome about, too.\n\nThe big talking point is that you can rock it back and forth to adjust the\nvolume, or if you prefer more traditional controls, there’s a touch interface\nbuilt-in to the frame. In terms of components, it’s no slouch, packing a\n3/4-inch tweeter, two 4-inch midrange drivers for 360-degree sound, and a a\n10-inch woofer on one side. B&O also claims the Beosound Edge offers the\nworld’s ‘first active bass port’, which fuses two classic speaker design\nconcepts – closed box and ported – into one, while wireless compatibility\ncomes in the form of Bluetooth, Airplay 2 and Chromecast support.\n\nAs you’d expect from a stunning B&O speaker that stands out from the crowd in\npretty much every way imaginable, all this doesn’t come cheap, with the\nBeoedge Sound set to retail for £2900 when it releases in November 2018, or\n€3250 in continental coppers.\n\n**Related:[Best Bluetooth\nspeakers](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/bluetooth-speakers-3431819)**\n\n![IFA\n2018](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## IFA 2018 News: The best of the rest\n\nThose are just some of the early IFA 2018 highlights – there’s been loads more\ngoing on Berlin, and things are only just getting started!\n\nIn key computing news, **Intel** announced the latest members of its 8th Gen\nCore processor family. The U-series (née Whiskey Lake) and Y-series (codenamed\nAmber Lake) processors are specially designed for new-gen ultra-portables –\nsome of which we’ve already seen debuted at IFA.\n\nThe most noteworthy of these might be the updated [Dell XPS\n13](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/dell-xps-13). Already one of the\n[best laptops](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-laptops-3431966) of\n2018 in the eyes of Reviews Editor Alastair Stevenson, the refresh adds the\nnew chips to **Dell’s** already impressive PC package and should mean improved\nbattery life and mobile performance. The [Dell XPS 13\n2-in-1](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/dell-xps-13-2-in-1) is getting\na boost, too, and we’re looking forward to getting our hands on both devices\nin the very near future.\n\nNot to be left out of the action, we’ve also seen a number of [**Acer** laptop\nannouncements](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/acer-aspire-2018-3544550)\nat this year’s show, along with [**Lenovo** ‘s IFA laptop\nofferings](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lenovo-\nchromebooks-2018-3544420) (including the [Yoga Book\nC930](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/yoga-book), the [Yoga\nC930](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/lenovo-yoga-c930) and the [Yoga\nC630](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/lenovo-yoga-c630-wos-first-\nlook)). Lenovo also announced an update to its augmented reality Star Wars\ngame which offers a [Kylo Ren-inspired\nlightsaber](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/jedi-challenges-dark-side-\nexpansion-3544373).\n\nIf you want to get any of these laptops connected to the internet, then why\nnot give [**Netgear** ‘s Orbi\nVoice](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/netgear-orbi-voice-price-release-\ndate-3542293) a look? This addition to the Netgear Orbi lineup is also an\nAlexa speaker, so you can flood your home with Wi-Fi alongside the voice\nassistant.\n\nIf B&O’s gorgeous but pricey Beosound Edge doesn’t quite fit your budget,\nyou’ll want to know about the latest smart wireless speakers from affordable\nDanish brand **Libratone**. The Zipp 2 and Zipp 2 Mini are Bluetooth bellowers\nwith added Alexa smarts and, at a more modest £279/£229 (respectively), well\nworth checking out – we gave the first [Libratone\nZipp](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/libratone-zipp-nordic-black) a\nstrong 8/10 score in our review, so there’s pedigree here for the price point.\n\nSpeaking of Bluetooth, **Qualcomm** had a new aptX standard to announce, which\nshould eventually make the process of connecting your audio devices that\nlittle bit less painless since [AptX\nAdaptive](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/aptx-adaptive-specs-3542330)\nwill be able to intelligently adjust itself based on your surroundings and\nneeds.\n\nFinally, it just wouldn’t be IFA without some white goods and [**Sharp** has\ndelivered something pretty\ninteresting](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/sharp-smart-intellidos-\nwashing-machine-3543125), a washing machine that tracks your usage and is able\nto intelligently order cleaning supplies via Amazon Dash. Now you just need to\nremember to do your washing in the first place.\n\n## IFA 2018 Dates: When is IFA being held in Berlin this year?\n\nIFA 2018 will run from **August 31 through September 5** , with most of the\nbig announcements tipped to take place at media events held between August\n29-31.\n\n**Related:[Best VPNs](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-vpn-3470328)**\n\n**What’s your highlight of IFA 2018 in Berlin so far?
