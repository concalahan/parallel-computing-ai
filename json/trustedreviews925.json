{"result": 0, "title": "10 things Google should have announced at I/O 2016 – but didn't | Trusted Reviews", "description": "**The dust has settled on Google’s I/O 2016 keynote, and there’s plenty of new\nstuff to talk about. But forget about that, because we have 10 bones to pick\nwith Google.**\n\nWe heard about VR software. We heard about artificial intelligence. We heard\nabout _another_ new messaging app, as if there weren’t enough of those\nalready. Google’s searching is smarter, Google’s software is more popular, and\nGoogle’s Googling is more Googlier. But while the keynote was chock with news,\nwe remain clueless on a few matters. Here’s a roundup of all the things Google\nchose not to reveal at its annual developer conference.\n\n_Dear Google, why didn’t you talk about…_\n\n## Android N’s release date\n\nThis is the big one. The latest version of Google’s mobile OS – [Android\nN](https://www.trustedreviews.com/android-n-review) – is coming, but we knew\nthat already. What we still don’t know is exactly when it will arrive, and\nit’s unlikely that we’ll find out for quite some time. While it’s almost\nguaranteed that the new software will become available in its final, consumer-\nready form around autumn – alongside the probable launch of a new Nexus phone\n– Google has yet to pin down a specific date. Boo!\n\nOn the bright side, Google did announce the [availability of the Android N\nrelease candidate beta](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/android-n-uk-\nrelease-date-and-name-google-reveals-android-nutella-i-o-2016). That means\nit’s now stable enough to use on your primary device – provided it’s a Nexus –\nrather than having to play with it on a secondary handset.\n\n![Android\nN](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\n**Related:[Best Android Apps 2016](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-\nandroid-apps_round-up)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n## New Nexus phones\n\nPrior to I/O, some speculated that Google was going to bring up the matter of\nthis year’s new Nexus phone(s), which is/are expected to be mere months away.\nUnfortunately, Google remained quiet on the issue – we didn’t even get a\nteaser. That’s not surprising, as I/O is a software conference (mostly).\n\nFortunately, we’re not entirely in the dark. There are rumours floating around\nin the ether that Google might actually be building the phone itself this\nyear, just like 2015’s [Pixel C](https://www.trustedreviews.com/google-pixel-\nc-review), which was also produced in-house. Other sources point to HTC being\nthe chief contender for Nexus phone manufacturer in 2016. We can’t say for\ncertain either way, so stay tuned.\n\n![Nexus\n6P](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## A new Nexus 7\n\nThe [Nexus 7 (2012)](https://www.trustedreviews.com/google-nexus-7-review) is\nstill one of the most beloved Android tablets of all time. Its [2013 follow-\nup](https://www.trustedreviews.com/nexus-7-2-2013-review) was also critically\nacclaimed. Then came the ill-fated [Nexus\n9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/nexus-9-review) in 2014, and the oddball,\ncustom-built Pixel C in 2015. It’s no surprise that Android fans are longing\nfor the days of yore.\n\nA new Nexus 7 has been heavily rumoured for imminent launch, and some thought\nthat Google would drop news about the tablet at I/O 2016. That didn’t happen,\nwhich is a shame. Nevertheless, our fingers remain tightly crossed for an\nannouncement this autumn. Please, Google.\n\n![Nexus 7](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Google Chirp\n\nGoogle was heavily rumoured to be plotting an Amazon Echo-style AI speaker,\nset to be revealed at I/O under the name “Chirp”.\n\nIn fact, Google didn’t announce Chirp – this turned out to be little more than\na codename. Instead, Google announced “Home”, which is basically the same\nthing, but with a less stupid name. Great news.\n\nYou can read more about [Google\nHome](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-home-specs-features-price-uk-\nrelease-date) here.\n\n![Google\nHome](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Android N’s real name\n\nGoogle could have quite easily announced [Android\nNutella](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/android-n-name), and we could all\nhave gone home in peace.\n\nBut Google, the ruddy tease, isn’t ready to drop the name just yet. Instead,\nit’s launched a new website that outsources the decision to you, loyal Android\nfans. Yes, Google has asked the internet to choose its favourite word\nbeginning with “N”.\n\nNougat? Is it nougat?\n\n[Vote here](https://www.android.com/versions/name-n/)\n\n![Nutella](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## An official Google VR headset  \n\nVirtual reality, it’s finally here, and tech companies everywhere are\ndesperately scrambling for relevance in the VR space. Google was early to the\ngame with the Cardboard VR, but the budget-friendly viewer pales in comparison\nto titans such as the [Oculus Rift](https://www.trustedreviews.com/oculus-\nrift-review) and [HTC Vive](https://www.trustedreviews.com/htc-vive-review).\nThat’s why everyone was expecting Google to show off something more\nsubstantial at I/O 2016, thanks to rumours of an “Android VR” codename.\n\nWell, Google sort of did, and sort of didn’t. Google really has built a new VR\nheadset, but you’ll never be able to buy it. It’s actually just a reference\ndesign, which means third-party companies can copy all (or some) of it for\ntheir own products. Google also showed off a motion-sensitive controller –\nalso a reference design – at the keynote. You can’t buy this either.\n\nOh, and there’s a new VR platform called\n[Daydream](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/daydream-google-has-built-a-vr-\nheadset-and-controller-for-android), which you will be able to use. But not\nyet.\n\n![daydream](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \n**Related:[Android Pay vs Apple\nPay](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/android-pay-vs-apple-pay)**\n\n## Driverless Cars\n\nBeyond virtual reality, driverless cars are almost certainly the next big\nthing. Google has long established itself as a key player in the space, but\ntoday’s keynote skipped straight over vehicle autonomy.\n\nWith the rival [Apple Car](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-car-news-\nrumours-driverless-price-release-date-electric) rumoured to be in development,\nGoogle may be playing its cards close to its chest. That, or Google simply has\ntoo little to show off at this early stage. Whatever the reason, we’ll have to\nwait a little longer to understand what Google’s big vision is for the future\nof transport.\n\n![Google\ncar](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Project Tango\n\nGoogle is certainly invested in VR, but it’s giving AR a whirl too. [Project\nTango](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/google-project-tango-hololens-\nfor-the-masses) is Google’s effort in the augmented-reality space – that’s\nwhen virtual objects are overlaid onto reality, just like [Microsoft’s\nHoloLens](https://www.trustedreviews.com/microsoft-hololens-review).\n\nIt was rumoured that Google would divulge new details on Project Tango and its\nintegration with Intel’s RealSense 3D camera, but the keynote gave it a miss.\nSoz.\n\n![Project\nTango](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Project Ara\n\nSeriously, what the hell happened to Project Ara?\n\nIn 2015, Google’s curious modular smartphone moonshot was all anybody could\ntalk about. But all’s gone quiet on that front for the past few months, and\nwe’ve been left in the dark about a Google project that finally represented\nsome real innovation in the smartphone space.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/statuses/633358044517154816\n\nMaybe Google has come to the realisation that modular smartphones are actually\npretty hard to pull off, as LG recently discovered with its tepidly received\n[LG G5](https://www.trustedreviews.com/lg-g5-review). But according to the\nofficial Project Ara Twitter account, the phone is still due for a 2016\nrollout. We’re not so sure.\n\n![Project\nAra](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Project Fi Expansion  \n\nBack in February, Google rocked up to Mobile World Congress in Barcelona with\nnews that [Project Fi](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/what-is-\nproject-fi-can-google-change-the-mobile-industry-forever) was finally\nlaunching. The MVNO (Mobile Virtual Network Operator) service – Google\noffering its own phone network by piggybacking on Sprint and T-Mobile – was\nmade available for Nexus users in the US.\n\nIt was expected that Google might expand Project Fi beyond the Nexus range –\nor even into new countries – at I/O 2016, but the opportunity was missed. What\ngives, Google?\n\n![Google Project\nFi](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \n**Related:[Best Android Smartphones 2016](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-\nandroid-phones-1_round-up)**  \n **  \nHands-on with Google’s Android N:**\n\n**What did you think of this year’s Google I/O keynote?
