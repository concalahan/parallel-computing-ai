Let’s compare them to find out.\n\n## **Sony XZ2 vs XZ2 Compact performance and specs – Mostly the same, which is\ngreat**\n\nSony’s Xperia Compact series has always been highly regarded because it offers\nsmall devices, but without sacrificing the high-end specs. Thankfully, things\nremain the same here.\n\nBoth phones pack the brand-new [Snapdragon\n845](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/snapdragon-845-benchmark-phones-\nspeed-3390981), 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. They’re also IP68 water-\nresistant and have ditched the headphone jack in place of a USB-C dongle.\n\nThe screen sizes are different – 5.7-inch vs 5-inch – but both offer 1080p\nresolutions, 18:9 aspect ratios and the ability to display HDR content. They\ncan even upscale SDR content to something brighter, with more contrast and\ndynamic range.\n\nYou’ll also benefit from great sound on both phones, since each model creates\nvirtual surround sound from a combination of the top and bottom speaker. Sony\nsays the speakers are 20% louder than previous models, and in our short demo\nwe felt they sounded a lot better, too.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAnother interesting thing to note is that both phones offer identical models\nof camera; Sony hasn’t retained the camera tricks for the more expensive\ndevice.\n\nBoth handsets feature the new ISP (image signal processor) for reducing noise\nand improving detail, offer the ability to shoot 4K HDR footage and present\nall the 3D facial-capturing smarts. A 19-megapixel memory stacked sensor sits\non the rear of both phones, which is capable of capturing a short burst of\n1080p video at 960fps.\n\nAround the front of the XZ2 and XZ2 Compact is a 5-megapixel selfie camera,\noffering the ability to scan your face to create a 3D model.\n\nThere are a couple of differences to be aware of, however. The bigger XZ has a\nlarger battery, boasting a 3180mAh unit as opposed to 2870mAh one. A more\nniche difference is that while the XZ2 can reach download speeds of 1.2gbps,\nthe Compact can manage only 800mbps. However, both support 4X4 MiMO for\ngreater wireless range and reliability.\n\n## **Sony XZ2 vs XZ2 Compact features – The bigger phone has a few more\ntricks**\n\nThe most obvious feature that you’ll only find in the bigger XZ2 model is\nsomething Sony has dubbed ‘Dynamic Vibration’. This is a new system that adds\nsomething extra to movies, games and music.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSony likened it to a PS4’s Dualshock 4 during the demos, but something that\nworks across multiple parts of the phone. We were shown a movie trailer where\nthe vibrations became stronger during an explosion, and another when you hit\nsomething in a game of Angry Birds. It’s a neat feature, but one that probably\nwon’t be the reason you choose the XZ2 over some of the competition.\n\nAnother XZ2 exclusive feature is Qi wireless charging, which is annoyingly\nabsent from the Compact.\n\n## **Sony XZ2 vs XZ2 Compact design – There’s a clear winner here**\n\nThe biggest downside of picking the XZ2 Compact over the XZ2 is the design.\nWhere the XZ2 uses glass, the Compact swaps it for plastic.\n\nBoth phones have a reduced bezel when compared to their predecessors, but the\nXZ2 certainly looks better in our eyes, offering up a sleeker body and less of\na bulbous finish.\n\nThe bigger dimensions of the XZ do result in a heavier device (198g vs 168g),\nbut this difference wasn’t noticeable in the hand. In fact, the larger size\nand better weight distribution actually made the XZ feel more comfortable and\nlighter.\n\nBoth devices feature a fingerprint scanner on the rear, a USB-C port along the\nbottom edge and a shutter button on the side to quickly launch the camera.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## **Sony XZ2 vs XZ2 Compact value – What’s the price difference?**\n\nAt the time of writing, Sony hasn’t announced pricing details for either\ndevice. But going on previous launches, the XZ2 Compact will be priced lower\nthan its larger sibling. We’ll provide an update once we have confirmed\npricing.\n\n## **Sony XZ2 vs XZ2 Compact – verdict**\n\nWe have to applaud Sony for sticking to its guns and pushing the Xperia XZ2\nCompact as a true small flagship, rather than just sticking in some lower-end\ncomponents. It doesn’t quite have all the features of the XZ2, but it’s close.\n\n**Related:[Best Samsung Galaxy S9\ndeals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-samsung-\ngalaxy-s9-deals-3402357)**\n\nThe company’s decision to switch up the design is most welcome, and there are\nplenty of features included in both of these phones that could make it a good\npick. We’d also guess that the devices will come in cheaper than [Samsung\nGalaxy S9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9) and\n[iPhone 8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-8), although unlikely\nat the [OnePlus 5T](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/oneplus-5t) price.\n\n"}
