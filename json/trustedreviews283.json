Despite some initial reluctance, it looks and plays\nbrilliantly from the brief hands-on time we’ve had with the upcoming open-\nworld shooter. Playing as the Last Ranger, you explore a post-apocalyptic\nworld littered with strange creatures, hostile punks and plenty of loot simply\nwaiting to be pillaged.\n\n_Trusted Reviews_ has compiled everything you need to know about Rage 2\nincluding all the latest news, release date, trailers and our hand-on preview!\n\n## What is Rage 2?\n\nRage is an open world first-person shooter set in a sprawling wasteland\nsimilar to the first game. Players will be in possession of an assortment of\nlethal weapons including the absurdly stylish Wingstick.\n\nAlthough the original was developed by id Software, development duties for\nthis instalment have passed to Swedish developer Avalanche Studios, who\npreviously developed the three previous Just Cause games.\n\n**Related:** **[Call of Duty Black Ops\n4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-4-3373836)**\n\n**![rage 2\n](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)**\n\nVehicles will play a large role alongside the mountain of firearms you’ll be\nshooting about the place. The first trailer showcases several different\nvarieties, many of which give off the impression that players can customise\nthings however they like.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n## Rage 2 story – what’s it about?\n\nThe original post-apocalyptic shooter ended on a surprise cliffhanger that\nleft dedicated fans clamouring for more, and they haven’t received any\nresolution for eight long years.\n\nMany of them are probably hoping for a sequel that addresses those events, and\nconsidering the title, we may see just that.\n\n## Rage 2 trailer – How does it look?\n\nHere’s the latest Rage 2 trailer from QuakeCon 2018, showcasing an extensive\nlook at the Eden Assault demo first unveiled at E3 2018. Having played parts\nof this section ourselves, the trailer is a great representation of the chaos\nyou’ll be unleashing.\n\n## Rage 2 gameplay preview\n\nRage 2 came so close to being a surprise announcement (thanks Walmart). Even\nstill, the reveal of a sequel of an eight-year-old game was welcomed by many.\nConsidering Rage’s mixed reception, many assumed the franchise lost to the\nages. Instead, we now see two of the biggest studios in the industry\ncollaborating to make what is set to be an incredibly exciting shooter.\nCombining id Software’s technical excellence with shooters with Avalanche’s\nability to create enticing open worlds with enjoyable ways to explore them,\nhow can you go wrong?\n\nGetting the chance to play a snippet of a shooting section, the most\nunsurprising statement is that the teams haven’t put a foot out of place thus\nfar. It’s great to see that the id DNA has been carried through, while also\nbeing wrapped in an utterly bonkers and beautifully colourful skin. It’s\nbecome one of my most anticipated games of 2019.\n\n**Related:[Super Smash Bros\nUltimate](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/smash-bros-nintendo-switch-\nrelease-date-gameplay-2949964)**\n\n![rage 2](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nWhile early Rage 2 trailers show much of the game’s personality in its giant\npost-post-apocalyptic open world, brought forth in large part thanks to\nAvalanche’s incredible pedigree from the Just Cause series and also the superb\nMad Max game, the E3 gameplay segment focuses very much on gunplay in tight\nspaces.\n\nBut that’s okay, because this allows the insanity of its inhabitants to come\nto the fore and create some great moments, as well as show off the\ncollaboration of the two teams, with guns and abilities becoming the focal\npoint of this early insight.\n\nRage 2 is set 30 years after its predecessor, meaning fans left hanging onto\nits predecessor’s cliffhanger will finally get the answers for which they’ll\nhave waited nine years by the time it arrives next year.\n\nThe lead character, Ranger Walker, is voiced – and the game benefits hugely as\na result. The aesthetic of Rage 2 also greatly benefits from the leap forward\nin time. By becoming a “post-post apocalyptic” game, time previously spent\ndriving for miles across barren wasteland (read: boring, brown desert) is now\nreplaced with lush greenery, towering forests and giant structures. The early\nfootage shown, and the snippet I played, is already a far more interesting,\nand visually stimulating proposition.\n\nThe demo takes place inside a tower, where Ranger must infiltrate and move\nthrough in order to activate a beacon on the top floor. The demo plonks Ranger\njust outside the building, where a few enemies are dotted around outside.\nTaking the time to observe them gives each small cluster a chance to talk, and\nshow that, as you might expect, apocalypse survivors aren’t all the ticket.\n\nAvalanche channels that Mad Max style into these characters as they spray-\npaint walls, play baseball and generally be a bit bonkers. It’s fun to\neavesdrop on the conversations that take place before all the shooting starts.\nI approached the venue with caution, wondering if I could perhaps sneak in and\ngain the upper hand. Pro gamer tip: don’t bother sneaking in Rage 2; just jump\nin and start shooting everything.\n\n**Related:[DOOM Eternal](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/doom-eternal-\nrelease-date-3483704)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nRage 2 feels very much like an id Software shooter with the addition of\nDestiny 2 abilities. In this demo, Ranger is equipped with a dash along with\ntwo over abilities: slam and shatter. Slam sees him jump into the air before\ncrashing back down to earth and dealing damage to anybody in the immediate\nvicinity, while shatter is the equivalent of a force push that sends very\nclose enemies flying backwards. The best part is that the cooldown is very\nshort, meaning liberal use of these boosts is encouraged.\n\nThere’s also ‘overdrive’, which is earned by pulling off successive,\naggressive kills – think Bulletstorm’s ‘Cool Kill’ mechanic, only much simpler\n– that sees the vibrant yellows and purples of the game’s advertising\nmaterials take over the game. Ranger is granted the equivalent of quad damage\nfor guns and abilities, leading to some very satisfying combat indeed.\n\nIt was hard to gauge the abilities of the enemy AI, but in this demo they did\nhave a tendency to attack in numbers. And with braun rather than brains,\nrunning straight at you hoping to kill by swarming rather than flanking.\n\nWhat segregates Rage 2 from most other shooters is that enemies take a decent\namount of damage before going down. I hit one guy with ‘shatter’ point-blank,\nonly to see him ragdoll behind some debris, dust himself off, and get right\nback to shooting me in the face. Once your brain adjusts to this way of\nplaying, it’s a fun ride knowing you can plough hundreds of bullets into each\nbaddy.\n\nThe demo was excellent fun with incredibly intense combat, but being an E3\nsnippet, it was very brief. However, there were still a couple of niggles,\nwhich I hope will be improved. The ‘slam’ ability sees Ranger Walker jump in a\nsemi-circle curve, which limits your ability to see where he’s landing once\nairborne. It would be way more beneficial for Walker to jump in a more\ntriangular arc, perhaps with an ever-so-slight pause at the peak of the jump\nto pick the most efficient landing spot.\n\n**Related:**[ **Forza Horizon 4\nReview**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/forza-horizon-4)\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nShatter’s ability also has a limited range that either works, or does\nabsolutely nothing. It would be nice if there were a middle-ground, where\nenemies were staggered a little to let you know you weren’t close enough, but\ngave enough time to make up for your mess-up and bring your gun back up to\nland a follow-up strike.\n\nYou can also do a running slide, but landing this into enemies does no damage.\nIn a world where you’re supposed to dish out death and destruction in combat,\nan over-the-top slide tackle would feel right at home.\n\nThese, however, are all minor gameplay niggles, where minor additions and\ntweaks would brush up what is already a very refined and enjoyable shooting\nsystem. I’m very hopeful that the driving delivers a similar level of fun, and\nconsidering what Avalanche has previously proved with Mad Max, I’m fully\nconfident in this happening.\n\nIt is, however, the great enigma for this game. I’ve seen but one small\nsection of a much greater game. I’m so interested to see everything else this\ngame has to offer.\n\n## First impressions\n\nCombining the open-world creativity and mechanical design of Avalanche, with\nthe first-person shooter mechanics of id Software, has all the potential of a\nmatch made in heaven. Getting the chance to play some of id’s mechanics in\nAvalanche’s world gave me a brief glimpse of this potential, and now I need to\nplay more. I just hope this game arrives early next year and doesn’t leave me\nwaiting too long.\n\n**Excited about Rage 2? Let us know on Facebook and Twitter @trustedreviews.**\n\n"}
