With\na more luxurious body and amped-up internals, the Land Rover Discovery is an\nextreme bit of kit. So what does that make Land Rover’s latest SUV?\n\nAmidst the madness of this year’s [Frankfurt Motor\nShow](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iaa-2017-frankfurt-motor-show-news-\ncars-concept-dates-3285246), Land Rover unveiled what it calls the “pinnacle\nof the Discovery family”. The Land Rover Discovery SVX is described as the\n“ultimate all-terrain Discovery”, and is the first Land Rover ever to bear the\n“SVX” moniker.\n\nCheck it out:\n\nIt features a huge 525hp 5.0-litre supercharged V8 petrol powertrain, and\ncomes with a number of enhancements over the standard Discovery. For instance,\nit’s got increased ground clearance, body and suspension lifts, greater wheel\narticulation, and huge 815mm all-terrain tyres – yes, that’s nearly a metre in\ndiameter.\n\nIt’s being built by Jaguar Land Rover’s secret Special Vehicle Operations\n(SVO) team, which are responsible for some of the most hardcore JLR motors to\ndate – including the [Jaguar F-Type\nSVR](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/jaguar-and-gopro-have-built-the-\nultimate-dash-cam-setup-2951601) and the upcoming all-electric [Jaguar I-Pace\neTrophy](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/jaguar-race-series-3286260) race\ncar.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: Jaguar Land Rover\n\nSpeaking about the news, John Edwards, Managing Director of Jaguar Land Rover\nSpecial Operations, said: “SVO designers and engineers are embedded within the\nLand Rover team and have unleashed their own passion for adventure to create\nanother truly desirable and versatile vehicle in the Land Rover line-up.”\n\nThe Discovery SVX also features a Hydraulic Active Roll Control (H-ARC)\nsystem, which Land Rover says offers increased wheel articulation and improved\nbody control, purportedly “enhancing extreme off-road traction, while also\nreducing body roll” for a smoother drive overall.\n\nOh, and it was potentially inspired by a goat:\n\nThere’s an eight-speed Automatic Transmission with twin-speed transfer box, as\nwell as all the usual dynamic Discovery features, including:\n\n  * Terrain Response 2\n  * Hill Descent Control\n  * Electronic Traction Control\n  * Adaptive Dynamics\n  * Dynamic Stability Control\n  * All-Terrain Progress Control\n  * Electric Power-Assisted Steering\n\nThe exterior design is also slightly more aggressive than the Land Rover\nDiscovery proper, with unique front and rear bumpers with protective skid\nplates, as well as exposed ‘Rush Orange’-finished metal recovery eyes. You can\nalso get the car in an exclusive satin Tectonic Grey paint finish, which\nfeatures a combination of Lunar and Light Oyster with Rush orange accents\ninside, and ‘X’ logo perforations on the SVX-branded seats.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: Jaguar Land Rover\n\n“The combination of design excellence and engineering integrity inherent in\nevery Land Rover is the foundation of everything we do,” said Gerry McGovern,\nLand Rover’s Chief Design Officer. “The Discovery SVX reinforces Land Rover’s\nunrivalled reputation for building vehicles with true all-terrain capability\nfor customers who desire the ultimate in off-road performance.”\n\nUnfortunately, there’s no word on pricing or release just yet, but given that\nthe new Land Rover Discovery starts at £43,495, you can bet the SVX variant\nwill be much pricier.\n\n**Related:[Range Rover Velar](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/range-rover-\nvelar-2017-price-release-date-specs-features-preview-3068648)**\n\n**What do you make of the new Land Rover Discovery SVX?
