Given the updates made\nto the [Galaxy Note 4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-\nnote-4-review), however, the S6 is expected to make the jump to a 2560 x 1440\npixel QHD display and a more premium, metal design.\n\nAs well as being a common reference to something new and innovative, the\nGalaxy S6’s ‘Project Zero’ codename is a step away from Samsung’s past,\nalphabetised, naming structures.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nWith the [Galaxy S5](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-s5-review)\nwas referred to as Project K, the S4 and [Note\n3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-note-3-review) original did\nthe internal rounds under the respective monikers of Project J and Project H.\n\nA major refresh is needed for Samsung’s flagship phone line. With the S5\nhaving been seen as something of a minor improvement over the S4, the\ncompany’s handset sales and subsequent profits have slumped massively in 2014.\n\nAlthough the Galaxy S6 is not expected to launch until early 2015, this is far\nfrom the first time the phone has been teased.\n\nRecent S6 rumours have pointed to the phone landing during MWC 2015 next March\nwith Android 5.0 Lollipop and a 20-megapixel camera in tow.\n\nAs you might expect, Samsung has yet to offer any official word on the\nexistence of the S6.\n\n**Read More:** [iPhone 6\nreview](https://www.trustedreviews.com/iphone-6-review)\n\n"}
