It’s since been\nreplaced by the [Apple Watch Series\n3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/apple-watch-3) but is still widely\non sale.\n\nThe original [Apple Watch](https://www.trustedreviews.com/apple-watch-review)\nwas Apple’s first draft at a wearable, and plenty bought into the promise of a\nphone on your wrist. At _Trusted Reviews_ we liked the look of it, but\nstruggled to understand its purpose: It had health and fitness elements, but\nthey were limited, and it didn’t offer water-resistance. In addition, the\nwatchOS software was tricky to use, glitchy, and just didn’t do much.\nInteresting third-party apps were lacking at the time, too.\n\n### Best Currys Apple Watch Series 3 Deals\n\n[](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1599&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-\ntechdeals-applewatch&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fgbuk%2Fsmart-\ntech%2Fsmart-tech%2Fsmart-watches-and-fitness%2Fsmart-watches%2Fapple-watch-\nseries-3-cellular-black-38-mm-10170112-pdt.html)\n\n[](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1599&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-\ntechdeals-applewatch&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fgbuk%2Fsmart-\ntech%2Fsmart-tech%2Fsmart-watches-and-fitness%2Fsmart-watches%2Fapple-watch-\nseries-3-cellular-black-38-mm-10170112-pdt.html)\n\n###\n\n[ Apple Watch Series 3 38mm GPS + LTE\n\n](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1599&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-\ntechdeals-applewatch&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fgbuk%2Fsmart-\ntech%2Fsmart-tech%2Fsmart-watches-and-fitness%2Fsmart-watches%2Fapple-watch-\nseries-3-cellular-black-38-mm-10170112-pdt.html)\n\nThe latest Apple Watch Series 3 complete with LTE connectivity in 38mm size.\n\n[Currys\n\n](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1599&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-\ntechdeals-applewatch&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fgbuk%2Fsmart-\ntech%2Fsmart-tech%2Fsmart-watches-and-fitness%2Fsmart-watches%2Fapple-watch-\nseries-3-cellular-black-38-mm-10170112-pdt.html)\n\n|\n\nNow £399\n\n[View\nDeal](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1599&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-\ntechdeals-applewatch&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fgbuk%2Fsmart-\ntech%2Fsmart-tech%2Fsmart-watches-and-fitness%2Fsmart-watches%2Fapple-watch-\nseries-3-cellular-black-38-mm-10170112-pdt.html)\n\nNow £399\n\n|\n\n[Currys\n\n](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1599&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-\ntechdeals-applewatch&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fgbuk%2Fsmart-\ntech%2Fsmart-tech%2Fsmart-watches-and-fitness%2Fsmart-watches%2Fapple-watch-\nseries-3-cellular-black-38-mm-10170112-pdt.html)\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=1599&clickref=tr-\napplewatch&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fgbuk%2Fsmart-tech%2Fsmart-\ntech%2Fsmart-watches-and-fitness%2Fsmart-watches%2Fapple-watch-\nseries-3-cellular-black-42-mm-10170117-pdt.html%3Fintcmpid%3Ddisplay~RR)\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=1599&clickref=tr-\napplewatch&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fgbuk%2Fsmart-tech%2Fsmart-\ntech%2Fsmart-watches-and-fitness%2Fsmart-watches%2Fapple-watch-\nseries-3-cellular-black-42-mm-10170117-pdt.html%3Fintcmpid%3Ddisplay~RR)\n\n###\n\n[Apple Watch Series 3 42mm GPS + LTE\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=1599&clickref=tr-\napplewatch&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fgbuk%2Fsmart-tech%2Fsmart-\ntech%2Fsmart-watches-and-fitness%2Fsmart-watches%2Fapple-watch-\nseries-3-cellular-black-42-mm-10170117-pdt.html%3Fintcmpid%3Ddisplay~RR)\n\nThe latest Apple Watch Series 3 complete with LTE connectivity in 42mm size.\n\n[currys\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=1599&clickref=tr-\napplewatch&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fgbuk%2Fsmart-tech%2Fsmart-\ntech%2Fsmart-watches-and-fitness%2Fsmart-watches%2Fapple-watch-\nseries-3-cellular-black-42-mm-10170117-pdt.html%3Fintcmpid%3Ddisplay~RR)\n\n|\n\n£429.00\n\n[View\nDeal](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=1599&clickref=tr-\napplewatch&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fgbuk%2Fsmart-tech%2Fsmart-\ntech%2Fsmart-watches-and-fitness%2Fsmart-watches%2Fapple-watch-\nseries-3-cellular-black-42-mm-10170117-pdt.html%3Fintcmpid%3Ddisplay~RR)\n\n£429.00\n\n|\n\n[currys\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=1599&clickref=tr-\napplewatch&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fgbuk%2Fsmart-tech%2Fsmart-\ntech%2Fsmart-watches-and-fitness%2Fsmart-watches%2Fapple-watch-\nseries-3-cellular-black-42-mm-10170117-pdt.html%3Fintcmpid%3Ddisplay~RR)\n\nThere are clear parallels to be drawn between the Apple Watch and the very\nfirst iPhone that was released almost a decade ago, which evolved into a\nsuperb product.\n\nWhile the [iPhone 7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/iphone-7-review) didn’t\nmeet our high expectations of it, the Apple Watch 2 finally has. All our\nconcerns about the original have been addressed: watchOS is now intuitive and\nuseful having had a number of updates; there are plenty of compatible apps;\nand the Apple Watch 2 is now properly water-resistant.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nApple recently released the [watchOS\n4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-watchos-4-new-features-release-\ndate-download) operating system update for the Apple Watch 2. This brought\nwith it a number of refinements and improvements, including a new Siri watch\nface, which uses Siri’s artificial intelligence to proactively bring useful\ninformation to your attention. There are also new Toy Story-themed watch\nfaces, joining Mickey and Minnie Mouse.\n\nThen there are improvements to the Activity app, including monthly goals and\nthe ability to add additional exercises to the same workout, which is useful\nfor triathletes and circuit trainers. There’s also new support for High\nIntensity Interval Training (HIIT).\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nApple has added support for a raft of new activities and sports, including\nactivities such as baseball, bowling and functional strength training.\n\nA new Heart Rate app is also designed to make even more use of the optical\nheart rate monitor on the back of the Apple Watch. The new dedicated app will\nlet you see your recovery and resting heart rate, and the Apple Watch will now\nalso keep an eye on your heart rhythm, as well as letting you know of an\nescalated heart rates when not exercising. This is all part of a new [Apple\nHeart Study](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-watch-apple-heart-\nstudy-3286510), which could make strides in gaining better understanding of\nheart conditions.\n\n**Related:[Apple Watch 3 vs Apple Watch\n2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-watch-3-vs-apple-\nwatch-2-3286324)**\n\nNow that the Apple Watch 2 has been superseded by the [Apple Watch Series\n3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-watch-3-release-date-\nseries-3-rumours-features-price-3196092), it can often be found for a\ndiscounted rate so it could well be a viable option if you don’t want to spend\nas much money for the newer model. It remains a top-notch smartwatch overall.\n\n## Apple Watch 2 – Design\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 2 looks almost identical to the original, and I don’t\nmind that at all. This remains my favourite smartwatch when it comes to looks,\nparticularly since it isn’t as chunky as rival watches. It helps that I prefer\nsquare watches; those who prefer round ones might not be as kind.  \n![Apple Watch 2\n11](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \nThe Watch 2 is a fraction thicker than the previous Watch, but not enough that\nyou’d notice without seeing the two next to each other. The square screen with\nrounded glass edges make it simple to swipe up, down, left and right from the\nedge to provide additional shortcuts, and the rotating Digital Crown still\nworks well as a method of zooming in and out, and general navigation.\n\nThe button just beneath the Digital Crown has been re-appropriated from a\nuseless shortcut to contacts and on/off switch to a much more engaging way to\nscroll through the new apps dock (more details to follow).\n\nYou can opt for either the stainless steel or, slightly cheaper, aluminium\nchassis, and one of two sizes: 38mm and 42mm. The Series 2 is available in a\nrange of colours: Gold, Rose Gold, Space Grey and Silver. This time there’s no\nexpensive gold-plated model.  \n![Apple Watch 2\n3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)  \nInstead, Apple has created a beautiful white ceramic smartwatch. The ceramic\ncast is treated at length at high temperature before it’s polished smooth. Not\nonly does it look super-attractive, it’s four times tougher than the stainless\nsteel model.\n\nStanding out from the crowd does come at a price, though. The ceramic Apple\nWatch Edition costs more than three times as much as the standard versions –\nthe 38mm one setting you back a cool £1,249.\n\nSuffice to say, it isn’t necessary to spend such an amount for an Apple Watch\nthat’s “tough”. I’ve dropped my aluminium Apple Watch on several occasions and\nregularly whack it against door frames; it doesn’t have a single scratch on\nthe screen or body.\n\nThe headline feature for the Apple Watch 2 is water-resistance. Not only will\nit survive a brief dunk in the bath, it’s now fit for the sea. Apple claims it\ncan withstand up to 50m of water – although we wouldn’t advise that you go\nscuba-diving with it just yet. It’s meant to survive the rigours of arms\nswinging through water, as opposed to being plunged into the depths.\n\n**Related:[Best smartwatch](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-\nsmartwatch_round-up)**  \n![Apple Watch Series 2\n13](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \nAn Apple representative explained to _TrustedReviews_ that the Apple Watch 2\nis fit for swimming in a pool for as long as you want, but can also deal with\nseawater. It was tested on hundreds of swimmers before release, and it\nprovides accurate exercise readings as well as surviving the wet stuff without\nany bother.\n\nThe screen locks when under water and so won’t be usable, but it will continue\nto track activity. Once out of the water, the Apple Watch Series 2 performs a\nlittle party piece to rid the water from its speaker grilles: it plays sound\nat various volumes and frequencies to expel liquid like a clam.  \n![Apple Watch 2\n47](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \nThere’s a wide range of straps available for the Series 2, both from Apple and\nthird parties – with an even bigger selection on offer than before – and\nthey’re the best way of making an Apple Watch “yours”. As well as the\nrelationship with luxury brand Hermès, Apple has also joined forces with Nike\nto launch the Apple Watch Nike+. This comes with a special strap, with\ncompression-moulded perforations to make it more breathable – ideal for\nathletes – along with some exclusive Nike watch faces and apps pre-installed.  \n**  \nRelated:[Best Apple Watch apps](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\napple-watch-apps)**\n\nFor those who intend to swim regularly with the Apple Watch 2 I’d recommend a\nsilicone strap, rather than the metal or nylon options. The Sports strap\ndoesn’t retain any water, so you won’t be left with a damp wrist all day after\na brief plunge and are more comfortable as a result.\n\n[ Next  \nScreen and Speaker ](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/apple-\nwatch-2-screen-and-speaker-page-2)\n\n"}
