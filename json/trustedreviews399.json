We’ve\nrounded up the best contract deals.**\n\nEven at just over a year old, the [Samsung Galaxy\nS8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s8) still manages to\nstrut its stuff as one of the best smartphones on the market. We gave the S8 a\nfull five-star rating in our original review, owed to the phone’s gorgeous\nAMOLED “infinity display” and amazing 12MP camera that’s capable of taking\ndetailed shots.\n\nEssentially, the Galaxy S8 is still a fantastic phone that’s going to meet the\nneeds of most people. The better news is that as it’s now a little older, you\ncan pick one up for significantly less than some of 2018’s models. We’ve\nlisted a range of contract deals below and broken them down by data allowance.\n\n**Related:[Samsung Galaxy S8 vs Galaxy\nS9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s9-vs-\ngalaxy-s8-3402874)**\n\nIf you’re still curious to know more about the S8 itself then we recommend\nchecking out our comprehensive review and seeing for yourself why it is one of\nthe best modern smartphones you can buy.

As a general rule, the more you’re\nable to pay upfront, the less you’re going to be paying over the life of your\ncontract, which is typically 24 months.\n\nTo calculate your total cost of ownership (TCO), you simply need to multiply\nthe monthly cost by your contract duration, and then add the upfront cost.\n\nSo, for a theoretical contract of £100 upfront, £30 a month for 24 months you\nwould use the following:\n\n(24 x £30) + £100 = £820\n\nIt’s then worth looking at what the current SIM free cost of the phone you\nwant, which will help give you an idea of how much you’re spending on your\nactual mobile service. If you shop around, you can find that you’re actually\npaying very little for your phone tariff.\n\n### Work out how much data you need\n\nNowadays, the biggest commodity when it comes to a mobile phone contract is\nthe data, whereas in the past people might have looked at how many minutes and\ntexts they got as part of their package. Today, most contracts will give you\nmore call minutes and text messages than you’ll ever need, so don’t be easily\nwon over by thousands of minutes or even ‘unlimited’. The networks know you’re\nnever going to use them, so they can aim for the stars.\n\nMost of us browse social media and the web, and stream music and video from\nour phones. These all require data. While browsing web pages and Instagram\nwon’t use that much data, streaming video is the biggest user of data. So if\nyou’re planning on streaming lots of Netflix on the move, you’ll want to opt\nfor a plan that has more data. Moderate users should still get by with around\n8GB, but if you’re a particularly heavy user look for double digits.\n\nSimilarly, if you plan on tethering a second device, you’ll want more data.\nYou can use your phone as a mobile hotspot, letting you share your data\nconnection with other devices like tablets or laptops. Great for when you’re\naway from Wi-Fi and need to get online. But doing this can burn through your\ndata allowance rapidly. So go for a higher data package if this is you.\n\nFinally, compare packages. A lot of high data packages have exactly the same\ncost as lower data packages if you’re paying attention. There’s no reason not\nto go for the higher data package just in case you find yourself wanting that\nextra data.\n\n### How to choose the right mobile network\n\nEven if you’re pretty sure which network you’d like to go with when you\nupgrade, it’s always worth finding out what else the main networks are\noffering as part of their mobile contracts. You might find that there’s a free\nsubscription package, add-on or contract perk that completely changes your\nidea of what makes a good deal.\n\nHere’s our summary of the various benefits of the main mobile networks at the\nmoment to help you make the right choice.\n\n**Three**\n\nThree doesn’t do things by halves; its free Go Binge service is designed to\ncater for the Netflix addicts, serious music streamers and telly watchers\namong us. Go Binge gives you unlimited 4G streaming on apps like Netflix,\nDeezer, TVPlayer and SoundCloud without touching your personal data allowance.\nDetails [here](http://www.three.co.uk/go-binge/details#faq) on what contracts\nqualify for Go Binge.\n\nThere’s good news for holidaymakers, too. Three now offers ‘Feel at Home’\nroaming in 71 countries, which means you can seamlessly use your data\nallowance abroad.\n\n**EE**\n\nEE could well be the most popular UK mobile network, and it claims to have the\nbiggest 4G coverage of all the networks too. Perks with EE include three\nmonths of free BT Sports for watching sports like football and rugby, and six\nmonths of free Apple Music for pay monthly subscribers.\n\n**Vodafone**\n\nSavvy shoppers could save some pennies by picking a Vodafone deal that offers\na free subscription package. Certain Vodafone Red Entertainment plans throw in\na free subscription to the likes of Spotify, Now TV or Sky Sports Mobile TV.\nSome of those services are pricey when bought alone, so this could be a shrewd\nmove indeed.\n\nVodafone has also recently announced it’s massively expanding its roaming\noptions by adding 29 extra destinations that allows Red Entertainment plan\nsubscribers to use their home plan abroad in 77 countries. Considering using\nyour phone abroad could historically be seriously pricey, this is a very\nwelcome move and helps set Vodafone apart for frequent travellers.\n\n**O2**\n\nO2 offers a Priority Tickets service to its customers, dishing out tickets for\ngigs 48 hours before the rest of the country get a look-in.\n\nIt also offers its customers free access to certain public Wi-Fi networks\nacross the UK, as well as now supporting 75 countries for roaming.\n\nCustomers wanting more flexibility with their contract might like the\nnetwork’s O2 Refresh feature, which lets you upgrade after a year. It also\ncuts the price of your monthly bill once you’ve paid the cost of the phone.\n\n**iD**\n\niD is a budget friendly network launched by Carphone Warehouse, and we really\nlike its Data Rollover feature. If you haven’t used all of your mobile data by\nthe end of the month, it rolls over for you to use in the next month. Lovely.\n\n### Make sure you check mobile coverage\n\nNetwork coverage is an important factor worth considering before entering a\nnew contract. It’s no good having a shiny new Galaxy S8 if you’re struggling\nto get any reception where you use it most.\n\nBelow are the coverage checker pages for the major networks, simply plug in a\npost code and it will tell you what to expect around 4G and voice/text\ncoverage. We’d recommend checking both your home and work to start off.\n\n  * [O2 network coverage checker](https://www.o2.co.uk/coveragechecker)\n  * [Vodafone network coverage checker](https://www.vodafone.co.uk/explore/network/uk-coverage-map/index.htm)\n  * [EE network coverage checker](https://ee.co.uk/why-ee/mobile-coverage)\n  * [Three network coverage checker](http://www.three.co.uk/Discover/Network/Coverage)\n  * [iD network coverage checker](https://www.idmobile.co.uk/help-and-advice/uk-coverage-checker)\n\n### Use Wi-Fi Calling\n\nIf you’re in a location with bad network reception but has a Wi-Fi connection,\nthen Wi-Fi Calling can be a lifesaver. This uses Wi-Fi for your calls and text\nmessages, bypassing the need for cell reception. Your calls and messages still\ncome out of your regular tariff allowance. Just turn on Wi-Fi Calling in the\nsettings on your Galaxy S8. All of the big UK networks now support the\nfeature.\n\n### How to keep your old phone number\n\nEven if you move network providers, it doesn’t mean you have to tell everyone\nyou have a new phone number. Instead, you can bring your phone number with\nyou. That’s great news if it’s taken you years to memorise your phone number.\nTo do this, just contact your old provider and ask for your PAC code. You then\ngive this PAC code to your new network provider, which gives them permission\nto port your old phone number over.\n\n_We may earn a commission if you click a deal and buy an item.
