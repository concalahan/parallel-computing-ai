As soon as we’ve reviewed both products, we’ll update this\narticle with our final thoughts and testing.\n\n## Google Home Hub vs Echo Show – Design\n\nWhile the original Echo Show was rather utilitarian, the 2nd Generation\nproduct looks a lot neater. With a fabric rear cover, the new Echo Show feels\nmuch more like it’s been designed, and is far more stylish than the plastic\ncovered product of old. The simple wedge shape is neat, too, and you buy the\nproduct in black or white. At 246 x 174 x 107mm it’s not a bad size, either,\nconsidering there’s a 10.1-inch display.\n\n**Related:[Amazon Alexa guide](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/amazon-\nalexa-guide-3462356)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nYet, the Google Home Hub is a different product altogether. Its floating\ndisplay sits on a fabric base, similar to those used in the other products,\nincluding the Home Mini. The Home Hub is available in four colours: sand,\naqua, chalk and charcoal.\n\n![Google Home Hub\ncolours](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![ps1](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### PlayStation Classic: Sony releases complete list of 20 games on the\nconsole\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/playstation-classic-mini-release-date-\npreorder-3583798 \"PlayStation Classic: Sony releases complete list of 20 games\non the console\")\n\n  * [ ![Hive View Outdoor](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Hive View Outdoor security camera can catch burglars before they strike\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/hive-view-outdoor-security-\ncamera-3612152 \"Hive View Outdoor security camera can catch burglars before\nthey strike\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Apple Black Friday](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Best MacBook 2018: All the facts on Apple’s MacBook, Pro and Air lines\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-macbook-3527944 \"Best MacBook 2018:\nAll the facts on Apple’s MacBook, Pro and Air lines\")\n\n  * \n\nAt 179 x 118 x 67mm, the Home Hub is a touch smaller than the Echo Show,\nalthough that’s mostly down to the smaller 7-inch display. To our mind, the\nHome Hub nabs it on the looks front.\n\n## Google Home Hub vs Echo Show – Screen\n\nThe Echo Show 2nd Generation has a 10.1-inch touchscreen with a Full HD\nresolution. That’s a step up from the original screen and makes it a better\nchoice for watching streamed films and TV shows.\n\n**Related:[Google Home vs Amazon\nEcho](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-home-vs-amazon-\necho-2945424)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe Google Home Hub has a smaller 7-inch touchscreen display, but the\nresolution hasn’t been announced. The display has a light sensor in it and can\nadjust the colour temperature to match the ambient light using the Ambient EQ\nfeature.\n\n![Google Home\nHub](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nBoth devices can shut off the display at night, so you can have these smart\ndisplays in your bedroom without them waking you up.\n\n## Google Home Hub vs Echo Show – Cameras\n\nGoogle has decided not to put a camera in its Home Hub, citing privacy as the\nmain reason, so that people feel more comfortable placing its product in\nprivate places. Given the reaction to the [Facebook\nPortal](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/facebook-portal-smart-\nspeaker-3461010), you can’t help that think this was probably a wise move.\n\nAmazon has a 5-megapixel camera on the front of the Echo Show, which is used\nprimarily for video calling from Echo to Echo. If you like that kind of\nfeature, you’ll be glad of the camera. However, it would be nice if Amazon had\nincluded a shutter to physically block the stream.\n\n**Related:[Google Assistant\nguide](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/google-asssistant-guide-\nfeatures-entertainment-smart-home-and-more-3462823)**\n\n![Amazon Echo Show\ncalling](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Google Home Hub vs Echo Show – Features\n\nBoth devices can play video, although the approach is quite different. Amazon\nhas, of course, built-in compatibility with Amazon Prime Video, so you can\nbrowse and watch all of your streaming content. On the larger screen, this\ncontent looks far better and the Echo Show could be a handy secondary screen\nfor watching video.\n\nAmazon doesn’t have direct YouTube access, but that’s something that the\nGoogle Home Hub obviously has. This is more likely to make the Home Hub the\nbetter product for kitchen use, letting you watch recipe videos and the like.\n\nFor Photos, the Home Hub has the advantage, as it works with Google Photos,\neven cleverly showing only your good images, filtering out-of-focus and other\npoor-quality shots. The Amazon Echo Show supports Amazon Prime Photos, but far\nfewer people use this service.\n\nSmart assistant features are roughly similar across both products. They can\nboth read your calendar, give you weather reports, set multiple timers and the\nlike. Google still hasn’t said that it supports GSuite accounts (paid-for\nGmail), which is frustrating, as this is something that Amazon has supported\nsince day one.\n\nGoogle most likely has the advantage with the likes of Google Maps\nintegration, showing you on screen the best route to take. Amazon simply\ndoesn’t have access to a service of the same quality.\n\n## Google Home Hub vs Echo Show – Smart home control\n\nAmazon was the first company to add touch controls for smart devices, adding\ndirect control to the Alexa app. Rather than using your voice, you can use the\napp to turn on lights or adjust a thermostat’s temperature. Similar control\ncan now be performed from the Echo’s screen.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nGoogle was always playing catch-up but has managed that with the Home View. As\nwith Amazon’s solution, Home View lets you remote control your smart home\ndevices directly with touch. And, it’s not just on the Home Hub, as Home View\nwill be available in the Google Home app, too.\n\n![Google Home\nHub](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nGoogle has expanded its Nest integration. Now, when someone presses the [Nest\nHello](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nest-hello), the Home Hub can\nshow you the live video feed and let you respond with voice or quick\nresponses.\n\nAmazon has promised a similar feature for the Echo Show, with the [Ring Video\nDoorbell 2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/ring-video-doorbell-2) most\nlikely the first product to support it. However, it remains to be seen if the\nNest Hello will be compatible in the same way.\n\nThe Echo Show has a Zigbee smart home hub built-in, so you can connect smart\ndevices directly without the need for extra hubs. For example, you can add\nPhilips Hue bulbs without the need for a Hue Bridge. However, it remains to be\nseen how good the control is. When the [Echo\nPlus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/amazon-echo-plus) launched last\nyear with a Zigbee hub, Hue control lagged far behind that provided by the\nofficial Hue app.\n\n## Google Home Hub vs Echo Show – Early verdict\n\nAt £139 the Google Home Hub is considerably cheaper than the Echo Show. The\nprice difference is most likely due to the difference in screen size. As to\nwhich product is best, it’s the subtleties of use that really let us choose\nthe difference, so we’ll have to wait until we get final review products.\n\nWhat we can say at this point is that the Google Home Hub is really bringing\nthe fight to Amazon. With its lower price, great looks and improved smart home\ncontrol, Google is rapidly catching up with Amazon. Yet, the wide support that\nAlexa has and larger screen on the Echo Show are a potent combination.\n\n### Best Echo Show (2nd Gen) Deals\n\n[](http://geni.us/echoshow2)\n\n[](http://geni.us/echoshow2)\n\n###\n\n[All-New Echo Show (2nd Gen), Black + Free Philips Hue White Bulb E27\n\n](http://geni.us/echoshow2)\n\nThe Echo Show was always a great product but it was hindered by lacklustre\ndesign.
