Nintendo has confirmed that\nit’s**[ **Switch Online paid\nservice**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/nintendo-switch-online-3469385)\n**will be launching in the second half of September, bringing to an end the\nonline free-for-all of** ** _Mario Kart and Splatoon 2_**\n\n> The\n[#NintendoSwitchOnline](https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoSwitchOnline?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\npaid membership service will launch in the second half of September, providing\naccess to online play, Save Data Cloud backup in compatible games, and a\ngrowing library of NES titles with added online play.<https://t.co/R3Ftvxd8Ft>\n\n>\n\n> — Nintendo of Europe (@NintendoEurope) [August 10,\n2018](https://twitter.com/NintendoEurope/status/1027826911593025536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nNintendo has been promising the online service since last year, but only\nrevealed more details this year. In essence, it’s very similar to the services\nset up by rivals Microsoft and Sony for the\n[Xbox](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/xbox-one-x) and\n[PlayStation](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/ps4-pro) families. Users\npay a subscription, and in return can take part in online play, backup their\nsaved games to the cloud and enjoy a selection of free titles. Only, in this\ncase, Nintendo’s selection of free games currently only includes remastered\nNES games with added online play.\n\n**Related:**[ **Upcoming Nintendo Switch\ngames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/upcoming-nintendo-switch-\ngames-3522184)\n\nIn Nintendo’s defence, this considerably more meagre offering also comes at a\nmuch lower price. You can get one month’s access for £3.49/$3.99, three months\nfor £6.99/$7.99 or a whole year’s access to multiplayer Nintendo fun for\n£17.99/$19.99. That’s slightly less than half the cost of rival offerings.\n\nOf course, said rivals don’t just have the older free games to point to when\narguing about their value. There’s a real shortage of Switch games that\ncurrently support online play making it a slightly trickier sell. At the\nmoment, fans seem to be making do with [Mario Kart\n8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/mario-kart-8-deluxe),\n[_Fortnite_](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/fortnite-battle-royale)\nand [_Splatoon 2_](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/splatoon-2) , though\n[_Super Smash Bros Ultimate_](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/super-smash-\nbros-ultimate-release-date-gameplay-roster-stages-2949964) may well sell a few\nsubscriptions on its own.\n\n**Related:**[ **Best Nintendo Switch\ngames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/nintendo-switch-games-3435122)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: WhatsApp \n\n### The Facebook Effect: WhatsApp says ads coming to Status tab\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/whatsapp-advertisements-status-\ntab-3613630 \"The Facebook Effect: WhatsApp says ads coming to Status tab\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * \n\nWhen Switch Online is officially launched in the second half of September,\nfree online play will be a thing of the past, leaving current players with a\nsimple choice: stick to offline play, or pay up. Unfortunately, with _Super\nSmash Bros Ultimate_ launching in December, there won’t be time to try before\nthey buy.\n\n**Will you pay for Switch Online, or do you prefer your single-player gaming?\nLet us know with a quick message on Twitter to @TrustedReviews**\n\n"}
