Take the [Google Pixel\n3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-3), for example, which\nis pioneering genuinely innovative computational photography with features\nlike Super Res Zoom (a digital zoom that competes with optical zoom) and its\nforthcoming Night Sight mode.\n\nBut is the Google Pixel 3 really better than another smartphone photography\nheavyweight, the [Apple iPhone\nXS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xs)? After all, Apple is one\nof the main reasons why your old compact camera cries itself to sleep in your\ndrawer of forgotten gadgets.\n\nTo find out, we took both phones on a photographic assault course around\nLondon, with tests in five key areas: general shooting, portraits and selfies,\nzoom, low light and video.\n\nThis was a battle between their default, boxfresh shooting experiences, which\nmeant shooting in both phones’ equivalents of ‘auto HDR’ and their stock\ncamera apps.\n\nWe then reviewed the snaps on the phone screens and a calibrated monitor to\ncheck for mistakes (still quite common in these early days of computational\nphotography), along with colour, white balance, noise and dynamic range.\n\nIt was quite a contest – here’s how they got on…\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n**Related:**[Best photo editing\napps](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-photo-editing-apps-3486958)\n\n## Google Pixel 3 vs Apple iPhone XS: portrait mode\n\n![Google Pixel 3 vs iPhone\nXS](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe Google Pixel 3 (left) goes for a more contrasty, sharper look compared to\nthe warmer, softer Apple iPhone XS (right).\n\nOne of the biggest differences between the [Google Pixel\n3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-3) and [iPhone\nXS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xs) is in how they handle\npeople shots, at least in their default shooting modes.\n\nHere you can see that the Pixel 3 (left) goes for a cooler, more contrasty\nlook compared the iPhone XS’ warmer tones. Crop into the Pixel’s shot and you\ncan see that it does pick out some extra detail, although its aggressive\nsharpening can make it pretty unforgiving when it comes to blemishes (sorry,\nRyan).\n\nThe iPhone XS’ portrait mode is much smoother by comparison – this is more\ndown to its Smart HDR processing than any ‘beauty mode’ effect. Both phones\nuse HDR to merge multiple frames and balance exposure across the frame, but\nthe iPhone’s processing tends to err on the side of removing shadows and local\ncontrast, which makes faces look that bit flatter.\n\n![Google Pixel 3 vs iPhone\nXS](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe Pixel 3’s Portrait mode (left) is slightly underexposed here, but picks\nout more detail than the Apple iPhone XS.\n\nYou can see the same effects in the portrait shots above, with the iPhone XS\nagain going for a softer, warmer look. Both phones seem to have improved their\nedge detection for the fake bokeh, which aims to ape the background blur from\na fast lens. But while the Pixel 3 is generally more consistent with its cut-\nouts, the iPhone XS applies its bokeh effect in a more ‘realistic’ way with\ngradual blur rather than the more abrupt, cleaner look favoured by the Pixel.\n\nUltimately, both portrait modes have their flaws, but in a blind poll of the\n_Trusted Reviews_ office, 80% of voters favoured the more processed look of\nthe Pixel 3’s shots. That extra contrast and detail certainly makes its shots\nlook punchier on a phone screen and on social media, which is surely the\ndestination for most portrait mode snaps. First round to Google, then.\n\n**Portrait mode winner:** Google Pixel 3\n\n**Related:**[Best smartphones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nsmartphone-3431175)\n\n## Google Pixel 3 vs Apple iPhone XS: selfies\n\n![Google Pixel 3 vs iPhone\nXS](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe Pixel 3’s selfies (left) can overdo the sharpening on some occasions,\nwhile the iPhone XS (right) removes shadows and flattens faces a little.\n\nIt’s a similar story when it comes to both phones’ front-facing cameras – the\n[Google Pixel 3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-3) really\ngoes all-in on sharpness, while [iPhone\nXS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xs) selfies are much warmer\nand smoother.\n\nThat extra sharpness on the Pixel can almost give you plastic Lego hair in\ncertain lighting, which may or may not be your preferred look. By contrast,\nthe iPhone XS’ Smart HDR has again removed shadows and depth (no bad thing),\nwhile its bokeh effect is more like that of a real, fast lens.\n\nThe Pixel 3 has a crucial advantage though – a second, wide-angle lens on the\nfront that gives you the option of fitting a much bigger group of people into\nyour shot. Or, if you don’t have any friends like us, just more background\nscenery.\n\n![Google Pixel 3 vs iPhone\nXS](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIn even lighting, the Pixel 3’s contrasty selfies (left) have more punch than\nthe more true-to-life iPhone XS (right).\n\nIt’s the extra flexibility of that second lens, plus the added detail in its\nshots, that again gives the Pixel 3 the edge in our selfie book.\n\n**Selfie winner: Google Pixel 3**\n\n## Google Pixel 3 vs Apple iPhone XS: zoom\n\n![Google Pixel 3 vs iPhone\nXS](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nDespite using a new type of digital zoom rather than optical zoom, the Pixel 3\n(left) does surprisingly well at 2x zoom compared the iPhone’s dedicated 58mm\nlens.\n\nSo here’s an interesting round – it’s the [Google Pixel\n3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-3)‘s single lens\ndigital zoom versus the [iPhone\nXS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xs)‘ 2x optical zoom (from\nits second 58mm lens). Easy win for the iPhone, right? Surprisingly, it wasn’t\nquite as simple as that.\n\nOn the Pixel 3, Google has done something pretty miraculous in making a\ndigital zoom that you’ll actually want to use. To explain: digital has\ntraditionally just cropped into your image or attempted to recreate\ninformation that isn’t there. But the ‘Super Res Zoom’ that debuts on the\nPixel 3 instead takes 15 frames in a very quick burst, then uses your hand-\nshake and optical image stabilisation to do subtle micro shifts and move the\nlens around, so that extra detail can be localised on the sensor at a sub-\npixel level.\n\nClever stuff, but does it work? As you can see, it does very well compared to\nthe iPhone’s 2x optical zoom. In fact, it’s only when you really look closer\nwith a 100% crop (below) that the Pixel shot starts to break down and turn\ninto more of a painting than a photo. There’s certainly more detail and\nsharpness in the iPhone’s shot, but the Pixel isn’t miles off.\n\n**Related:**[Best travel cameras](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\ntravel-camera-3493068)\n\n![Google Pixel 3 vs iPhone\nXS](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThis 100% crop of the previous 2x zoom shot shows that the Pixel 3 (left) does\nstill lack detail and sharpness compared to the optical zoom of the iPhone XS\n(right).\n\nGoogle says that Super Res Zoom is “roughly competitive with 2x optical zoom”\nand that seems about right – it’s better than Pixel 2’s digital zoom and\ntechnically impressive, but not quite at optical level yet.\n\nThe results are pretty close when you venture into the dangerous waters of 8x\nzoom too…\n\n![Google Pixel 3 vs iPhone\nXS](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAt 8x zoom, both smartphones (Pixel 3 left, iPhone XS right) naturally\nstruggle with intricate patterns and detail.\n\nThe Pixel 3 starts to look more like a Prisma art filter when you look\nclosely, particularly in the low light zoom shot below, and there’s a little\nmoiré on the side of the Walkie Talkie building.\n\nBut the iPhone’s digital zoom starts to fall apart on close inspection too,\nparticularly in terms of noise. As clever as these phones are, 8x digital zoom\nis still very much for absolute emergencies.\n\n**Related:**[Best mirrorless\ncameras](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-mirrorless-cameras-3438977)\n\n![Google Pixel 3 vs iPhone\nXS](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAnother 8x zoom snap, which the iPhone XS (right) edges over Pixel 3’s\nartificial, oversharpened look (left).\n\nSo, full marks to Google for rebranding digital zoom as something we might\nactually use, but this round still goes to the iPhone and its trusty optical\nzoom.\n\n**Zoom winner:** Apple iPhone XS\n\n## Google Pixel 3 vs Apple iPhone XS: general shooting\n\n![Google Pixel 3 vs iPhone\nXS](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIn mixed lighting, the Pixel 3 (left) struggles with dynamic range compared to\nthe iPhone XS’s Smart HDR mode (right).\n\nStepping back from special modes and fancy computational zooms, how do the two\nphones fair in simple, point-and-shoot scenarios?\n\nAs the photo above shows, it depends very much on the lighting in your scene.\nIn mixed lighting, with dark and bright areas, the iPhone’s Smart HDR (right)\ntends to come out on top – it’s better exposed across the frame, whereas the\nPixel 3 has crushed the blacks, making the trees look more like silhouettes\nand the wall like it’s been built from dark matter.\n\n![Google Pixel 3 vs iPhone\nXS](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nUnlike the previous shot, the Pixel 3 (left) balances the exposure much better\nhere compared to the iPhone XS (right).\n\nGive the phones a balanced diet of more even light, though, and the [iPhone\nXS’](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xs) shots can start to look\nlittle flat and washed out.\n\nWhen the [Google Pixel 3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-\npixel-3) gets the exposure right, it just captures that bit more detail than\nthe iPhone too, as you can see in the 100% crop of that photo below. Ignore\nthe pesky flag in the iPhone’s shot, and you can see the extra detail the\nPixel manages to capture in the sculpture on the side of the building.\n\n![Google Pixel 3 vs iPhone\nXS](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThis 100% crop of the previous shot shows how much more detail the Pixel 3\n(left) resolves than the iPhone XS (right) in the wall’s sculpture.\n\nWith the results so dependent on lighting conditions and both phones scoring\nwinning shots, we’ll have to call this one an honourable draw.\n\n**General shooting winner:** Draw\n\n## Google Pixel 3 vs Apple iPhone XS: low light\n\n![Google Pixel 3 vs iPhone\nXS](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIn low light, the iPhone XS (right) favours a more true-to-life exposure than\nthe saturated look of the Pixel 3’s shot (left).\n\nAnd now we venture into the gloom. Not that this at all intimidates flagship\nsmartphones these days – the performance of both the [Google Pixel\n3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-3) and [iPhone\nXS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xs) in low light shooting is\npretty incredible.\n\nThe iPhone XS has a larger camera sensor than the iPhone X, and you can see\nthe benefit in its shot (above right). Its noise control is impressive, and\nit’s done a good job with balancing the exposure between the lights and\nshadows.\n\nUnfortunately it’s run into a low light ninja in the form of the Pixel 3.\nOkay, the lights are little more blown out and its colour might be too\noversaturated for some, but the levels of detail and sharpness are superb for\na smartphone night shot.\n\nThe iPhone’s colour and white balance might be more true to the real scene,\nbut there’s no doubting which one stands out more on a phone screen or\nInstagram.\n\n**Related:**[Best mirrorless\ncameras](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-mirrorless-cameras-3438977)\n\n![Google Pixel 3 vs iPhone\nXS](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe iPhone XS’s white balance (right) is more accurate here, but the Pixel 3\n(left) pulls out much more detail from the shadows.\n\nThis shot again shows the two phones’ different low light approaches. The\niPhone XS (right) has a more ‘accurate’ white balance that’s close to how the\nscene looked in real life, with the Pixel taking a much cooler route.\n\nBut the Pixel 3’s HDR skills again simply reveal more of the scene, in both\nthe road and in the barber shop’s sign. As the shot below shows, it’s capable\nof teasing out a little more detail from gloomy scenes too – check out the\ncrop from one of the office windows further down, and you can make out the\ncompany name on the cardboard box in the Pixel’s shot. A truly incredible\nachievement for a handheld night shot.\n\n![Google Pixel 3 vs iPhone\nXS](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThis shot at dusk shows the differences between the auto white balance of the\nPixel 3 (left) and iPhone XS (right).\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIn this 100% crop of the previous shot, the Pixel 3 (left) manages to make the\nbox’s logo decipherable, which is impressive for a handheld night shot.\n\n## Google Pixel 3 vs Apple iPhone XS: video\n\nThe [iPhone XS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xs) certainly\nhas the edge over the [Google Pixel\n3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-3) when it comes to\nvideo recording specs – it can record 4K up to 60fps (rather than 30fps on the\nPixel 3), and you can use its 2x optical zoom when shooting video too.\n\nThe colour and dynamic range is impressive, particularly for a smartphone, as\nis the sound from its stereo mics. The Pixel’s combination of optical and\nelectronic stabilisation works well, but overall the sharpness and sound\nquality is a little behind the iPhone.\n\nIt’s a similar story when it comes to the front-facing cameras, with the Pixel\nlet down by tinny sound quality that pretty much rules it out of vlogging\nduty.\n\n**Video winner:** Apple iPhone XS\n\n**Related:**[Best video editing\napps](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-video-editing-apps-3603896)\n\n## Google Pixel 3 vs Apple iPhone XS: which smartphone has the best camera?\n\n![Google Pixel 3 vs iPhone\nXS](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAnd the answer is (drum roll)…it depends what you’re shooting.\n\nThat might sound like a cop out, but if there’s one thing this series of tests\nrevealed it’s that these phones (and more specifically, their HDR modes)\nthrive in different situations.\n\nFor daytime scenes with mixed lighting, panoramas, short zooms (up to 2x zoom)\nand macro close-ups, the [iPhone\nXS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xs) wins out. Its photos\ngenerally have a more true-to-life look in terms of white balance and colour,\nand it’s also definitely the best for video.\n\nBut overall I’d say the [Google Pixel\n3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-3) is the slightly\nbetter all-rounder for still photos. In even light and low light, it just\nshoots brighter, crisper and more detailed photos. Its low light performance\nis already pretty incredible, and there’s still its promising Night Sight mode\nto come.\n\nYou could argue that those who prefer more ‘camera-like’ photos will favour\nthe iPhone’s slightly more restrained processing. But it’s fair to say that\nmost people, as shown by the popularity of the Pixel’s Portrait mode in our\nblind office test, prefer their smartphones to shoot punchy photos that look\ngreat on a phone screen or social media. And for that, the Pixel 3 has the\nedge.\n\n**What do you think, did you prefer the Pixel 3 photos or the iPhone XS snaps\nin our tests? Drop us a line @TrustedReviews on Twitter.**\n\n"}
