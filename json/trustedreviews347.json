The highlights for us were the\nShadow of the Colossus remake and Monster Hunter finally coming to PS4. We\nwould have loved to see more solid release dates for first-party exclusives,\nthough.  \n**  \n _TrustedReviews_ compiled all the news, announcements and trailers you might\nneed from Sony’s E3 2017 press conference. Read on to find out more.\n\n## Sony E3 press conference – As it happened\n\n**0254:** Insomniac Games’ [Spider-\nMan](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/spider-man-ps4-release-date-trailer-\ngameplay-pre-order) adaptation is closing the show this year with an extensive\ngameplay demo.
