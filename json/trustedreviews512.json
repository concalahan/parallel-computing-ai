The promotion will begin tomorrow\n(November 1) and last until the end of the year.\n\nSpotify Premium for Family costs $14.99 a month and enables up to six family\nmembers in the same household to have individual family accounts with their\nown playlists and recommendations.\n\nGiven the Google Assistant can be trained to recognise individual family\nmember’s voices, the Google Home Mini is a great companion for summoning\neveryone’s playlists. So, younger members of the household will be able to say\n“OK Google, play my Discover Weekly playlist” without dad’s Phil Collins mix\ncoming on.\n\nUnfortunately, Spotify told _Trusted Review_ the offer will not be available\nto UK Family subscribers.\n\n**Related:[Google Home vs Amazon\nEcho](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-home-vs-amazon-\necho-2945424)**\n\n“We’re excited to be partnering with Google Home to bring the magic of voice\nto our Spotify Premium Family subscribers.
