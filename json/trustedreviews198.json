It has a pair of cameras\non its rear that are arranged vertically (both are 12 megapixel), and the\nfront of the Explorer Edition of the phone features a 20MP camera equipped\nwith infrared face unlocking technology (which sounds a lot like Apple’s Face\nID to us).\n\nElsewhere, the phone is every bit the flagship Android device we’d expect in\n2018. It’s got Qualcomm’s top of the line [Snapdragon\n845](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/snapdragon-845-benchmark-phones-\nspeed-3390981) chip, and a 6.21-inch AMOLED display.\n\nIn terms of software, the phone will run Xiaomi’s MIUI 10 skin on top of\nAndroid (which we’ve got our fingers crossed is version Oreo, but Xiaomi\nwasn’t able to officially confirm this) and Xiaomi is also packing in its own\nXiao Ai voice assistant.\n\nThe phone will be available in three different versions; a compact Xiaomi Mi 8\nSE , the standard Mi 8, and a premium Mi 8 Explorer Edition – the trio\nostensibly rivalling the [iPhone\nSE](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-se), [iPhone\n8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-8) and iPhone X,\nrespectively.\n\nBefore we get into the nitty gritty differences between the three, though,\nhere’s the basic info.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe Explorer Edition features a glass back so you can see the phone’s\ninternals\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n## Xiaomi Mi 8 release date\n\nThe Xiaomi Mi 8 is due to release in China on June 5, while the compact Mi 8\nSE is due to be released a couple of days later on June 8.\n\nMeanwhile the Mi 8 Explorer Edition is due to be launched later, although\nXiaomi has so far not announced an exact release date.\n\n## Is the Xiaomi Mi 8 coming the UK?\n\nSo far, we haven’t seen any details about an official launch in the UK.\n\n## Xiaomi Mi 8 price\n\nIn the absence of a full UK release date announcement, we don’t have any\nofficial word on what the price might be over here.\n\nInstead, we’re forced to guess what the price will be based off of the Chinese\npricing. The standard Mi 8 will be priced at 2699 Chinese yuan, which works\nout at around £316.\n\nMeanwhile, the more premium Explorer edition will cost 3699 yuan, or\napproximately £433.\n\nFinally, the compact Mi 8 SE is unsurprisingly the cheapest of the three at\n1799 yuan, or £210.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Xiaomi Mi 8 vs SE vs Explorer Edition: What’s the difference?\n\nThe Xiaomi Mi 8 SE is the cheapest and smallest of the three handsets. It has\na 5.88-inch AMOLED screen compared to the 6.21-inch screen of the other two\ndevices, and downgrades the processor from a Snapdragon 845 to the newly\nannounced mid-range [Snapdragon\n710](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/snapdragon-710-specs-phones-\nbenchmarks-3476850).\n\nOther than that, the SE is every bit the same phone as the Mi 8 and Mi 8\nExplorer edition, with the same software, cameras, and dual-frequency GPS.\n\nMeanwhile the Explorer Edition is the premium specced handset out of the\nthree, with a transparent glass rear which shows off the device’s internals.\nThis means that there’s no space on the back for a rear-mounted fingerprint\nscanner, so instead the phone will be equipped with an under-display\nfingerprint scanner from Synaptic.\n\nThere’s a lot going on with the new phones, and we’ll be very interested to\nsee if they make their way to the west. If they can bring along their budget\nprice tags then they could be very tempting indeed.\n\n**Which of the new Xiaomi Mi 8 handsets are you most tempted by?
