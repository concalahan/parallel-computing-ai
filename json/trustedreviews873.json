{"result": 0, "title": "FIFA 19 Review | Trusted Reviews", "description": "* ![fifa 19]()Like the gameplay, the visuals have received minor tweaks rather thanwholesale changes. There’s more personality to those in the crowds and you’llsee them waving crested flags or taking selfies, while player faces haveslightly more detail and movement. Lighting in the accurately representedstadiums looks fantastic when playing in HDR, but I have noticed some dropped-frames on a [PS4 Pro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/ps4-pro) whenplaying in arenas that are particularly detailed in rainy situations.There are two other significant aspects of FIFA 19 that I haven’t touched uponyet: the final chapter in the story-driven ‘The Journey’ campaign, and theuber-addictive Ultimate Team.The Journey surprised when it debuted a few years back with how good it was,and last year’s follow-up was equally engrossing (even if I felt it was a goodway to end the series). For this final chapter EA Sports has used those newUEFA licenses to full effect. ‘The Journey: Champions’ continues Alex Hunter’sjourney with a Champions League run, and it adds in a few more playablecharacters for variety.Alex is still the focus, and you can ignore the others completely if you wish,but being able to switch between his half-sister Kim and friend Danny freshensup the formula.It’s still trashy, cheesy, straight-to-DVD-quality writing and dialoguethroughout. Yet it’s fun to play and introduces some fun mini-games anddecisions to make. EA has really hit on something with this story, and it willbe interesting to see where it goes next.Ultimate Team returns, obviously, and it will likely be the mode used most byhardcore fans. It’s very much the same as before and will likely eat away atyour wallet if you get really stuck in.## **Verdict**FIFA 19 is a great game, packed with plenty of detail. It isn’t a huge stepforward in terms of raw gameplay, but the sheer amount of stuff to do willmean you keep coming back for more.## Score"}
