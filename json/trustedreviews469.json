Features like copy and paste and drag and drop can also be amended to\nwork within the macOS environment.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nApple says the addition of News, Stocks, Voice Memos and Home to macOS Mojave\nis just ‘phase 1’ of a multi-year project. The company says third-party\ndevelopers will be able to start porting their iOS apps to macOS in 2019, so\nit’ll be a while before every day Mac users see some of their favourite apps\nshow up on the Mac.\n\n## macOS and iOS merger?\n\nThe company also definitively stated it would not be merging iOS and macOS\ninto one operating system.\n\nInstead it believes the continued questions on the subject are related to\nuniversal apps, rather than users seeking an all-encompassing operating\nsystem, for mobile and desktop devices.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe ability for developers to bring the best of the iOS App Store to macOS,\nalong with the redesigned macOS App Store should go a long way to satisfying\nMac customers, while making it easier for developers to broaden their revenue\nstreams.\n\n**Are you excited by the possibility of iOS apps coming to the Mac?
