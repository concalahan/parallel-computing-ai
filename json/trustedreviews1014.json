Headlining the selection is a duo\nof new phones, both of which have been heavily leaked in recent months.\n\nThe [Google Pixel 3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-3)\nand [Pixel 3 XL](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-3-xl) are\nGoogle’s new flagship devices, replacing the [Pixel\n2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-2) and [Pixel 2\nXL](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-2-xl), offering up\nenticing new competition against the [iPhone\nXS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xs), [Samsung Galaxy Note\n9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-9) and upcoming\n[Huawei Mate 20](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/huawei-\nmate-20-pro-3486661) and [OnePlus\n6T](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/oneplus-6t-release-date-3525032).\n\nBut what’s different between the two phones? Let’s compare and have an in-\ndepth look.\n\n## **Pixel 3 vs Pixel 3 XL – Do they look the same?**\n\nNo, these two phones do not look alike. Unlike the iPhone XS and iPhone XS\nMax, the two versions of Google’s flagship look noticeably different.\n\nThe Pixel 3 XL mimics the iPhone XS and [Huawei P20\nPro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/huawei-p20-pro) by having a notch\nat the top of the display. The notch here houses the front speaker and twin\nfront cameras, however, it certainly seems larger than other notches we’ve\nseen. It dips down quite far into the display and we can see this being\ndisruptive if you use your phone a lot for video. It does, however, allow the\nbezel to be much thinner around the rest of the device.\n\n![google pixel 3 xl\nleak](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nBelow the screen, on the Pixel 3 XL you’ll find a small chin housing the\nsecond front speaker.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nSwitch over to the Pixel 3, though, and you’ll find a phone that looks a lot\nmore like the Pixel 2 XL from last year. It ditches the 16:9 display of the\nPixel 2 for an 18:9 one, reducing the bezel in the process. It looks a lot\nmore modern and will likely appeal to those put off by the notch on the XL\nversion.\n\nFlip the phones over and they look a lot more alike. Both have glass backs\nwith a slight two-tone colouring and a fingerprint sensor in the middle.\nNeither boast headphone jacks, though – something that’s hardly a surprise\nafter the Pixel 2 ditched it last year. New for these phones though is an\nincluded pair of USB–C headphones.\n\nBoth phones are [IP68](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/what-is-ip68-ip-\nratings-explained-2947135) rated and support wireless charging through the Qi\nstandard.\n\n## **Pixel 3 vs Pixel 3 XL – Which one is more powerful?**\n\nThese two phones look quite different from one another, however on the inside\nthey’re very similar. This is an approach we like as you’re not sacrificing\n_too_ much if you prefer smaller or larger phones.\n\nBoth the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL are powered by the Snapdragon 845 chipset\npaired with 4GB RAM. Considering the majority of other Android flagship phones\nare now boasting either 6GB RAM or 8GB RAM it does seem odd Google is sticking\nwith 4GB. It seemed fine and fast during our initial play with – but we’ll\nneed to spend more time with it to judge it properly.\n\nStorage starts at 64GB, with a 128GB option too, and there remains no microSD\ncard. Choose your storage wisely when you buy this phone. The only additional\nstorage given is free uploads of your photos and videos through the Google\nPhotos app.\n\nOther specs include a 6.3-inch, 2960 x 1440 OLED display on the Pixel 3 XL,\nand a 5.5-inch FHD+ OLED on the regular Pixel 3. Both displays support HDR – a\nfirst for the Pixel series.\n\n**Related:[Best smartphones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nsmartphone-3431175)**\n\n![Pixel 2\ncamera](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: Max Parker – Trusted Reviews\n\nBattery sizing differs between the two phones, however, due to the higher-res\ndisplay on the Pixel 3 XL it’ll be interesting to see how much longer it\nlasts. The Pixel 3 XL packs a 3430mAh cell with the Pixel 3 boasting 2915mAh.\nWireless Qi charging is included for the first time in a Pixel phone and\nthere’s fast charging too.\n\n[Android 9 Pie](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/android-pie) is the\nsoftware of choice here and, as this is a Google phone, you’ll be first in\nline for updates down the line. The version of Pie shipping here includes the\nnew Digital Wellbeing features, updated gesture navigation and streamlined\nnotifications.\n\n## **Pixel 3 vs Pixel 3 XL – What’s the camera like?**\n\nThe reason we’ve loved the previous Pixel phones so much is their excellent\ncameras. Even though they have never packed the biggest megapixel sensors or\nwidest apertures, they’ve managed to take exceptional snaps. A lot of this\ncomes from Google’s tremendous auto-HDR feature and the way it uses\ncomputational photography to combine multiple shots together.\n\nFor the Pixel 3 XL and Pixel 3 Google is once again focussing on software\nrather than hardware. Both phones boast a 12-megapixel sensor on the back –\nthis remains a single sensor – with an _f/_ 1.8 aperture.\n\nGoogle showed off some sample images during its presentation and they looked\nstunning. We can’t wait to start shooting with this phone and to see how it\ncompares to the Pixel 2.\n\n**Related:[Best Android Phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nandroid-phones-3438996)**\n\nGoogle’s redesigned the camera app too, making it easier to flick between\ndiffering modes.\n\nOn the front of both phones, you’ve got dual 8-megapixel sensors: one is a\nstandard sensor and the other wide-angle. Switching to this wider camera\nallows you to cram more faces into your selfies.\n\n## **Pixel 3 vs Pixel 3 XL – How much do they cost?**\n\nThe Pixel 3 starts at £739/$799 and the 3 XL costs £869/$899, with an\nadditional £100/$100 added onto each for the larger internal storage options,\nmaking these pricier Pixels at launch compared to last year’s duo.\n\n### Best Google Pixel 3 Deals\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=tr-\npixel3&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fextras%3Ftariffcode%3DFF1YMMAR18%26giftcode%3DNA%26productcode%3DO2MPIX3BLA)\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=tr-\npixel3&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fextras%3Ftariffcode%3DFF1YMMAR18%26giftcode%3DNA%26productcode%3DO2MPIX3BLA)\n\n###\n\n[Google Pixel 3 – 15GB of data on O2\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=tr-\npixel3&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fextras%3Ftariffcode%3DFF1YMMAR18%26giftcode%3DNA%26productcode%3DO2MPIX3BLA)\n\nA decent amount of data for moderate users.

For those folks, the smaller Pixel 3 offers the same camera and\nsoftware benefits in a more traditional package.\n\n"}
