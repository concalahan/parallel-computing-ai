As well as dealing\nwith pedestrians and other road users, there’ll be simulated noise from fellow\npassengers, other road users, the radio, smartphone alerts and more.\n\nInterestingly the program will integrate the [new RealSpace 3D audio\ntechnology](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/latest-oculus-rift-innovation-\nbrings-new-audio-wizardry-audio) Oculus announced at CES 2015 last week. That\nwill enable users to pinpoint the direction, distance and depth of the sound.\n\nThe program will also utilise Optimus’ 100-degree field of view which goes\nbeyond human peripheral vision, Toyota says.\n\nIf drivers lose focus, they’ll “experience the consequences of distracted\ndriving within the virtual setting,” the audio giant added in a [press\nrelease](http://pressroom.toyota.com/releases/toyota+debuts+new+diving+simulator+teen+drive+365+2015+naias.htm)\n(via [Slashgear](http://www.slashgear.com/toyota-oculus-bringing-vr-driving-\nsimulator-for-teens-14364517/)).\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nLearners will use the real steeling wheel and pedals while immersed in the 3D\nworld, with the aim of easing the nerves some young drivers may feel when\ntaking to the road for the first time.\n\n**Read more:[Samsung Gear VR review](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-\ngear-vr-review)**\n\n“Hopefully, you’ll come away a little wiser about what it takes to be safe\nbehind the wheel,” Toyota added.\n\nThose hoping to try the simulator will have to attend one the auto shows\naround the US where Toyota’s TeamDrive365 initiative has a presence.\n\n"}
