Could\none of these dream projects be Half Life 3? We can only hope, and perhaps\nwe’ll catch a glimpse of it in the near future.\n\n**Related:[Xbox One X](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/xbox-one-x-\npreorder-specs-price-release-date-2993238)**\n\nWe’re now a decade removed from Half Life 2: Episode Two, could we get a “10th\nanniversary” special announcement? Unlikely, but once again 2017 gives us\nanother excuse to be hopeful of something, anything, crawling out of Valve HQ.\n\nFor now, here’s everything we know about Half Life 3, which as you’d expect,\nisn’t much.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\n## Half-Life 3 Release Date — When is it coming out?\n\nValve manages to be brilliantly political when it comes to Half Life 3.\nNeither confirming nor denying anything, the company refuses to say pretty\nmuch anything about the game, so a release date also remains non-existent.\n\nAfter all these years we still don’t know whether the game actually exists or\nwhen it would arrive if it even does.  \n**  \nSee also:[Wolfenstein 2\npreview](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/wolfenstein-2-the-new-colossus-\npreview-release-date-preview-gameplay-trailers-2951732)**  \n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Half-Life 3 News — What’s being said about it?\n\nWe’ve had a decade of speculation about Half Life 3. From sneaky leaks to out\nand out “confirmations”, the years have been cruel to fans desperate for a\nglimpse of the real thing.  \n\n**Related:[Xbox One X vs PS4 Pro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/xbox-\none-x-vs-ps4-pro-2993235)**  \n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \n**  \n** Ironically, a Half Life 3 was actually confirmed all the way back in 2006,\nby Gabe Newell himself! Of sorts…Valve confirmed Half Life 2: Episode 3 would\nlaunch in Christmas 2007, with future episodic releases being pretty frequent\nafter that, before the series dropped off of the face of the earth entirely.\n\nThen began a series of near-misses and plenty of fakes, the latest of which\nbeing a “Half-Life 3” poster at Gamescom 2016, which in fact was a shrewd\npiece of marketing where the fine print beneath actually reads “Half-Life 3:\neditors who played it back then”. Leading to another swift kick to the groin\nfor fans. ****\n\nRelated: [Best FPS Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-fps-games)\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Half-Life 3 Story — What’s it about?\n\n_*** Half-Life 2: Episode 2 Spoiler Alert***_\n\nAt the end of Half-Life 2: Episode 2, Gordon has destroyed a dozen Striders\nthat have attacked White Forest while the rocket is being prepared. The rocket\nis successfully launched and the super portal is closed, isolating the Combine\nforces from their alien homeworld.\n\nAlyx and Gordon prepare to leave for the Borealis, but Eli (Alyx’s father)\nwarns Gordon repeatedly of the ship’s cargo. As the three of them walk into\nthe hangar, they’re attacked by a pair of Advisors and restrained by them.\n\nAs Gordon and Alyx struggle, Eli is sadly killed by one of them. As the second\ntries to kill Alyx, D0g bursts in through the roof and attacks the Advisor,\ncausing both of them to flee.\n\nThe game closes with Alyx sobbing, holding her father’s body.\n\nHalf-Life 3 would have to follow on from that. We’re not sure where the story\nwould go, but there’s always a revenge story for Alyx to take with Gordon\nalongside.  \n**  \nSee also:[GTA 6 news and\nrumours](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/gta-6-release-date-news-gameplay-\nstory-trailers-and-wishlist)**  \n![Half Life\n3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\n## Half-Life 3 Wishlist — What we’d like to see\n\n**1) Who is the G-Man?**  \nWe’ve had four different Half-Life games and we’re still none the wiser as to\nwho the mysterious G-Man is, with his black briefcase. You could even argue\nthat this enigma is more of a central character to the Half-Life series than\nGordon himself.\n\nWhy is he so interested in Gordon? Why does he keep saving Gordon’s life? What\nreason does he have to oppose the Combine?\n\nWe want all those questions answered and more. Go on, Valve, you know you want\nto.  \n**  \nRelated:[Call of Duty WW2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/call-of-\nduty-ww2)**  \n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \n**2) Don’t ditch Gorman’s fist-and-crowbar approach**  \nAlthough we like other FPS titles such as Battlefield or Call of Duty or even\nAlien: Isolation, there’s no need to make Gordon and co anything like them.\n\nHalf-Life always shone for us because of its simplicity. Here’s a man who is\nfighting an alien race with nothing more than his fist and a crowbar – and\nsome other weapons along the way, of course.\n\nThere’s room for some new weird weapons, but if anything happened to Gordon’s\nroots, we’d be severely disappointed.\n\n**3) …but make him more realistic**  \nWith the Source 2 engine, there’s a chance to make Gordon feel more like a\nreal person during gameplay. Let him press some buttons with his hands and let\nus see some feet walking around for once.  \n**  \nRelated:[PS5 latest news](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ps5-release-\ndate-price-games-news-rumours-specs-2993694)**  \n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \n**4) Show us the power of the Source 2 engine**  \nHalf-Life 2 can look fantastic on a high-powered PC thanks to the upgrades the\nSource engine has received since Half-Life 2 was released. Those physics\npuzzles paved the way in terms of videogame design, and Half-Life 3 should do\nthe same.\n\nWe hope the next Half-Life game continues the series’ tradition of breaking\nthe mould in terms of environments, interactions and puzzles, too.\n\n**5) Don’t skip any time periods**  \nIf we eventually get to play Half-Life 3 rather than Half-Life 2: Episode 3,\nwe’re hoping that Valve doesn’t do anything silly like “10 years later” or\n“100 years later” after the death of Eli.\n\nEvery other entry in the Half-Life series has followed directly on from its\npredecessor, meaning the story never skips a beat.\n\nWe want to see what happens to Alyx and Gordon directly after the rocket\nlaunch, not years later.  \n**  \nSee also:[Best PC games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-pc-games_round-\nup)**  \n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \n**6) Stay true to its roots**  \nSince Half-Life 2: Episode 2 was released back in 2007, there have been a lot\nof fantastic and successful games that have been keeping our attention. Just\nlook at [The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim](https://www.trustedreviews.com/the-\nelder-scrolls-v-skyrim-review), an entire Mass Effect trilogy, and three\nDragon Age titles, for examples.\n\nAs much as we’ve loved all of those games and many others, Half-Life is\nunique. It doesn’t need any additions to make it more akin to other titles,\nlike a levelling system, looting features, and definitely not a third-person\ncamera view.\n\nKeep Half-Life true to its roots and don’t let the last eight years of gaming\nruin its history.  \n**  \nSee also:[The Last of Us Part 2 latest\nnews](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/the-last-of-us-2-release-date-\ngameplay-trailer-pre-order-news-wishlist)**  \n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \n**7) Half-Life 3 co-op**  \nWe never thought Portal co-op would work, and then Portal 2 came along and\nblew our minds with Atlas and P-Body’s friendship.\n\nIt made us wonder whether we could tolerate co-op in Half-Life 3. Imagine\nplaying as Gordon and Alyx side by side with your buddy. We reckon we could\nhandle that.\n\n"}
