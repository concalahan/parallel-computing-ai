And no, ignoring the new kid on the HDR\nblock is not an option. Here’s your guide to HDR10+.**\n\nBack in April, Samsung and Amazon got their heads together to announce a new\nformat of high dynamic range technology. Called HDR10+, it claimed to improve\non the standard HDR10 industry standard by adding a layer of extra, scene-by-\nscene information to help TVs handle HDR playback better.\n\nGiven how complicated and messy the world of HDR already is, reactions to\nHDR10+’s announcement largely boiled down to journalists burying their heads\nin their hands and consumers burying their heads in the sand.\n\nFollowing developments at the recent IFA technology show in Berlin, though,\nHDR10+ has shifted – for better or for worse – from unwanted fringe\ncomplication to major player. Ignoring it and hoping it might go away is no\nlonger an option. So here are the key facts you need to know about HDR’s\nlatest signing, including the fact that it appears to have kicked off another\nAV format war.\n\n**Related:[Best TV](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-tv)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: Samsung\n\n## HDR10+: The IFA Effect\n\nPrior to September’s IFA show, the only announced support for HDR10+ had come\nfrom Samsung on the hardware side, and Amazon Video on the content side. And\nAmazon has yet to actually deliver any HDR10+ content.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nOn the eve of IFA, though, we learned that a new HDR10+ Alliance had been\nestablished, comprising three founder members: Samsung, Panasonic and 20th\nCentury Fox. This changed the HDR10+ format’s status overnight, as it proved\nthat other big hardware players and a major Hollywood film studio were willing\nto back the upstart format.\n\nSamsung and Panasonic account for a substantial chunk of the global TV\nmarketplace, and 20th Century Fox is one of the most prolific studios around –\nespecially when it comes to launching 4K Blu-ray discs. And the fact that\nthese three companies have gone so far as to form an alliance around the\nHDR10+ format suggests they back it against Dolby Vision, rather than\nalongside it.\n\nNote that while Amazon isn’t a member of the alliance, it has reconfirmed that\nit is committed to launching HDR10+ titles before the end of the year.\n\n## HDR10+: Why does it even exist?\n\nWhile it would easy to feel annoyed at Samsung for muddying the HDR waters\nwith another new format, there are actually six seemingly pretty solid reasons\nfor its existence.\n\n### 1) Better picture quality\n\nIt should make HDR picture quality better. The HDR10 industry standard only\nprovides a display with a single luminance guide value from each HDR title\nthat has to apply across that title’s entire running time.\n\nWith HDR10+, content creators can use an extra layer of data to add updated\nluminance information wherever they want to – potentially scene by scene, or\neven frame by frame. Having this extra data to work with should help TVs\ndeliver a more consistently impressive HDR picture. Cue HDR10+’s second raison\nd’etre…\n\n### 2) HDR quality, for less\n\nIt can deliver a more uniform HDR experience across the TV world. The idea\nbehind this is that cheaper, lower quality TVs usually don’t have enough\npicture processing power and know-how to handle HDR properly using the limited\namount of information available with HDR10.\n\nSo adding dynamic extra data should have the most positive impact on the\nlowest quality TVs, finally – hopefully – meaning you no longer have to spend\na fortune on a TV to get a decent HDR experience.\n\n### 3) It’s free!\n\nHDR10+ is free. Even though it’s chiefly been developed by Samsung, any brand\ncan use it without having to pay Samsung a royalty. This is significant\nbecause the only other ‘dynamic’ HDR format currently in play, Dolby Vision,\ndoes come with a royalty fee attached.\n\nIn fact, Samsung’s refusal to pay Dolby its royalty is one of the key reasons\nwhy it’s gone to the trouble of developing HDR10+.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: Samsung\n\n### 4) And offers more freedom…\n\nHDR10+ is apparently less prescriptive than Dolby Vision. By which I mean that\nit leaves a little more freedom for different HDR displays to bring their own\nstrengths and processes into play.\n\nBoth Samsung and Panasonic have previously argued that they trust their own\nprocessing and in-depth knowledge of their own screen capabilities to deliver\nbetter results than Dolby Vision’s ‘locked in’ approach.\n\n### 5) An open standard\n\nHDR10+ is an open standard. This means that unlike Dolby Vision, it can\nconstantly be evolved by anyone who uses it.\n\n### 6) Easier to create with\n\nHDR10+ is apparently easier to use in the mastering process. I only have\nanecdotal evidence of this from knowledgable sources so far, to be clear.\n\nBut if true, it could play a big part in the format’s potential success, as\ncontent creators generally lean towards the simpler – and thus cheaper – of\ntwo solutions where a choice is available.\n\n**Related:[What is HDR?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/hdr-tv-high-\ndynamic-television-explained-2927035)**\n\n## HDR10+: How can you get your hands (or eyes) on it?\n\nThe catch with HDR10+, of course, is that it doesn’t just magically happen.\nTVs, set-top boxes and 4K Blu-ray players have to carry the firmware to handle\nit, and content has to be made in it.\n\nAll of Samsung’s 2017 HDR TVs can support it, and the brand initially said\nthat its 2016 TVs would be updated to handle it too. Though they sounded a\ntouch less certain of this latter fact the last time I spoke to them about it.\n\nPanasonic has announced that it can add HDR10+ via firmware update to its 2017\n‘4K Pro’ TVs – essentially the EX750 LCD, and the EZ952 and EZ1002 OLED\nmodels. No other TV brand has yet announced HDR10+ support, though.\n\nNo 4K Blu-ray players have so far announced support for HDR10+, and 20th\nCentury Fox hasn’t yet put a date or name on its first HDR10+ release – be it\nstreamed or 4K Blu-ray. Indeed, the 4K Blu-ray specification does currently\ninclude support for HDR10+.\n\nIt seems unlikely there will be any issue with adding HDR10+ to the 4K BD\nspecification though – especially given that Panasonic is well represented on\nthe Blu-ray Disc Association that decides such things!\n\nI suspect we will get an explosion of HDR10+ hardware and software news at the\nCES in January.\n\n**Related:[What is\n4K?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/4k-tv-10-reasons-why-you-should-\ncare-2908860)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: Samsung\n\n## HDR10+: Is it actually any good?\n\nIt’s unlikely that Samsung would have bothered slaving over HDR10+ if it\ndidn’t think that adding dynamic metadata could introduce some substantial\nextra picture quality advantages. But seeing is always believing, of course.\n\nFortunately I got the opportunity to see three separate HDR10+ vs normal HDR10\ndemonstrations at the IFA show. The one running on Samsung’s main stand has to\nbe discounted, though, on the grounds that there was clearly too much variance\nin the core performance levels of the two displays being used. Fortunately\nPanasonic had a seemingly much more ‘authentic’ demonstration in a blacked out\nroom on its stand, and Samsung allowed me to see a much more credible behind\nthe scenes demonstration.\n\nIn both cases, the benefits of HDR10+’s extra metadata were clear to see. The\nmain benefit comes in the amount of visible detail in the brightest parts of\nthe HDR image; there’s much less ‘clipping’ of subtle shades and tones than\nyou get with vanilla HDR10.\n\nThis helps the picture look more detailed, and the impact of this detailing is\nfurther enhanced by a slight uplift during both demonstrations in the apparent\nbrightness of the image’s most intense highlights.\n\nSamsung’s head to head demonstration was done using a pair of its 2017\nflagship Q9F models, and even on these high-end sets the HDR10+ difference was\ninstantly obvious. Even though, as discussed earlier, HDR10+ is expected to\nhave the most impact on relatively affordable screens.\n\nI saw no significant impact on colour tone reproduction during the Panasonic\nhead to head, though, and on the Q9F the colour situation was it and miss.\nSome tones did look richer and punchier under the influence of HDR10+, yet\nothers actually looked a touch more washed out. This latter issue may be down,\nthough, to the Q9F’s edge lighting array struggling to control its light\nlocally enough to prevent excessive light ‘bleaching’ some tones slightly.\n\n**Related:[Dolby Vision](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/should-you-\nnext-tv-have-dolby-vision-2921025)**\n\n## HDR10+: Do we have ourselves a format war with Dolby Vision?\n\nDolby and the HDR10+ Alliance will tell you there’s no format war their two\ndynamic HDR formats, since all HDR releases on disc and the vast majority of\nHDR streams will always provide an industry standard HDR10 ‘core’. So you’ll\nalways get an HDR picture no matter what advanced HDR format your TV supports.\n\nHowever, for me we are indeed now facing at the very least a ‘soft’ format\nwar, as some films will only give their best picture quality on some TVs –\ndepending on which advanced HDR format the content and the display are using.\n\nIt’s possible some TVs will appear that try to solve this issue by supporting\nall of the available HDR formats – including Dolby Vision and HDR10+. However,\ngiven their apparently implacable opposition to Dolby Vision (they’ve gone so\nfar as to develop a free rival, after all!), it doesn’t seem like we can\nexpect Samsung or Panasonic to adopt a ‘universal playback’ policy any time\nsoon.\n\n## HDR10+: Will it even survive?\n\nHDR10+ didn’t get off to an auspicious start. Its arrival this year feels at\nleast 12 months late, and it adds more confusion and competing standards to\nthe already wildly confusing HDR realm.\n\nIt’s also got to play catch up with a Dolby Vision system that’s been around\nsince HDR first appeared, too.\n\nSome of those six advantages of HDR10+ noted earlier are pretty persuasive,\nthough, and Dolby arguably hasn’t gained as much of an advantage from its head\nstart in terms of actual released content – at least on 4K Blu-ray – as might\nhave been expected.\n\nDolby Vision support likely never showing up on the TVs of the world’s biggest\n(by far) TV brand has to be an issue, too.\n\nIn short, it’s currently impossible to predict with any certainty how the new\nHDR format war is going to pan out. Though my personal hunch is that some TVs,\nat least, will start supporting all types of HDR – and that these may be\nrewarded with persuasively handsome sales figures.\n\nKeep an eye on Trusted Reviews for further updates on this fast-moving corner\nof the AV world – especially come the CES in January.\n\n**Related:[4K Blu-ray guide](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/what-is-\nultra-hd-blu-ray-2934823)**\n\n**Let us know what you think of this article via Facebook or Twitter.**\n\n"}
