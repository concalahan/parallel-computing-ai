The feature is\ncentred around the idea there are times of the day when you’re naturally\nquiet, such as early in the morning when your partner may still be sleeping,\nor during the evening when the children are asleep.**\n\nHowever, when others are catching some z’s you may still want to ask Alexa for\nan update on your commute, or to set an alarm for the morning, without waking\nfellow members of the household. So now, if you whisper your command at Alexa,\nshe will whisper back in kind.\n\nA week on, Amazon is [explaining how the feature\nworks,](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/which-amazon-echo-speaker-should-\nyou-buy-3388590) and it’s a lot more complex than it sounds. Amazon scientist\nZeynab Raeesy says whispered speech is typically low energy and unvoiced,\nmeaning it lacks the vibration in the vocal chords. That makes it much more\ndifficult for a listening device like an Amazon Echo to pick up the sounds\neffectively.\n\n**Related:[Which Amazon Echo should you\nbuy](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/which-amazon-echo-speaker-should-you-\nbuy-3388590)**\n\nRaeesy says Amazon compared the performance of two different neural networks\nin order to to distinguish between words spoken normally and those whispered.\nThey found a long short-term memory (LSTM) network performed better than\nmultilayer perceptron (MLP) network\n\nShe wrote: “The models are trained on two categories of features. One is log\nfilter-bank energies, a fairly direct representation of the speech signal that\nrecords the signal energies in different frequency ranges. The other is a set\nof features specifically engineered to exploit the signal differences between\nwhispered and normal speech.\n\n“We found that an LSTM network that doesn’t use handcrafted features performs\nas well as an MLP that does, indicating that LSTMs are capable of learning\nwhich signal attributes are most useful for whisper detection.”\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nRaeesy added there were caveats to this approach, namely that the more data\nthe LSTM network was exposed to, the less improvement the handcrafted features\noffered. So, the model that now sits within Alexa doesn’t include the\nhandcrafted features at all.\n\nOther problems the team had to overcome included the “end-pointing” process.\nUsually, Alexa is able to detect the end of a command due to the period of\nsilence at the end. This becomes more problematic with whispering and the\nability of the LSTM network was less effective towards the end of utterances.\n\nShe said: “Unexpectedly, averaging the entire signal — including the\ntroublesome final 50 frames — yielded the best results. We suspect, however,\nthat that’s because the samples of whispered speech that we used in our\nexperiments were manually segmented, while the samples of normal speech were\nautomatically segmented, using Alexa’s production end-pointer.\n\n“There could be some consistent difference between manual and automatic\nsegmentation that the system was actually exploiting to distinguish the two\ntypes of input, and dropping the final 50 frames made that difference more\ndifficult to detect.”\n\n**Do you think whisper mode is a useful addition to Alexa’s skillset?
