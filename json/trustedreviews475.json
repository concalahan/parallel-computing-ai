We take a look\nat what the American telecoms and semiconductor giant has planned for the year\nahead.**\n\nQualcomm had a busy CES, which is probably no surprise considering the company\nhas fingers in many pies these days. In fact, a number of its announcements\nhave been in the pipeline for some time now. We first got wind of its plans\nfor the new Qualcomm Low Power Bluetooth SoC QCC5100 series at a pre-CES\nbriefing in Cambridge in late-2017, for example, while its automotive\nambitions were centre stage at the Frankfurt Motor Show last September.\n\nWith all that in mind, here are five things you can expect from Qualcomm in\n2018 and beyond.\n\n### 1) Snapdragon is going to be the brains of your vehicle…\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nArguably the biggest news out of Qualcomm’s camp at CES was the range of\npartnerships with leading car manufacturers, including Honda, Jaguar Land\nRover, and BYD. These tie-ups will see Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Automotive\nPlatform sit at the heart of a number of future vehicles, powering\ninfotainment, connectivity, and more.\n\nThe 2018 Honda Accord was on display at the show packing the tech, and you can\nexpect to see a number of other big name cars sporting it in the future.\n\nFord, for one, has also partnered with Qualcomm to uses its clever Cellular\nVehicle-to-Everything technology. Known as C-V2X, this will allow future\nvehicles to communicate with everything from other vehicles to road\ninfrastructure such as traffic lights. This will be the backbone for more\nefficient and safer autonomous vehicles.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nRead our [full report](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/qualcomm-is-\npacking-its-snapdragon-tech-into-honda-and-jaguar-land-rover-vehicles-3367900)\nfrom the ground to learn more on Qualcomm’s automotive technology.\n\n### 2) …and Qualcomm may well power your next smart speaker\n\nYou can expect to see Qualcomm technology inside future Alexa-powered smart\nspeakers, thanks to the company receiving Alexa Voice Service (AVS)\nqualification for its Qualcomm Smart Audio platform, which includes six far\nfield microphones and wake-word detection. This will include speakers that\nsupport Qualcomm’s AllPlay multi-room standard, too.\n\nQualcomm isn’t throwing all its eggs into Amazon’s basket, however.\n\nIts Smart Audio Platform will also support Microsoft’s Cortana and Google\nAssistant, giving it a hat trick of 2018’s most popular AI helpers. According\nto the company, the first Cortana-ready speakers will start popping up in the\nthe first-half of 2018, with more to follow as the year progresses.\n\n### 3) Low Power Bluetooth Audio could fix major wireless audio barriers\n\n![Qualcomm\nCES](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nBattery life of wireless headphones and hearables has been an issue for some\ntime now, because there’s nothing worse than grabbing your favourite earbuds\nto go for a run, only to find that you forgot to charge it overnight.\n\nIn 2018, Qualcomm plans to drive forward significant improvements to battery\nlife in wireless audio products, thanks to its new Low Power Bluetooth QCC5100\nSoC, which the company says will deliver reduced power consumption by up to\n65% while still supporting aptX HD and hybrid active noise cancellation. In\nfact, its aptX HD solution, which allows for higher quality wireless audio\nthrough 24-bit audio, is already available in more than 55 products, including\nfrom the likes of Bowers & Wilkins.\n\nBack in 2017 at its pre-CES audio showcase in the UK, the company told us that\nthis is a product that has “been in development for a number of years,” and\nthat the first reference designs will be shown off in the first-half of 2018 .\nThat means we could the first consumer-ready devices to feature QCC5100 SoCs\nlaunch in H2– or, we’d imagine, by 2019 at the latest.\n\nKey to these new products will be hands-free wake word activation – with\ncellular connectivity also planned for the future.\n\n> “People want to have always-on voice. You want to be able to say, ‘OK,\nGoogle’, or, ‘Hey, Alexa’, on a headset that is always listening, without\ntouching it. At some point in the future, we’ll have these headsets connected\nto the cloud, so you’ll have cellular networks in your ear,” Qualcomm told us\nat its event in Cambridge.\n\nAgain, seeing products with these features on shelves could still be a little\nways off – but 2018 certainly looks like a watershed moment in their\ndevelopment, so keep your eyes peeled.\n\n### 4) Qualcomm remains a mobile kingmaker…\n\nAs ever, you can expect to see plenty of Qualcomm tech – from Snapdragon SoCs\nto its modems and antennas – in future devices from the majority of the big\nmobile players.\n\nCristiano Amon, president of Qualcomm, said at CES: “Our advanced RF solutions\ndeliver superior connectivity performance and flexibility in form factor\ndesign, and we’re thrilled to work alongside customers like Google, HTC, LG,\nSamsung and Sony Mobile to help deliver this combination of form and function\nto consumers around the world.”\n\nThat starts early on in 2018 with the [Samsung Galaxy\nS9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s9-release-date-specs-\nfeatures-price-uk-3266552), which is widely expected to be the first\nsmartphone to feature Qualcomm’s new-gen [Snapdragon\n845](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/snapdragon-845-phones-benchmark-\nspeeds-release-date-camera-quick-charge-4-3350708) chipset. We first saw the\nnew mobile SoC revealed in late-2017 at the Snapdragon Technology Summit in\nHawaii, and after (presumably) making its way into Samsung’s next flagship,\nphones like the [LG G7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-g7-release-\ndate-specs-price-rumours-2952060) and [HTC\nU12](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/htc-u12-release-date-price-specs-\nleaks-rumours-3365974) should follow suit in sporting it under the hood.\n\nAnd of course, come late-2018, we’ll also be looking at the next iteration of\nQualcomm’s Snapdragon SoC, which is likely to be dubbed the Snapdragon 855\nbased on the firm’s current naming conventions.\n\n### 5) …and now it wants a bigger slice of the VR throne\n\n![snapdragon\nvr820](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAt CES 2018, Hugo Barra from Oculus announced that the standalone Oculus Go\nheadset will use the Snapdragon 821 chipset, which is part of the Qualcomm\nMobile VR platform. This is one of the biggest coups to date for Qualcomm in\nthe VR world, and follows neatly on from recent\n[reports](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/qualcomm-snapdragon-845-mixed-\nreality-3354054) that a modified, VR-specific version of the Snapdragon 845\ncould break cover this year.\n\nKeep your eyes peeled on MWC 2018 in particular, as the rumour mill suggests\nSamsung could reveal a new mixed reality Gear headset at the event, alongside\nthe Galaxy S9. If this happens, there’s every chance such a device would also\nfeature Snapdragon internals.\n\n_Additional reporting by James Laird and Sean Keach_\n\n**What do you think Qualcomm has lined up for 2018?
