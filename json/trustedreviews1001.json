It’s one of the\nmost entertaining multiplayer experiences you could hope for, it takes the\nidea of arcade-style tennis, embraces the madness, while also ensuring it’s\naccessible to a wider audience. Nintendo has done itself proud.\n\nThis may not be surprising, though. The company has proven time and time again\nthat when it does get it right it _really_ gets it right and Aces captures\nthat same magic. Somehow blending the idea of over the top shots with a sense\nof skill and depth, you’ll contest epic rallies against an opponent before\nyour racket explodes after you fail to deal with a special maneuver. Even if\nyou don’t like the idea of exaggerated moves you can turn them off, but\nlearning how they operate and then using them to your advantage is a huge\nreason Mario Tennis is so good. For example, who doesn’t want to slow down\ntime before specifically picking off a rival? It’s beyond frustrating when\nyou’re the one who suffers, but it’s the same reason Mario Kart works so well.\nThe sheer elevation mixed with utter despair is what keeps you coming back for\nmore.\n\nWhat may divide individuals a little is the single-player campaign as it\ndoesn’t follow the path many had hoped for. For years fans have been\nscrambling for a return of the RPG mechanics which proved to be so compelling\nin past entries, but they’re not present here at all. There is a basic\nlevelling-up system designed to highlight that you are progressing, but\nultimately the campaign is a collection of mini-challenges that help you get\nbetter at the game. That’s it.\n\n**Related:[Best Nintendo Switch\nGames](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/nintendo-switch-games-3435122)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nWhile the former would have been preferred what’s here is far from bad. In\nfact, it’s perfectly fine. Bizarre boss battles against Petey the Piranha are\nmixed in with tutorials and missions, and all of it comes together thanks to\nan overworld map. As you explore it you’ll be introduced to new courts and\ncertain hazards that continue to ignore how real tennis operates, and it’s all\nso easy to play. The truth is all of this just fails to live up to the thrill\nof playing against another human being.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nTo its credit, Nintendo has decided to rip off The Avengers to add some more\nflavour. Mario’s racket is, essentially, the equivalent of Thanos’ Infinity\nGauntlet, but it’s done so ingeniously it’ll at least raise a smile. If you\nneed more, Luigi has also been kidnapped by said racket. I think. It’s so nuts\nit’s hard to believe anything you hear is real. This adds a loose narrative to\nproceedings, although you’ll hardly be looking for one in a game based on\nMario and Tennis. Either way, it’s ludicriously entertaining.\n\nThis isn’t what’s going to take up most your time, though. Almost feeling like\na fighting game such is its back and forth nature, Mario Tennis Aces exists to\nbreathe life back into the genre and does so wonderfully. Not since the\nhallowed days of Virtua Tennis has a title about smashing balls brought so\nmuch joy, and when it all starts to click you’ll understand how layered it is.\n\n**Related:[Upcoming Nintendo Switch\nGames](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/upcoming-nintendo-switch-\ngames-2018)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nYou can mash away on the buttons and still get something out of it, but\nlearning the core mechanics is incredibly rewarding. If it finds the right\ncommunity, I can easily see this sitting alongside the likes of Mario Kart and\nSuper Smash Bros. – a game that just needs the odd tweak here and there given\nhow solid the foundations are to remain consistently relevant. When it’s good,\nit’s great.\n\nAs ever if Nintendo’s unique take on sports isn’t for you this will do nothing\nto change that, but anyone else should think of this as a serious addition to\ntheir Switch’s library. Games are meant to be fun and that seems to be the\nmajor goal here. It’s a success and yet another situation where the veteran\ndesigners continue to prove their worth.\n\n## Verdict\n\nMario Tennis Aces is awesome and a must-have if multiplayer experiences are\nyour thing. It blends silliness with seriousness really quite brilliantly, and\nis a testament to Nintendo’s efforts within this space. No one else would ever\neven comes close.\n\n## Score\n\n  \n\n"}
