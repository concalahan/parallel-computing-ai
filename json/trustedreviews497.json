However, no one was expecting a new, fully-formed title in the\nUndertale series to just appear out of nowhere.\n\n**Related:[Best RPG Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nrpg-3523043)**\n\n![Deltarune](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nNo green? Animals\n\nWe’ll steer clear of spoilers, but there’s clearly both a deep knowledge of\nJRPGs and a charming irreverence to both the genre and idea of player choice\nthat makes the game more interesting than several of the titles that it apes.\nWant to take a moment during a brutal battle to compliment the attacking\nteenager on his sweet bike? You can do that here.\n\nA lot of these standards were, I’m told, setup in Undertale. However,\nconfession time, I’ve never played it and this game has gone a long way to\npique my interest in that title, for the low low price of nothing. So, whether\nyou’ve heard about Undertale but haven’t played it, enjoy a good indie RPG or\nperhaps even just love the original Undertale and want more of the same, it\nseems there’s plenty of reasons to recommend this.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### This surprise free Undertale spinoff is a spooky Halloween miracle\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/gaming/surprise-free-undertale-spinoff-\nspooky-halloween-miracle-3613524 \"This surprise free Undertale spinoff is a\nspooky Halloween miracle\")\n\n  * [ ![Google Home Hub volume controls](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Google Home Hub security labelled ‘beyond dismal’ – Google rubbishes\nclaims\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-home-hub-security-risk-3613533\n\"Google Home Hub security labelled ‘beyond dismal’ – Google rubbishes claims\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Samsung Galaxy Note 9 back](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Samsung hints that a 5G phone and foldable device are right around the\ncorner\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-hints-5g-phone-foldable-handset-\nright-around-corner-3613530 \"Samsung hints that a 5G phone and foldable device\nare right around the corner\")\n\n  * \n\n**Related:[Best Gaming Headset](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\ngaming-headsets-3431813)**\n\n![Deltarune](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nMy favourite food is pain\n\nThe game can be downloaded for free at\n[Deltarune.com](https://www.deltarune.com/). However, I encountered an issue\nwith Deltarune’s uninstaller that meant for some reason everything in the same\nfolder as it was uninstalled. This meant I savaged my Itch.io collection,\nwhich was unfortunate. You can mitigate this risk until it is inevitably\npatched up by installed Deltarune into a separate folder all of its own.\n\n**What will you playing this Halloween?
