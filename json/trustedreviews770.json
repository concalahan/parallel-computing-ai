Here’s what we know so far about the Surface Studio. __\n\n**Related: __[Windows 10 Creators Update – 6 killer\nfeatures](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/windows-10-creators-update-\nfeatures-how-to-download)** _  \n_\n\n## What is the Surface Studio?\n\nThe Surface Studio is Microsoft’s latest addition to generally well received\nSurface line-up.\n\nJoining the likes of the [Surface\nBook](https://www.trustedreviews.com/microsoft-surface-book-review), [Surface\nPro 4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/microsoft-surface-pro-4-review), and\n[Surface 3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/surface-3-review), the Surface\nStudio is an AIO Windows 10 PC with a difference – as well as propping up like\na traditional desktop, it folds almost completely flat.\n\nMicrosoft claims the addition represents a “new category of device” and a\n“profound experience” that will “help you bring your ideas to life”.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nWhat does that actually mean? Here’s what we know so far.\n\nThe Surface Studio is a 28-inch AIO PC that Microsoft claims represents the\n“thinnest LCD monitor ever built” and features a Gorilla Glass-protected\ndisplay powered by Microsoft’s PixelSense technology.\n\nThere are a few configurations on offer, with the base model coming with an\nIntel Core i5 Processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 1TB hybrid drive.\n\nThe priciest model packs a quad-core Intel Core i7 processor, 32GB of DDR4\nRAM, an Nvidia GTX980M GPU, and a 2TB hybrid drive.\n\nConnectivity comes in the form of four USB ports, a mini DisplayPort and an\nEthernet jack, plus there’s an HD webcam and built-in mic array that’s\napparently optimised for speaking to Cortana. There’s also a new accessory in\nthe form of the Surface Dial.\n\n**Related:[Microsoft Surface Studio launch event – what you need to\nknow](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/microsoft-event-windows-10-surface-\nhardware-redstone-2-news-preview)**\n\n## When is the Surface Studio coming out?\n\nGood question. The Surface Studio is available to pre-order immediately, at\nleast in the US, with demos on offer at Microsoft stores from Thursday October\n27.\n\nMicrosoft added that the device will only be available in “limited quantities”\nthis holiday season, and encouraged you to order “quickly” if you want to slot\none under the Christmas tree.\n\nI’m tempted to view this rallying cry as little more than a crude marketing\nploy, but given how oversubscribed recent releases like the iPhone 7 Plus and\nGoogle Pixel have been, I’m inclined to temper my natural cynicism.\n\n## How much does the Surface Studio cost?\n\nUS pricing for the Surface Studio starts at $2,999, with some configurations\ncosting as much as $4,199. While UK specific pricing has yet to be confirmed,\nthe cheapest machine equates to roughly £2,450. Adjusting for tax and the\ncurrent state of the pound, we’d expect the UK RRP to be at least £2,799 when\nit launches here.\n\n## Should I care about the Surface Studio?\n\nIn a word, yes. Microsoft’s Surface products are some of the very best on the\nmarket and showcase the company’s Windows 10 operating system at its very\nbest.\n\nWhile the bulk of Microsoft’s October event fell flat with the\n_TrustedReviews_ staff, the Surface Studio genuinely elicited ‘ooohs’ and\n‘aaahs’ from across the war room, with one of our number going so far as to\nsay, “I might be switching to PC.” (By way of balance, other in-house comments\nincluded, “that’s amazingly expensive.”)\n\nThat pretty much says it all, but stay tuned for more details and our first\nimpressions of the Surface Studio.\n\n**Watch Now: Microsoft Event in under 2 minutes**\n\n**  \nAre you excited about the Surface Studio?
