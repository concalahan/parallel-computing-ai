You’ll love it, but don’t put a ring on it. Your HomePod’s\nnew home features durable & luxurious American full-grain leather with an\nultra-soft leather backing because the only rings you should see in your home\nthis season are of the Olympic variety on TV.”\n\nEssentially this is just a leather coaster you’d find in most home improvement\nstores, but well played, Pad & Quill. Well played.\n\n![Pen\nQuill](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nApple is currently advising HomePod users that the stains are likely to fade\nafter a couple of days. However the company says HomePod fans should simply\nrefinish their furniture(!) if not.\n\nSince the anomaly, further reports have [claimed the Sonos One\nspeaker](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/sonos-one-white-stains-wood-\nhomepod-3396911) is also leaving furniture with unsightly white marks. Sonos\nhas acknowledged our request for a comment but hasn’t yet offered up a\nstatement.\n\n**Has the ‘white ring’ issue put you off buying a HomePod?
