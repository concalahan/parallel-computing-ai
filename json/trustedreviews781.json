We’re still busy emptying the sick\nbucket after that opening montage.\n\nThe App Store turns 10 this year, we’re reliably informed – mad to think the\niPhone was launched without it way back when, eh?\n\nThe Mac App Store is rumoured to be getting a significant design refresh this\nyear, so hopefully there’s a point to all this gushing.\n\n“Today is all about software,” Cook says, revealing that we’ll be getting\nupdates to all of Apple’s platforms – iOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS.\n\nWe’ll start with iOS 12 (which you can now consider confirmed) and Craig\nFederighi.\n\nCraig’s getting his smug on and comparing iOS and Android adoption rates.\n\n**Related:[iPhone SE 2 (2018)](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-\nse-2-release-date-price-specs-2018-3339886)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSome real news now: iOS 12 will be available for all of the same devices as\niOS 11 was, so those of you with older Apple phones and tablets needn’t worry\nabout being left behind. It’ll also be a free upgrade, in case there was any\ndoubt.\n\nWe’re now moving on to augmented reality, so presumably this is the\n[ARKit](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/what-is-apple-arkit-3286676)\nupdate we’ve heard mooted in the build-up to WWDC.\n\nApple has just unveiled a new file format for AR: USDZ. It\n\nApple worked with Pixar to make a new file format for AR: USDZ. It was\ndeveloped in partnership with Pixar, and Adobe Creative Cloud will support it\nnatively.\n\nFed is back on stage and talking up a new AR measurement tool. It’s\nimaginatively dubbed Measure. Any guess what it does?\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nNow we’re on to ARKit proper and the update is, unsurprisingly, ARKit 2.0\n\nThe biggest updated is apparently around “shared experiences” and “multi-user\naugmented reality”.\n\nLEGO director of innovation, Martin Sanders, takes the stage to showcase the\npossibilities of [ARKit](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/what-is-apple-\narkit-3286676). The crux of it seems to be that AR games on Apple devices are\nget real, with LEGO AR experiences promised to launch on the App Store “later\nthis year”.\n\nSeriously, if Pokémon Go is anything to go by, your local High Street is going\nto be swamped with kids pointing iPads at the off-license next summer. Beats\nbegging for a bottle of White Lightning and a packet of Rizla kings, I guess…\n\nPhotos is up next. More search suggestions and features\n\nSiri has stepped up to the plate and will also be getting smarter, courtesy of\na new feature and supporting app called Shortcuts.\n\nThird-party apps will be able to integrate “quick actions to Siri,” Fed tells\nus, so if you say “Siri I lost my keys,” Tile will be activated – to give you\nthe example used on stage.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSiri Suggestions will also now be served up on your lock screen, based around\nrepetitive tasks like ordering coffee, and iOS 12 users will be able to create\ntheir own [Siri Shortcuts](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/siri-shortcuts-\nupdate-3481072) to help (mostly) automate common tasks like the ones mentioned\nabove.\n\nThis kind of functionality was already available to iOS users, via a neat app\ncalled Workflow, but this will no doubt be a lot more tightly integrated and\neasy to use.\n\nNow it’s time for some native app updates, or as I sometimes like to call it,\n“the toilet break window.”\n\nMinor tweaks to Apple News, Stocks, Voice Memos, CarPlay, Books…wait, Stocks?\nIs that still a thing? Does it really exist outside of everyone’s ‘Random\nCrap’ folder?\n\nApparently so, because not only is Stocks coming to the iPad, but it’ll now\nintegrate Apple News stories, so your FTSE updates will now more closely\nresemble your topless celeb alerts. How convenient.\n\nBuried in all the waffle, though, is the actually consequential news that\nGoogle Maps will be coming to CarPlay. This is kind of a big deal, if only\nbecause it means Apple has finally admitted that its attempt at Maps sucks.\n\nA-ha! The ‘Digital Health’ initiative we’ve heard so much about is taking\ncentre stage at last….\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIn Apple-speak, this means a “comprehensive set of built-in features to help\nyou limit distraction,” including grouped notifications (thank god) and a new\n“Do Not Disturb During Bedtime” button that will silence all of the little\nvoices in your head…or on your phone, at least.\n\nThere’ll also be new usage reports in iOS 12, and parents will be able to set\nlimitations for their kids right in Apple’s mobile OS – no more fiddly third-\nparty apps. A handful of startups literally just went bust.\n\nAnd, just as it’s looking to ween you off your smartphone addiction…Apple\nreleases something guaranteed to have you glued to your smartphone at all\ntimes.\n\nIt’s called ‘Memoji’ and is an extension of\n[Animoji](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-x-animoji-3335178) –\nyou’ll be able to make Animoji of yourself, in short.\n\nGroup FaceTime looks cool and could be a real boon for small businesses,\nfreelancers, creative professionals, and all the other weirdos (such as tech\njournalists) who use Apple products like their life depended on it.\n\nNow it’s on to watchOS 5. “Growth has been off the charts,” we’re told.\n\nThe first major new watchOS feature is the ability to challenge your friends\nto 7-day competitions. The social element of the Apple Watch is constantly\nimproving, it seems – and that’s bad news for all other fitness tracker\nmakers. It’s the only advantage they ever had, really.\n\nWalkie-Talkie is also finally going to see light of day. Some of you might\nremember that this feature was first demoed during the original Apple Watch\nunveiling and lets you ping little voice messages to your fellow Apple Watch-\ntoting buddies.\n\nSiri Shortcuts are coming to watchOS 5, too, which could also be pretty damn\nuseful.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nMore intriguingly, Siri will now no longer require a ‘wake word’. Whereas now,\nyou have to raise your wrist and say, ‘Hey Siri’ to summon the AI helper, now\nSiri will activate itself whenever you raise your wrist.\n\nPresumably there’ll be an easy way to disable this, because plenty of people\nwon’t want Siri listening in every time they move their hand in an upwards\ndirection…\n\nFinishing off all things watch OS is a snazzy new Pride-themed Apple Watch\nband.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nwatchOS 5 will also support podcasts, and the Siri watch face will now be able\nto display third-party apps as well as Apple ones.\n\nIt’s tvOS o’clock now, and here’s something worth skipping dinner for – [Dolby\nAtmos](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/what-is-dolby-atmos-2942509)\nsupport is coming to the Apple TV!\n\nThis is big. It means the [Apple TV\n4K](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/apple-tv-4k) will be only streaming\nbox to support both Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision. That’s a pretty compelling\npackage for AV buffs…\n\nAnother new tvOS (we’re on tVOS 12, if you’re interested…) feature will be\n‘zero sign-on’. This will mean if your Apple TV detects that you’re on TV\nprovider’s broadband network, you won’t have to login to your Apple account –\nit’ll auto-detect for you. Sounds like it might be a US-focussed, at least to\nbegin with.\n\nGuess who’s back? Back again? Fed is back. Tell a friend.\n\nmacOS time, with approximately 20 minutes to go. And it is, as we speculated\nearlier (following a leak), mac OS 12.14 Mojave.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAlso as leaked, the main new feature is the introduction of a system-wide Dark\nMod. It looks as beautiful as the desert at night, Apple says, and you’ll want\nto use it whether you need to or not. MacBook-toting goths everywhere whoop in\nunison.\n\nThere’s a whole host of new functionality, mostly centred around productivity\nand creativity. I’m personally excited about the squeaky clean new Screenshot\ninterface, which is going to make a lot of people’s lives A LOT easier.\n\nContinuity Camera also looks neat. When set-up, it’ll mean the photos you take\nare ported directly to your Mac – another major time-saver.\n\nRounding things out are macOS apps, and as expected, Apple News is coming the\nMac.\n\nPrivacy is also on the agenda, and Apple says it’s making it more difficult\nfor data companies to track you.\n\nLooks like the Mac App Store is going to be tonight’s encore and…yes, there it\nis. The redesigned Mac App Store is here, following on from last year’s iOS\nApp Store overhaul.\n\nHere’s a sneak peek.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nBut wait, there’s more. Apple is talking about some the technologies\nunderlying its software products, starting with Metal, which is Apple’s native\ngraphics….thing.\n\nThat’s pretty much the ‘General Interest’ portion of tonight’s keynote done\nwith, it seems. No [iPhone SE 2,](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-\nse-2-release-date-2018-3339886) as some had predicted, but plenty worth\ntalking about on the software front!\n\n## WWDC 2018 Live Stream: How to re-watch the Apple WWDC keynote\n\nMiss the Apple WWDC 2018 live stream?
