For this reason,\nlaptops with Intel’s new refreshed 8th CPUs will come with stickers saying\n‘Optimized For Connectivity’, so at a glance you’ll be able to tell the\ndifference between a new 8th Gen laptop and an 8th Gen laptop from last year.\n\nOther benefits include improved video rendering times and battery life, with a\ndevice powered by the top tier Whiskey Lake CPU giving Intel an impressive 16\nhours of video playback.\n\nIn other words, you’ll be able to power through more video edits and upload\nhands-ons to YouTube that much quicker, all with having more juice left in the\ntank.\n\nBut what about the CPUs themselves? What names and numbers should you be\nlooking out for when picking your next laptop?\n\nWe’ve got full specs for all of them below. After that, we’ll explore some of\nIntel’s claims about the benefits of this 8th Gen refresh in more detail.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n**Related:[Intel 9th Gen](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/intel-9th-gen-\ncpu-release-date-specs-3501382)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n(Credit: Intel Corporation)\n\n## **What is Whiskey Lake?**\n\nWhiskey Lake refers to the architecture for Intel CPUs from the refreshed 8th-\ngeneration range. They follow the 14 nanometre process.\n\nA step up from Amber Lake, Intel has said that CPUs based on Whiskey Lake\narchitecture will have the U-series designation, which are a little more\ncapable and more power-demanding than processors from the Y-series. These will\nlikely appear in laptops aimed at creatives and gamers. As such, there’s no\nprice info for these as such – you won’t be able to pick these off of the\nshelf for a custom PC build and given that they’re geared towards portable\ndevices, nor would you want to.\n\n**Related:**[ **Best Intel processor: Core i3, i5, i7 and i9\nexplained**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-intel-processor-3517396)\n\n## Whiskey Lake – Specifications\n\n**CPU name** | **Base Clock Speed** | **Boost Clock Speed** | **TDP** |\n**Cores/Threads** | **Cache size** | **RAM types supported**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \ni7-8565U | 1.8GHz | 4.6GHz | 15W | 4/8 | 8MB | LPDDR3 2133MHz, DDR4 2400MHz  \ni5-8265U | 1.6GHz | 3.9GHz | 15W | 4/8 | 6MB | LPDDR3 2133MHz, DDR4 2400MHz  \ni3-8145U | 2.1GHz | 3.9GHz | 15W | 2/4 | 4MB | LPDDR3 2133MHz, DDR4 2400MHz  \n  \n## Whiskey Lake – Price\n\nThe new [Acer Swift 5 (2018)](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/acer-\nswift-5-2018-3548218), one of the very first laptops to get the Whiskey Lake\nCPU built in, comes in two versions: one with a Core i5-8265U and another with\na Core i7-8565U. The former will have a starting price of €999, while the\nlatter will cost at least €1,099/$1099. UK prices are yet to be confirmed.\n\nGiven the capabilities and touted features of Whiskey Lake, like gigabit Wi-Fi\nand fast video rendering, we’re not surprised that the price is floating\naround the thousands.\n\nHowever, the [Acer Swift 3\n(2018)](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/acer-swift-3-2018) also has the\nWhiskey Lake CPU integrated, but at a slightly more affordable starting price\nof €799, suggesting you won’t necessarily have to give your bank balance a\nbashing to get your hands on a laptop with Intel’s latest laptop CPU.\n\nWhether we’ll see any future laptops housing the Whiskey Lake CPU for a\ncheaper price remains to be seen, but we’ll update this section as soon as we\nget more information.\n\n**Related:[Acer Swift 5 (2018) first\nlook](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/acer-swift-5-2018-3548218)**\n\n## Whiskey Lake – Release date\n\nThe [Acer Swift 5](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/acer-\nswift-5-2018-3548218) will be one of the first laptops to house the Whiskey\nLake CPU, releasing as soon as this September.\n\nWe’ll likely have to wait a little longer to see other laptop manufacturers\nfollow suit with the Whiskey Lake CPU, but we expect more to launch later this\nyear, potentially including the [Asus ZenBook 2018\nlineup](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/asus-zenbook-2018-3544000).\n\n## **What is Amber Lake?**\n\nAmber Lake is Intel’s code for low-powered CPUs from its refreshed 8th-\ngeneration range. They follow the 14 nanometre process.\n\nWhat devices are Amber Lake CPUs designed for? Amber Lake architecture is used\nfor low power, low performance Y-series CPUs, but you shouldn’t necessarily\nread ‘cheap notebooks’ here.\n\nRan Senderovitz, Vice President and General Manager for Intel’s Israel\nDevelopment Centres, said that Amber Lake CPUs are “optimised for laptops with\nvery thin, fanless designs… these are very thin, as much as 7mm thin, and very\nquiet.”\n\nExpect Amber Lake-type CPUs to appear in devices aimed mainly at people who\nneed a lightweight, basic laptop for word processing, spreadsheets, email,\nNetflix. Undemanding, everyday tasks, basically.\n\n**Related:[Best laptops](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nlaptops-3431966)**\n\n## Amber Lake – Specifications\n\n**CPU name** | **Base Clock Speed** | **Boost Clock Speed** | **TDP** |\n**Cores/Threads** | **Cache size** | **RAM types supported**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \ni7-8500Y | 1.5GHz | 4.2GHz | 5W | 2/4 | 4MB | LPDDR3 2133MHz  \ni5-8265U | 1.3GHz | 3.9GHz | 5W | 2/4 | 4MB | LPDDR3 2133MHz  \ni3-8145U | 1.1GHz | 3.4GHz | 5W | 2/4 | 4MB | LPDDR3 2133MHz  \n  \n## Amber Lake – Price\n\nGiven their low-power focus, it’s expected that laptops and 2-in-1s running on\nAmber Lake-based CPUs, as their Y-series suffix suggests, will be priced\ntowards the lower end of the market, but we don’t have an idea of prices just\nyet.\n\nAs with Whiskey Lake CPUs, Amber Lake is designed for laptops – you won’t be\nable to buy any off the shelf and start building a gaming PC.\n\n## Amber Lake – Release date\n\nBesides the nebulous ‘fall‘ (or ‘autumn‘ to people on the other side of the\npond), Intel hasn’t said when the first devices running on Amber Lake-based\nCPUs will hit the markets.\n\n**Related:[Best Laptop for Students](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nlaptop-for-students-3444216)**\n\n## **Whiskey Lake and Amber Lake – What’s new with Intel’s refreshed 8th\nGen?**\n\n**Faster video rendering**\n\nIntel’s presentation said that you’ll be able to create 4K videos ‘up to 6.5x\nfaster’, but that’s based on a test of a device powered by one of the new\nWhiskey Lake CPUs (i5-8265U) running an unspecified version of PowerDirector\nvs the Core i5-4200U, a processor we saw in mid-range ultrabooks and\neducation-centric laptops from 2014, running the same software.\n\nA fair basis of comparison? On the surface, maybe not, but Intel’s General\nManager for Mobile PC Segments Josh Newman says that the company is “targeting\npeople on five year old or older PCs who may not know that they’re being held\nback.” So in that context, picking an older CPU is a shrewd basis of\ncomparison.\n\nAs for how this compares to more recent laptops, note that we’re changing up\nhow we test performance laptops geared towards creatives and video editing\nwill form a key part of this, so watch this space.\n\n**Gigabit Wi-Fi**\n\nThe smallprint on a slide on Intel’s presentation claims that 802.11ac 2×2\nwill give you and expected maximum throughput of 1213Mbps and a theoretical\nmaximum of 1733Mbps. Additionally, in order to get gigabit Wi-Fi working,\nyou’ll need to be connected to a router that supports 160MHz channels.\n\nTo demonstrate this, at a press event, Yuriy Kozachuk, analyst for Intel’s\nperceptual computing team demonstrated gigabit Wi-Fi in action, and moved a\n10GB file from a NAS drive (a Synology DS718+) to an unspecified Whiskey Lake\ndevice via a Netgear Nighthawk X10 R9000, and the file transfer completed in\naround 1 minute 12 seconds.\n\nAs with all kinds of wireless connectivity, environmental factors and the\nmaterials a device is made of can play as much a part as network ones. The\ndevice we saw also wasn’t running anything else at the time, so while it’s\nmaybe not wholly representative of a real-world environment (where you’d have\n30 tabs open in Chrome and Spotify blaring in the background), it was\nimpressive.\n\nWe’re looking forwards to seeing if we can replicate this when we get some NAS\ndrives and advanced routers in for testing, not to mention Whiskey and Amber\nLake laptops.\n\n**Battery Life**\n\nIntel’s claiming that laptops powered by its flagship Whiskey Lake CPU will\nsee you able to get around 16 hours of playback, which is an impressive claim.\n\nOn paper that’s enough for you to play all of the extended cut versions of the\nLord of the Rings films, if you were so minded.\n\nBut how did Intel arrive at this 16 hour figure? Similar to how we recently\ntested the longevity of the [13-inch MacBook Pro\n2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/macbook-pro-13-inch) – by setting\nthe screen brightness to 150 nits and looping a two minute 30fps 4K clip ’til\nthe battery carked it – Intel set the screen of an unnamed device powered by\nthe i7-8565U to 200 nits, let the OS idle for 10 minutes before looping a\nlocally stored 24fps 1080p video file until battery death occurred.\n\nFigures for the rest of the range weren’t forthcoming at the time of writing,\nbut we’ll update this, and as and when we start picking up review samples with\nWhiskey Lake and Amber Lake CPUs, we’ll put them through their paces, too.\n\n**What do you think about Intel’s new laptop CPUs? Will you be upgrading your\nfive-year old laptop now or will you wait for some Whiskey? Let us know\n@TrustedReviews.**\n\n"}
