Here’s why.**\n\nWhen you think of Google and smartphones, you think of Android, right? But\nGoogle has its fingers in a number of smartphone technology pies, and one of\nthe most exciting of those is Project Tango. It could transform the way you\nsee the world – or at least, the way your smartphone sees it.\n\nNow Lenovo has launched the Phab 2 Pro, the first Project Tango-equipped\nsmartphone, and Asus has introduced its own Tango-equipped handset in the form\nof the ZenFone 3, the technology is available for consumers to try out.\n\nSo what exactly is Project Tango all about? Let’s take a look at how Google’s\naugmented reality ambitions could revolutionise smartphones.\n\n**Related:[ CES 2017](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ces-las-\nvegas-2017-news-highlights-rumours-dates-schedule-preview)**\n\n**VIDEO: Watch our video of Google Project Tango in action**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n## PROJECT TANGO – MAKING SMARTPHONES SEE\n\nAnnounced early in 2014 and developed by Google’s Advanced Technology and\nProjects (ATAP) team, Project Tango is Google’s attempt to get mobile phones\nand tablets to see the way we see.\n\nThis means granting the device full spatial awareness, or the ability to\nunderstand your environment and your relation to it.\n\nThe essential aim is to get your smartphone to understand the world around it,\nenabling it to provide augmented reality experiences.\n\nMore recently, the likes of Intel and Qualcomm have announced reference\nProject Tango devices for developers to work on, which has prompted a great\ndeal of excitement among the development community.\n\n## HOW DOES PROJECT TANGO WORK?\n\nA Project Tango device ‘sees’ the environment around it through a combination\nof three core functions.\n\nFirst up is motion tracking, which allows the device to understand its\nposition and orientation using a range of sensors (including accelerometer and\ngyroscope).  \n **  \nRelated:[10 things Google should have announced at I/O 2016 – but didn’t  \n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-io-2016-keynote-what-wasnt-\nannounced)  \n![ProjectTango](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)**\n\nThen there’s depth perception, which examines the shape of the world around\nyou. Intel provides a vital cog in this respect with its\n[RealSense](https://www.trustedreviews.com/intel-realsense-camera-review) 3D\ncamera. With this component on board, a device can gain accurate gesture\ncontrol and snappy 3D object rendering among other things.\n\nFinally, Project Tango incorporates area learning, which means that it maps\nout and remembers the area around it.\n\n## WHAT CAN PROJECT TANGO DO?\n\nWell there’s a bunch of obvious, but useful, stuff that Tango is capable of.\nAnd then there’s the range of potential applications that people and\nbusinesses are just starting to think of.\n\nFor example you can use a Project Tango device to instantly measure a room and\nrecord an area’s dimensions. This would mean that you don’t have to stand\naround Ikea with a paper measuring tape scratching your head with an\nundersized pencil while you try and figure out if that sofa bed will fit in\nyour spare room. You’ll instantly have the information there on your phone.\n\n**Related:[Google I/O 2016](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/google-\nio-2016-news-what-to-expect)**\n\n![LenovoProjectTango2](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nA phone or tablet packing Project Tango and a RealSense camera makes such\neveryday tasks a lot simpler.\n\nThere’s also potential for helping those whose eyesight may be fading. Tango\nrecognises where a device is in relation to the environment so it can send\nsignals by sound, or even voice, to the user. Researchers at the University of\nLincoln are working on just that.\n\nTo give an idea of the potential accuracy and sophistication we’re talking\nabout here, Intel has plugged its RealSense camera (which is utilised in\nProject Tango devices) into drones so they can automatically avoid obstacles –\neven moving ones – without the need of Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connectivity.\n\n## AR GAMING WITH PROJECT TANGO\n\nOne of the more fun applications comes in the way of gaming. More\nspecifically, how Project Tango can use augmented reality apps to let you play\ngames in real-world environments.\n\nLate last year we tried out a basic robot first-person blaster using a\nprototype Project Tango device. Moving around a phone mounted on a Nerf gun\ngave us a 360-degree view of our surroundings.\n\nThis wasn’t so different from using any accelerometer-packing smartphone with\na VR app, but such apps don’t respond to your physical movements the way they\ndo with Project Tango. Step forward with the aforementioned app, and objects\non screen start to get nearer accordingly.\n\n**Related:[What is\nHololens?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/hololens-release-date-news-\nand-price)  \n**  \n![Intel\ntango](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nImagine sneaking your way up to a shiny little critter with perfect accuracy\nin Pokemon Go before throwing your Poke ball. This element alone can bring a\nwhole new set of mechanics to mobile games.\n\nThen there are the game environments themselves. Maps can be created using the\nlayout of your house or garden, making level-design far more personal and\nfamiliar.\n\nIn many ways the effect of the position tracking technology is similar to\nusing the [HTC Vive](https://www.trustedreviews.com/htc-vive-review) VR\nheadset except Tango doesn’t require chunky lasers to understand the space\naround you, and it’s not restrained to a specific 20’x20′ area.\n\nIn many ways, then, it’s closer to Microsoft’s\n[HoloLens](https://www.trustedreviews.com/microsoft-hololens-review) in its\nfocus on enhancing reality rather than creating a whole new virtual one.\n\n## PROJECT TANGO MEANS BUSINESS\n\nIt’s not all fun and games. Project Tango could have some genuinely useful\nbusiness applications to it.\n\nWhether it’s to map a house for an estate agent to put online or helping\nrobots better interact with an environment, there are countless applications\nthat can help companies do things quicker and smarter.\n\nCollaborations with retailers like Walgreens and Target have already started\nin the US. Aimed at helping you part with your cash more efficiently, they’re\nstill in their infancy but give a glimpse into the shop of the future.\n\nWe’ve seen Project Tango likened to Google’s outdoors mapping technique for\nits Google Maps project, but scaled down and focused on indoors environments.\n\n**Related:[Best VR headset](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/best-vr-\nheadset)**\n\n![Tango](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThat should tell you another of Google’s grand plans here – to patch together\nthe data from all Project Tango devices and map public indoor spaces, such as\nairports and shopping malls.\n\nAmong other things, it could open up a whole new level of location-based\nadvertising when you walk past certain shops, or even certain aisles in the\nsupermarket.\n\n## GOOGLE’S GRAND PLANS\n\nOf course, Google has a lot of pet projects on the go, relatively few of which\nactually turn in to full-blown projects. That’s just the way it works.\n\nHowever, Google seems to mean business with Project Tango. According to a\nrecent [Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-12/google-\nlooks-beyond-maps-to-chart-the-interior-world-in-3-d) report, the company\nplans to make its technology ubiquitous. For the time being, it’s only\navailable on two smartphones, but that’s set to change in the coming years.\n\nIt’s also said to be working on a way to easily share the 3D data that a\nProject Tango device gathers. In this way, other developers could benefit from\nthe data captured by others – using another user’s 3D map of a museum, for\nexample, to build a guide app.\n\n## When will it arrive?\n\nGoogle has partnered with Lenovo to make the world’s first Project Tango-\npowered smartphone, which is available now for £499.99. Lenovo describes the\nTango element of the phone as follows: “All you have to do is look through the\nPhab 2 Pro, and you’ll see objects and information overlaid onto the real\nworld. You can use these features for both practical purposes and fun: measure\nitems with just your phone, see how new furniture or decor will look in your\nhome, and even raise virtual pets, to name a few.”\n\nMeanwhile, Asus used CES 2017 to unveil its Tango-equipped equivalent in the\nform of the Zenfone 3 AR. The Project Tango cameras and sensors use spacial\nrecognition to overlay virtual objects onto a live feed of what the camera is\nseeing in real-time.\n\n![ZenFone AR\nevleaks](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nExamples of useful AR include previewing how furniture will look in your house\nand how clothes will look on a mock-up of your body type. Fashion brand GAP\ndemonstrated a new shopping app that lets you enter your measurements and try\non clothes on a virtual version of yourself, applying a physics engine to see\nhow the clothes will fit and fall on your body.\n\nUnfortunately there’s no confirmed price or release date for the Zenfone 3 AR\nat this point, but the handset will launch in the second quarter of 2016\naccording to the company.\n\n**Related:[ What is virtual\nreality?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/what-is-virtual-reality)**\n\n![LenovoProjectTango1](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Project Tango at Google I/O 2016\n\nPerhaps the most exciting Tango developments to come out of Google’s developer\nconference last year was when Johnny Lee (via\n[VentureBeat](http://venturebeat.com/2016/05/19/google-project-tango-\nresearch/)) showed a video demonstrating various research projects that were\nunderway. This included ultra-precise indoor navigation in use, complete with\na waypoint overlay on the phone’s display, which looks a bit like a modern\nfirst person shooter game, except those little digital breadcrumbs lead to a\ndelicious meal or an important appointment rather than a virtual bloodbath.\n\nAlso shown off was the potential to map large buildings in 3D from the\noutside, while another demo showed how Project Tango could detect and remove\nmoving objects from a captured 3D image. Google even showed off how Project\nTango could help space robotics, enabling operators to accurately track the\nposition and movements of their robots from thousands of miles away.\n\n**WATCH: What’s the no.1 smartphone in the world?  \n**\n\n****\n\nAre you excited for Google’s AR project to hit the market?
