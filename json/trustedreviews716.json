The design, foldable screen,\nand UI of the FlexPai are pretty rough, to put it kindly, so it’s best to\nthink of the device as an advanced prototype of sorts.\n\nJust announced in China, the FlexPai is available in three configurations –\n6GB of RAM with 128GB of on-board storage, 8GB/256GB and 8GB/512GB – and while\nfar from perfect, it does provide a tantalising glimpse of what the future\ncould look like when devices like the [Samsung Galaxy\nX](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-x-release-date-specs-\nprice-2951423) start coming to market.\n\nWhen folded out into tablet form, the FlexPai offers a 7.8-inch display, while\nits ‘handset’ mode sees it fold pretty much in half to 4 inches.\n\nPerhaps most interestingly, the FlexPai is the first device we’ve seen to use\na 7nm Qualcomm SoC. Only the forthcoming Snapdragon 8150 – which is the\nmarketing name for what will likely end up in devices like the [Galaxy\nS10](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/galaxy-s10-release-date-specs-\nrumours-3456012) next year as the Snapdragon 855 – is a match for that, based\non Qualcomm’s product development roadmap.\n\nElsewhere, the FlexPai runs a custom Android fork called Water OS and features\na dual camera setup comprised of a 16-megapixel module and a 20-megapixel\ntelephones lens.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![FlexPai](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### The Royole FlexPai is the world’s first foldable phone you can actually\nbuy\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/royole-flexpai-foldable-phone-3613773\n\"The Royole FlexPai is the world’s first foldable phone you can actually buy\")\n\n  * [ ![Blizzcon 2018](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### BlizzCon 2018: All you need to know before this weekend’s huge convention\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/blizzcon-2018-news-dates-virtual-ticket-\ngoody-bag-schedule-3603422 \"BlizzCon 2018: All you need to know before this\nweekend’s huge convention\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Honor Magic 2](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Honor Magic 2 slides into view with six cameras and a notch-killing design\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/honor-magic-2-release-date-price-3613766\n\"Honor Magic 2 slides into view with six cameras and a notch-killing design\")\n\n  * \n\nAs we mentioned, you can pre-order the developer versions of the FlexPai on\nRoyole’s [website](http://www.royole.com/flexpai-black-8g-for-dev), with the\ncompany saying it hopes to start sending out devices in “late December”. The\nFlexPai is priced at Chinese ¥8999-12,999, depending on which specs you opt\nfor for, which works out at around £1000-£1500 before shipping costs and\ntaxes, so owning a glimpse of the future isn’t exactly cheap.\n\n**What do you make the Royole FlexPai?
