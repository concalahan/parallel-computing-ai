In effect this means that you should be able to record video\nfor a massive four hours, or stream it continuously for 11.\n\nAll in all, the chipset paints a pretty impressive picture for what we can\nexpect from mid-range devices launching later in 2018, but of course we’ll\nhave to wait and see for what manufacturers make of the chipset before giving\nour final verdict.\n\n**Are you content to buy a mid-range handset these days or do you find\nyourself still going for the best of the best?
