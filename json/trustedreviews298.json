You could either\ngrapple yourself towards elements in the environment or else take things a\nstep further by attaching two objects together with it.\n\nWhat’s new is its customisability. Hopping into a menu lets you change its\nfunctionality, so rather than attracting two objects together, you can have\nthem propel each other away, or propel themselves through the air with\nreckless abandon.\n\nThis was especially useful at one point in our demonstration when we were\nshown how this could be used to get a crane to spin on its axis, turning the\nshipping container it was holding into a wrecking ball.\n\nAlternatively, you can attach small balloons, similar to the fulton extractors\nfound in the Metal Gear series, to have objects float up into the air.\nCombined with the boosters outlined above, you can turn items into\ngravitating, rocket-powered, battering rams.\n\n**Related:[Final Fantasy 7 Remake](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/final-\nfantasy-7-remake-release-date-2993127) **\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nHaving this much control over your environment is helpful when the environment\ncan turn on you at a moment’s notice, with tornadoes sent through missions to\nsuck everything from airplanes to bridges up into the sky.\n\nOne such segment allowed our demonstrator to show off perfectly how the\nenvironment can be both a useful ally and a formidable foe. The mission began\nwith Rico in a storm chaser truck, a vehicle so heavy that it can’t be thrown\ninto the air by winds strong enough.\n\nTraditionally we believe it’s customary to run away from environmental events\nlike hurricanes, but our demonstrator had other ideas.\n\nInstead, he barrelled towards the chaos, and soon we were at an airport, using\na variety of weapons and items to take down four anti-aircraft guns.\n\n**Related:[Rage 2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/rage-2-gameplay-\nrelease-date-3472822) **\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe first and third were the most traditional. Rico pulled out a comedically\nbig railgun and shot at both of them until they exploded into a thousand\npieces (which, incidentally, appeared to immediately get sucked up into the\nstorm).\n\nHowever, it was with the second that the grappling hook came into play, with\nthe booster attachment used to send the gun emplacement flying from its perch.\n\nFor the fourth, Rico used a more traditional rocket launcher, although he set\nthe scene by throwing a small automated drone up into the air first to shoot\ndown any foot soldiers that were trying to take him down while he got to work\non the gun itself. This was a task made more difficult by the way the wind\nfrom the hurricane kept throwing off the aim of his rockets, but eventually,\nhe found success.\n\nWith the fourth gun destroyed, our gameplay demonstration came to a close.\n\n## First impressions\n\nFrom the looks of things, Avalanche has understood exactly how people like to\nplay a Just Cause game. The fourth entry is as much about being creative with\nyour destruction as it is about completing missions and it looks to be all the\nmore impressive as a result.\n\nIf Just Cause 4 can keep up a similar amount of variety throughout the entire\ngame, then it could end up being an exceptionally fun sandbox experience.\n\n**How do you like to play a Just Cause game?
