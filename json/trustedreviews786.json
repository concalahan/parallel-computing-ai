The device has been\nnicknamed Angler, the report says, and will likely to pioneer the Android M\noperating system.\n\nAs for the Huawei ‘Bullhead’ phone, well it’ll have a 5.7-inch display\ncomplete with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor. Naturally, it should also\narrive on the scene carrying Android M.\n\nDon’t look for either device when Google takes the stage on to unveil the new\nOS on Thursday at Google I/O. It’s probable both will turn up around October,\nas the Nexus 6 did last year.\n\nGiven the unfavourable reception offered to the unwieldy [Nexus\n6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/nexus-6-review) phone, manufactured by\nMotorola, it has been questioned whether Google would return to the Nexus\nbrand.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nDuring its recent quarterly earnings report, Google admitted the preference of\nthe Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 hadn’t been as strong as previous years’ offerings.  \n **  \nRead more:[Nexus 9 review](https://www.trustedreviews.com/nexus-9-review)**\n\nIt’ll be interesting to see how Google offsets and its partners offsets the\nslump with the next breed of Nexus handsets and Android M.\n\nLG of course has experienced previous success in the market with the extremely\nwell-received Nexus 4 and Nexus 5, but this’ll be the first time Huawei has\nbeen enlisted by Google, if the reports turn out to be true.  \n\n"}
