They were part of a wider installation, intended to\nshowcase how machines are often ill used for surveillance and voyeurism,\naccording to Walker.\n\n**Related:[CES 2018\nhighlights](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ces-2018-live-news-\nhighlights-3350586)**\n\nWalker also said he worried about the development of ‘sex robots’,\n[telling](https://www.recode.net/2018/1/9/16870894/ces-2018-pole-dancing-\nrobots-giles-walker-strip-club-las-vegas) _Recode_ :\n\n> “My worry is — and this is really crude, but it is a crude idea — if you\nbuild a robot that you can have sex with, then you can build a robot that you\ncan rape, and you can build a child robot that you can have sex with, and it’s\nall supposedly legal. But [just] because it’s legal, does that mean it’s a\nhealthy thing? The dark side of the sex industry will create some really\nnasty, nasty stuff, and I think, ‘Is it worth it?’”\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nIt doesn’t look like the club’s (human) dancers are worried about their\nmechanical competition, though.\n\n“There are a lot of people with weird fetishes, so I am sure somebody will get\nturned on by them,” one of the club’s performers revealed to _AFP\n(_[via](https://phys.org/news/2018-01-pole-dancing-robots-aim-spice-nerd.html)\n_Phys.or_ g). “But nobody can beat the beauty of someone, and our talent with\nour brains, the way we talk.”\n\n“We can make people feel better than them.”\n\nA strange side attraction at an otherwise not-so-strange trade show? Or the\nultimate encapsulation of the ongoing row about CES, the tech industry, and\nsexism? You decide.\n\n**Would you like to see the robo-strippers in a strip club near you?
