It features\nnear-[Google Pixelbook](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/pixelbook)\nlevel specs and a nifty 360 hinge that lets you turn it into a tablet by\nfolding the screen all the way round.\n\nThe design, coupled with the 4K screen option and robust 10 hour battery life\ncould make it a solid choice for entertainment fanatics as well as power\nusers. We’ll be interested to see how it compares to its slightly cheaper $599\n(roughly £460) rival, the Dell Inspiron Chromebook 14, which has an included\nWacom stylus, but no 4K screen option.\n\nAs ever, we’re always cautious about recommending top-end Chromebooks to\nregular people as the software is heavily tied to Google. You’ll only be able\nto run Chrome Store and Web apps when it first comes out. This’ll be an issue\nfor creatives that do serious photography or design work using software like\nAdobe Photoshop or Illustrator.\n\nThat said, with Google working hard to make it easier to get Android apps\nrunning on Chrome this could change change pretty soon.\n\n**Related:[Best laptop for students](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nstudent-laptop-3444216)**\n\n## Lenovo Chromebook C330\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Key features:**\n\n  * MediaTek MTK8173C Processor\n  * 11.6-inch HD (1366 x 768) IPS display\n  * 4 GB LPDDR3\n  * Storage 32 GB/64 GB eMMC 5.1\n  * 10 hour quoted battery life\n  * **Price:** €349 (roughly £310)\n  * **Release date:** November (EMEA)\n\nThe Chromebook C330 is the middle child in Lenovo’s Chrome OS laptop lineup.\nSet to retail for €349 (roughly £310) it has a similar entertainment and\ncasual web browsing focus to the larger Yoga, but is for people that aren’t\ninterested in streaming 4K.\n\nThe Mediatek CPU and 4GB RAM should be more than enough for Chrome OS and\ncapable of basic web browsing, office work and video streaming, but we\nwouldn’t expect a lot else out of it.\n\nThe key selling point will be it’s colourful convertible design. Like the\nlarger Yoga the laptop can be set in laptop, tent or tablet modes and features\na touch enabled display. The smaller 11-inch form factor will also make it a\nbetter option for people looking for a satchel friendly Chromebook they can\ncarry to work or class.\n\nThe price puts It in the same market segment as the €349 ( roughly £313) Acer\nChromebook 514, which features a slightly more premium looking mixed metal and\nglass design and 14-inch form factor.\n\n## Lenovo Chromebook\nS330![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \n\n**Key features:**\n\n  * MediaTek MTK8173C Processor\n  * 14-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) TN and HD (1366 x 768) TN display options\n  * 4 GB LPDDR3\n  * Storage 32 GB/64 GB eMMC 5.1\n  * 10 hour quoted battery life\n  * **Price:** €279 (roughly £250)\n  * **Release date:** November (EMEA)\n\nThis is about a standard a Chromebook as you’ll find. It targets the same\naffordable end of the market as past Chromebooks, like the Acer Chromebook 14,\nand lacks the convertible touchscreen of its bigger brothers.\n\nDon’t expect to be able to put this laptop into tablet or tent mode then.\n\nIt is the most affordable option in Lenovo’s current Chrome OS laptop line-up.\nIt features a larger 14-inch screen than the C330, but other than that its\nspecs are near identical to the C330.\n\n**Excited about all the new Chromebooks coming out of IFA?
