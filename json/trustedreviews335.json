It’s also possible to use\nTurbo Boost 3.0 to further speed up the clock-rate on the fastest two cores,\ngiving a maximum clock speed of 4.4Ghz. That’s only marginally lower than the\n4.5GHz achieved by Intel’s Core i7-7700K, the current top-end consumer desktop\nprocessor.\n\nWe also know that the 16-core model will be capable of speeds between 2.8GHz\nand 4.4GHz, and that the 14-core variant will have a base clock-rate of\n3.1GHz.\n\nWe don’t have proper benchmark results yet, but Intel has offered up some of\nits own testing readouts. In Cinebench R15, the 16-core i9 chip managed a\nscore of 3,200 – that’s paired with Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1080Ti GPU.\n\nThe 14-core, 16-core, and 18-core Intel Core i9 chips will go on sale on\nSeptember 25, but the 12-core version is available as soon as August 28. The\ntop-end 18-core model will set you back $2,000 USD.\n\n_Original article (May 15, 2017):_\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nIntel’s next-generation workstation CPUs will include a new model name, called\nCore i9. This forms the very top end of Intel’s X-series of procesors, which\nwas previously topped by a load of different Core i7s.\n\nSpecifically, there are five new Intel Core i9 chips, all of which feature 10\nor more cores, with the top-end i9-7980XE packing a ridiculous 18 cores – the\nmost ever for an Intel desktop part.\n\n**Related:[Best CPU for gaming](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-cpu-\nfor-gaming \"Best CPU for gaming\")**\n\nThere’s also three new i7 chips and an i5 processor joining the new i9 chips,\nincluding the quad-core i5-7640X and i7 models in 4, 6 and 8-core variants.\n\nThe cheaper chips will rival AMD’s top-end Ryzen processors, featuring higher\nclock speeds and support for more PCIe lanes – both of which are important for\nhigh-end PCs that pack powerful components, like multiple graphics cards and\nhigh-speed storage arrays.\n\n![intel core\nx](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nThe most expensive new additions are (on paper, at least) in a class of their\nown, with the Core i9-7980XE priced at $1,999 (about £1,558). It’s the first\nIntel consumer processor that comes with a teraflop of computing power.\nAlongside the 7980XE, there are 10, 12, 14 and 16-core i9 alternatives, with\nthe 10 core i9-7900X set to go on sale for $999 (about £778).\n\nAll Intel’s new i9 chips come with 3.3GHz base clock speeds, and are capable\nof reaching up to 4.3GHz dual-core speeds with Turbo Boost 2.0, pushing that\nto 4.5GHz with Turbo Boost 3.0.\n\nStay tuned for more from **[Computex\n2017](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/computex-2017-news-launches-nvidia-\nintel-amd-asus-microsoft-announcements \"Computex 2017\")** in Taipei as\nTrustedReviews will be providing updates live from the event.\n\n**Related:[Best gaming PC](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/best-gaming-pc\n\"Best Gaming PC\")**\n\n**Is Core i9 going into your next high-end rig or are you thinking Ryzen’s\nmore your cup of tea?
