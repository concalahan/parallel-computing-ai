There’s now another reason to get excited, as Warner Bros. has\nrevealed a partnership with HTC Vive to bring the film’s world direct to\nselect VR headsets.**\n\nIn an announcement, Warner Bros. said that [HTC\nVive](https://www.trustedreviews.com/htc-vive-review) will produce “multiple\npieces of VR content tied to the world of Ready Player One” that will be\navailable globally via the VR app store Viveport.\n\nIt’s not entirely clear whether the content will feature gamified scenarios\ninspired by the film’s story, or simply enable players to explore parts of the\nReady Player One world.\n\nWhat Warner Bros. has teased us with so far is that a series of “virtual\nreality content, experiences and activations” related to the film will be\navailable. It’s set to release on March 30, 2018.\n\nHowever it shapes up, it’s likely going to be a fascinating world to explore –\nand an entirely fitting move given the film is set in a VR world. Based on the\nbook by Ernest Cline, Ready Player One takes place in a virtual utopia\ncontaining ten-thousand planets called the OASIS.\n\nThe content will be aimed at both high-end PC-based VR systems and mobile\ndevices.\n\nAnyone itching for a preview of the content might catch it at some of the\nmajor consumer events throughout the year, where Vive is planning on\nshowcasing it – [E3 2017](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/e3-2017-games-\nnews-trailers) being one possibility.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nVive also plans to bring Ready Player One-inspired content to its Viveport\nArcade platform launching in April this year, which will make VR experiences\navailable at places like arcades, internet cafes and cinemas.\n\nAnd it’s not the only news out of Warner Bros., either, as the company has\nunveiled plans to produce, develop and release a trio of interactive VR\nexperiences based on more upcoming blockbusters in partnership with IMAX.\n\nJustice League and Aquaman are confirmed for the VR treatment, but a third\nmystery film is yet to be announced. As with Ready Player One, the experiences\nwill hit in-home and mobile VR platforms.\n\nWe can’t wait.\n\n**Related:[HTC Vive vs Oculus\nRift](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/oculus-rift-vs-htc-vive)**\n\n**What do you make of HTC’s latest Vive announcements?
