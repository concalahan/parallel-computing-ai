The phone’s design still\nmeasures up against more modern looking phones for the most part.\n\nNot all is top-drawer though. The antenna bands that snake their way around\nback and sides are hideously ugly, breaking up the otherwise seamless look.\n\n**Related:**[ **iPhone\n8**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-8-release-date-specs-rumours-\nprice-uk)\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nOn the side you’ve got the power-button and volume keys, with the headphone\njack and Lightning connector on the bottom. Below the display is the home-\nbutton with integrated Touch ID fingerprint sensor.\n\nUnlike on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 8, the button here is a physical key that\nmoves when you press it. Removing the mechanical button allowed the following\niPhones to boast a water-resistance rating.\n\n## **iPhone 6S – Screen**\n\nThe screen is not the very best there is – Samsung’s OLEDs are in a different\nleague – but it’s excellent for an LCD, even a few years on.\n\nContrast is great and colours are natural. Some might argue its 326 pixels per\ninch (ppi) isn’t sharp enough, but that argument doesn’t hold water with me.\nIt’s plenty sharp enough.\n\n**Related:**[ **iPhone\n9**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-9-release-date-specs-features-\nprice-rumours-uk-3297160)\n\n3D Touch is, without question, the defining feature of the iPhone 6S’ screen.\nIt lets the iPhone detect different levels of pressure and trigger new actions\ndepending on how hard you press.\n\nIt’s the kind of feature that demands exploration and experimentation from\nusers and developers alike. At first, you’ll explore the home screen –\npressing harder on icons to see what happens. Sometimes it’s nothing, which is\nfrustrating, but sometimes you’ll be\n\npresented with shortcuts to specific actions.\n\nFor example, using “3D Touch” on the Camera app icon brings up shortcuts to\ntake selfie or shoot a video. Try it on the Maps app and you can quickly share\nyour location or get directions home. The Music app will launch the Beats1\nradio station; the Calendar app will create a new event; the Wallet app will\nshow you your last transaction. You get the idea.\n\nAll these little shortcuts are useful, but it’s inside apps where 3D Touch\nshows real dividends. My favourite feature is pressing down on the keyboard to\ndrag the cursor around accurately. It’s a simple thing, but it makes\ncorrecting mistakes and basic editing simple and effortless.\n\n**Related:[Best smartphones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nsmartphone-3431175)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe other key strand of 3D Touch is what Apple calls ‘Peek’ and ‘Pop’. In\nshort, press hard to ‘Peek’ at the contents of an item (e.g. an email, message\nor hyperlink) and press harder still to ‘Pop’ that into full screen. Relaxing\nthe pressure, meanwhile, sends you back to where you came.\n\nIt that sounds naff and pointless to you, I assure you it isn’t. Mail and\nMessages are the best examples of how useful Peek and Pop is. Peeking into a\nmessage previews its contents without marking it as read, which shortens the\nirritating flow of checking a message, leaving it and then marking it as\nunread again to look at later.\n\nPeeking and then sliding the window upwards reveals further actions, such as\nsending a standard reply or forwarding it to someone else. It’s great for\nchecking a link to see if it’s genuinely useful, or you can slide it up and\nselect ‘Open in new Tab’.\n\nAll of this is enhanced by the new Taptic Engine – a redesigned motor and\nsoftware stack that delivers subtler, smarter taptic events.\n\nI like it even more than 3D Touch itself. The way the Taptic Engine delivers\nshort, precise and gentle ‘blips’ adds a new dimension to notifications.\nYou’ll quickly learn the pattern and character of these vibrations, so you can\ninstantly discern what kind of alert you’re getting without looking. You can\ncustomise them to an extent, too.\n\nIt’s a far cry from the iPhone 5 and 5S, which rumbled fiercely with all the\nsubtlety of a small, yappy dog. Once you’ve used the iPhone 6S and experienced\nthe difference, you’ll wonder how you ever put with that racket. It’s great.\n\nThe only downside is that, making room for the new Taptic Engine that helps\npower 3D Touch means a small, 5% reduction in battery capacity.\n\n## **iPhone 6S – Camera**\n\nOn paper alone, there are legitimate reasons to be disappointed with the\niPhone 6S’ camera. When it was first released the bump from 8-megapixels to\n12-megapixels was very welcome. The fact Apple hadn’t upgraded the lens\nwasn’t. The iPhone 6S has an f/2.2 aperture lens, which is narrow by today’s\nstandards.\n\nThis is important because a ‘wider’ aperture lets in more light onto the\nsensor. More light leads to better low light performance and superior ‘depth\nof field’ – where the background is blurred behind your subject.\n\nThe latter quality, often referred to as ‘bokeh’ – choose your own\npronunciation of that one – is the desirable effect that gives photos that\nprofessional sheen.\n\nIt would be nicer still if the iPhone 6S had optical image stabilisation (OIS)\nas its ability to counter shaky hand motions would help low light performance\neven more, but that’s reserved for the larger iPhone 6S Plus for size reasons.\nThis is arguably a greater loss than a faster lens, but you’ll only miss it\nwhen shooting in very low light, or for video.\n\n![iPhone 6S camera photos\n15](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe iPhone 6S controls noise a little better and retains the contours of the\npetal as a result. It’s all fine margins, but it’s a good start.\n\nHDR is an especially useful technique that combines different ‘exposures’ of\nthe same shot. This helps resolve extremes of light and dark that a single\nshot can’t.\n\nBut it reinforces how the iPhone 6S remains an outstanding cameraphone. It\nrenders colours faithfully with nice, smooth gradations that bring out the\nsubtleties of shots, and it has excellent native dynamic range.\n\n![iPhone 6S camera photos\n19](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe vegetable stand above shows this nicely where the pumpkins (centre of\nshot) transition from red to orange.\n\nThe iPhone 6 produces a usable(ish) shot for social media, but it’s blotchy\nand struggles to control refractions from the bright lights.\n\n![iPhone 6S camera\nphotos](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n![iPhone 6S camera photos\n5](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nThe noise in the dark sky of the 6S shot is much finer and controlled, and the\nlights don’t cause such serious problems. It’s a decent effort, but there are\nbetter.\n\nNeedless to say, the differences between the iPhone 6S and iPhone 5S are more\nextreme. We’ll explore this in a future update to our[ iPhone 6S vs iPhone\n5S](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/iphone-6-vs-iphone-5s) comparison,\nbut the words “no contest” spring to mind.\n\nBeyond pure image quality, there are noticeable improvements in performance,\ntoo. The iPhone 6S focusses faster than the iPhone 6 for one as it spends less\ntime hunting back and forth.\n\nApple has lavished the iPhone 6S with a serious front camera upgrade this time\naround. It’s up from 1.2-megapixels to 5-megapixels, a pixel increase that has\nmore in common with the inflation rate of your average banana republic.\n\nThe ‘screen flash’ is handy in dingy indoor lighting, the primary locale for\nthe selfie. Like the dual-tone LED flash at the rear, the screen uses a flesh\ntone to avoid turning you too ghostly. It’s effective, too, aside from the odd\nwhite spot on my nose. Is “shiny nose” a thing?\n\nIncidentally, Apple’s resisted the trend for strapping wide angle lenses on\nthe front of phones. This makes it tricky to take ‘groufies’ without one of\nthose stick-o-ma-bobs (umbrella’s, I think?), but affords just enough space to\nshow how awesome your holiday destination is while you gurn furiously in the\nforeground.\n\nThe iPhone 6S’s video capabilities are good. It’s only held back, again, by\nthe lack of optical image stabilisation, which is handy for suppressing shaky\nhands.\n\nThere are two video modes and six settings in total: 720p at 30fps, 1080p at\n30fps, 1080p at 60fps, 4K at 30fps and the two slo-mo modes, 720p at 120fps\nand 240fps.\n\nThe 240fps mode introduced on the iPhone 6 is especially fun. The 60fps 1080p\nmode is interesting since it delivers smoother motion, though be warned it’s\nunusable in low light. As is 4K for that matter. The default mode is 1080p at\n30fps, which is perfect for most conditions.\n\nMoreover, while it’s easy to dismiss the addition of 4K as “pointless”, don’t\nbe too hasty. For one, downscaling 4K footage to 1080p will result in sharper\nfooting than native 1080p. The adventurous can even use 4K’s extra pixels to\nreframe and ‘zoom’ into their footage at 1080p without losing detail – 4K is\neffectively four times 1080p, after all.\n\nInexplicably, though, you can’t change the standard video and slo-mo options\nfrom within the Camera app. You have to delve into the Photos & Camera section\nof the Settings app to change the defaults every time, a decision so\ninexplicably stupid it defies belief.\n\nIt’s odd because the iPhone’s Camera app is impeccably designed otherwise.\n\n## **iPhone 6S – Software**\n\nOn release the iPhone ran iOS 9, buy one today though and you’ll be upgrading\nto iOS 11.\n\n[iOS 11](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/ios-11) is arguably the\nbiggest issue with the phone right now. It feels like an OS designed for\nApple’s newer phones, rather than the older ones. Thankfully that should\nchange when iOS 12 hits later in the year.\n\niOS 12 is an update less about bringing in new features (though, of course\nthere are still a few) but fixing performance and stability on older phones.\nApple says that everything from keyboard speed to camera performance should be\nimproved and this could be a big boost for the iPhone 6S.Expect to see iOS 12\nlaunch probably in September and we’ll fully re-review the iPhone 6S once it\nis out. There’s a public and dev preview available now, if you want to take it\nfor a spin.\n\niOS 12 features that aren’t related to performance include a Screen Time\nfeature for restricting and tracking time spent in certain apps, updated\nnotifications and a few redesigned core apps like News and Books. All the of\nthese features will also come to the iPhone 6S.\n\n## **iPhone 6S – Performance**\n\nThe iPhone 6S is hell-a-fast, which is apparently not as fast as “stupidfast”\nbut is nonetheless pretty nippy.\n\nApple’s A9 SoC (System on a Chip) houses a shiny new PowerVR GPU and two CPU\ncores clocked at 1.8GHz each, up from 1.4GHz, and there’s 2GB of RAM.\n\nHaving two whole gigabytes of RAM isn’t a big deal these days, Android phones\ngenerally have at least 4-6GB. But the iPhone 6S runs fine with it.\n\nWith the iPhone 6S, I’ve managed to switch between as many as 10 tabs in\nSafari simultaneously loaded tabs without any reloads.\n\nYou could probably load a few more, but by that point I was satisfied. They’ll\nstill reload if you leave the app and come back some time later, but in the\ntime you’re active within Safari it handles the workload well.\n\n**Related:[Best tablet 2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\ntablets)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\niPhone 5S and iPhone 6 owners will notice unlocking from Touch ID is faster,\ntoo, especially when the screen is already off. It’s only a small point, but\neach fraction makes the whole experience feel smoother and slicker.\n\nThere’s an enviable amount of graphics grunt on tap, too – not that any game\nI’ve found makes full use of it yet.\n\n## **iPhone 6S – Battery Life**\n\n“Battery life could be a problem,” was my first thought when I started my\niPhone 6S review, and with good reason. Wonderful though 3D Touch and the\nTaptic Engine are, Apple had to reduce the battery capacity from 1,810mAh to\n1,715mAh to fit them in. It made the 6S slightly thicker and heavier, too,\nthough not enough that anyone should care.\n\nThe iPhone 6 didn’t have a stellar reputation for battery life, and while some\nof those complaints are overblown, they’re not without foundation. Certainly,\nthe ‘Plus’ variant is the phone to go for if you suffer range “range anxiety”.\n\nFor whatever reason, the Facebook app uses more background time than other\napp. Before the change Facebook was responsible for close to 25% of the\nphone’s battery drain, despite being on screen for just 20 minutes or so. iOS\n9’s improved battery monitoring was a godsend here.\n\nNavigation puts a big strain on the battery, though, particularly in built-up\nareas. One 15-minute walk with directions drained 7% from the battery.\nStreaming video over Wi-Fi burns through around 12% of battery per hour,\ndepending on the quality and how bright your screen is.\n\nThe Low Power won’t extend your life indefinitely, but it’s useful and\neffective enough. iOS prompts you to turn it on when your battery hits 20% and\nit turns off all background activity, while also throttling down the CPU and\nGPU.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe iPhone is already frugal when idle, but Low Power extends that further\nstill – I once got five hours of very light use after passing 20%, which is\nhandy if you’re staying out late. And you can turn Low Power on earlier if you\nknow you have a long day ahead – the iPhone 6S runs fine when it’s on.\n\nUltimately, while some management is needed from time to time, I never felt\nlike I would run out before I got home, and it would only concern me if I was\non a “night out” and got home late. In those cases, a few simple precautions\nwill avert problems.\n\nPower users who stream video all day, use navigation lots or play games often\nshould look at the 6S Plus, but the 6S’s battery life is fine for the majority\nof people.\n\n## **Why buy the iPhone 6S?**\n\nFor the current RRP of £449, the iPhone 6S is far too expensive. There’s just\ntoo many better options out there for the same price. iOS 12 will likely make\nit a much better device, but that isn’t here yet and there are notable\nperformance problems on older iPhones with iOS 11.\n\n**Related:[How to download iOS 12](https://www.trustedreviews.com/how-\nto/ios-12-beta-download-3481261)**\n\nIf you can pick the iPhone 6S up cheaper and you simply must have an iOS phone\nthen you might even see benefits with installing the iOS 12 public beta.\n\n## **Verdict**\n\nStill good in many ways, but it’ll benefit a lot from iOS 12.\n\n## Score\n\n  \n\n### Score in detail\n\n  * Performance 10\n\n  * Camera 9\n\n  * Design 9\n\n  * Battery Life 7\n\n  * Value 8\n\n  * Software 9\n\n  * Calls & Sound 8\n\n  * Screen Quality 9\n\n"}
