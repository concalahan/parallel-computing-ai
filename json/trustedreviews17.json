Or is better just to skip them all? Allow us to\nexplain.\n\nYes, that’s right. Apple ditched the iPhone 7S and jumped straight to the\n[iPhone 8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-8-release-date-specs-\nrumours-price-uk-2993101), which is unusual in itself – but the surprises\ndon’t stop there. The iPhone X (or iPhone 10) is a special celebratory device\ndesigned to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the iPhone line, and it’s a\nradical departure from previous models.\n\nRead on to learn how the new handsets differ.\n\n## **iPhone X vs iPhone 8 Design: What’s the difference?**\n\nThe biggest difference between the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X is the\nindustrial design. Apple’s lack of real advancement in design dampened the\niPhone 7 and left us with a phone that felt the same as the iPhone 6.\n\n![iPhone\n8](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nThankfully, things are slightly different this year, but mostly just for the\niPhone X. Apple’s most ‘out-there’ phone design yet instantly makes the X\nstand out, even though it’s been leaked to death in the past few months. Like\nthe [Samsung Galaxy S8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-\ngalaxy-s8) and [LG V30](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/lg-v30), the\nscreen on the iPhone X stretches right to the edges and the once huge bezel\nhas been shrunk right down. It’s a striking, futuristic design that is so much\nmore eye-catching than your typical iPhone.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThe biggest design oddity will likely be the cut-out at the top that dips into\nthe screen. This houses a myriad of sensors and the front-facing camera, and\nit looks a lot like the [Essential\nPhone](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/andy-rubin-essential-phone-release-\ndate-revealed-next-week-3251699). It’ll be interesting to see whether or not\nhaving a portion of the screen blocked off will be annoying, but we suspect\nit’ll be easy to get used to. Both latest iPhones all have glass backs, which\nwe do think looks nice but we’re not convinced about its durability.\n\nEach new iPhone is water-resistant with the same IP67 rating as before, but\nthe iconic circular home-button that has sat below the display on every iPhone\nhas gone the way of the headphone jack on the iPhone X. That also means that\nTouch ID is now only available on the iPhone 8, not on the iPhone X. Instead,\nthe X benefits from a new feature called[ Face\nID](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/what-is-face-id-3286453). This face-\nscanning tech looks to be similar to the face recognition on the [Note\n8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-8), but you’ll\nbe able to use it for authorising iTunes purchases along with unlocking the\nphones.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nInstead of just being an aesthetic touch, the return to a glass back has\nallowed Apple to implement wireless charging into the iPhone line up for the\nfirst time. All the new phones benefit from this charging option, so it’s not\njust exclusive to the iPhone X.\n\n## **iPhone X vs iPhone 8 Specs: Which phone is more powerful?**\n\nThe iPhone 8 and iPhone X are powered by the [A11\nBionic](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-a11-processor-specs-\nperformance-benchmarks-3286346) chip, which is built using the same 10nm\nprocess as the [Snapdragon\n835](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/snapdragon-820-vs-\nsnapdragon-810-2926759). This new manufacturing process means a more efficient\ndevice with hopefully smoother performance and better battery life. Apple’s\nA11 CPU has two performance cores, which are 25% faster each than the iPhone\n7, plus four high-efficiency cores.\n\nThe iPhone 8 comes with 2GB RAM, while the iPhone X ups that to 3GB. Both are\nseriously fast phones though.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nBoth the iPhone 8 and iPhone X might have similar internals, but they’re very\ndifferent in terms of display. The iPhone X is the first of Apple’s phones to\nditch an IPS LCD display for OLED – the same screen tech used by Samsung and\nLG.\n\nOLED offers perfect blacks and much more vivid colours than LCD displays, and\nall the best phones use it. If you plump for the iPhone 8 or 8 Plus, you’ll be\nstuck with the IPS LCD panels. The OLED in the iPhone X is also Dolby Vision\nand HDR 10 capable. It also offers a much higher resolution 2436 x 1125,\nrather than 720p or 1080p.\n\n**Related: What is[Face ID](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/what-is-face-\nid-3286453)? | [What is HDR?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/how-to/how-to-\nfind-netflix-amazon-hdr-streams-2942413)**\n\n[iOS 11](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/ios-11) will come pre-\ninstalled on all the new phones and boasts new features like an improved Siri,\nbrand-new Control Center and a redesigned App Store. The Touch ID lacking\niPhone X will also have some exclusive iOS tweaks like the addition of a\nvirtual home button.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe cameras on the back of the iPhone X are similar to the ones on the iPhone\n8 Plus. The smaller iPhone 8 is still stuck with one 12MP sensor, both the 8\nPlus and have dual-12MP cameras with the extra sensor acting as an optical\ntelephoto zoom lens. The iPhone X benefits from OIS on both these sensors,\nwhereas the 8 Plus has it just on the regular sensor. Another exclusive\nfeature for the iPhone X is a new front-facing camera that can achieve similar\neffects to the Portrait Mode on the back.\n\n**Related:[Best iPhone X deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/best-\niphone-x-deals-3289493)**\n\n## **iPhone X vs iPhone 8 Price**\n\nThe iPhone 8 starts £/$699 for the smaller model for 64GB and £/$849 for the\n256GB model.
