Then read on.**\n\nJust when you thought Amazon had a comfortable grip on the smart speaker\nmarket, the retail giant kicked down the door and revealed major next-gen\nupdates across the entire [Echo\nrange](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/amazon-launches-new-echo-dot-echo-\nshow-and-echo-plus-and-introduces-echo-sub-for-more-bass-3585025). The\ndecision for which Amazon Echo device to buy this Christmas just got a lot\nharder.\n\nEcho devices always receive a significant price drop around Black Friday, and\nthe Echo Dot usually drops to £34.99. This year, things could get really\ninteresting, as there’s a new Echo Dot and an old Echo Dot. Most likely, the\nnew model will drop from £49.99 to £34.99. Currently, Amazon is selling the\nold model for £34.99, so this could get even cheaper for Black Friday and\ncould be the best-value Alexa-powered speaker that we’ve ever seen.\n\nLikewise, Amazon still has stock of the older Echo Show and Echo Plus smart\nspeakers, so expect these to face further price cuts in the future. We’re\nlisting the current products at the moment, but we’ll bring you the best deals\non the older products as they’re announced.\n\n**Related:[Black Friday 2018 UK](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-\nblack-friday-deals-2018-2952384)**\n\nIf you already have an idea of which Echo you’re after then feel free to\nscroll ahead to get straight to the deals – if you’re coming to the table\ncompletely blind then read on for a quick run-down of everything you need to\nknow.\n\nThe Amazon Echo range is a collection of smart speaker devices that can be\nused to perform a whole bunch of tasks from simply setting a timer to\ncontrolling the lighting in your home.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nEach Echo device runs on an artificial intelligence system known as Alexa,\nsimilar to Siri for Apple products and the Google Assistant for Google phones\nand smart speakers.\n\nThe versatility of the Echo range allows you to pick and choose the one that\nyou will benefit you the most.

The\nsecond gen Echo Show has increased the screen size from 7 inches to 10 inches,\nand stylised the previously bulky design with a fabric finish.\n\n### Best Echo Show (2nd Gen) Deals\n\n[](http://geni.us/echoshow2)\n\n[](http://geni.us/echoshow2)\n\n###\n\n[All-New Echo Show (2nd Gen), Black + Free Philips Hue White Bulb E27\n\n](http://geni.us/echoshow2)\n\nThe Echo Show was always a great product but it was hindered by lacklustre\ndesign.

At least, the new Echo Dot has\ncertainly learnt a thing or two from the design of the Home Mini, covering the\nedges in a fabric that makes it far more appealing to the average customer.\n\nUnder the hood, the Dot’s components have been updated to feature four far-\nfield microphones to pick up requests from quite a distance – something that\nI’ve always found particularly handy on the original Echo.\n\n### Best Echo Dot 3rd Generation Deals\n\n[](http://geni.us/echodot3)\n\n[](http://geni.us/echodot3)\n\n###\n\n[All-new Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – Charcoal Fabric\n\n](http://geni.us/echodot3)\n\nThe Echo Dot was always great value for money but with its new design, the Dot\nis finally as visually appealing as the Google Home Mini, making it a serious\ncontender as your go-to smart speaker.\n\n[Amazon\n\n](http://geni.us/echodot3)\n\n|\n\nNow £49.99 / $49.99\n\n[View Deal](http://geni.us/echodot3)\n\nNow £49.99 / $49.99\n\n|\n\n[Amazon\n\n](http://geni.us/echodot3)\n\n[](https://amzn.to/2RRglqZ)\n\n[](https://amzn.to/2RRglqZ)\n\n###\n\n[All-new Echo Dot (3rd Gen), Black + Philips Hue White and Color Starter Kit\nB22\n\n](https://amzn.to/2RRglqZ)\n\nIf you fancy kitting out your home with a new smart speaker and smart lighting\nfor just a fraction of the usual price, then this deal is the one for you.\n\n[Amazon\n\n](https://amzn.to/2RRglqZ)\n\n|\n\nSave £26\n\n|\n\nNow £119.99\n\n[View Deal](https://amzn.to/2RRglqZ)\n\nNow £119.99\n\n|\n\nSave £26\n\n|\n\n[Amazon\n\n](https://amzn.to/2RRglqZ)\n\n* * *\n\n![Echo Plus 2nd\nGen](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Echo Plus\n\nThe Echo Plus’ main selling point was always its inclusion of a Zigbee hub,\nwhich negates the need for a separate device to control your smart lighting\nand such, and nothing much has changed on that front.\n\nThe only major difference with the new Echo Plus is its 360-degree speaker,\nwhich makes for a far better listening experience that’s on-par with most\nsmart speakers.\n\n### Best Echo Plus (2nd Gen) Deals\n\n[](geni.us/echoplus2)\n\n[](geni.us/echoplus2)\n\n###\n\n[All-new Echo Plus (2nd gen), Charcoal Fabric + Philips Hue White bulb E27\n\n](geni.us/echoplus2)\n\nSimilar to the previous Echo Plus, the 2nd gen model also includes a Zigbee\nhub to control your smart home but this time around the device also has\n360-degree speaker.
