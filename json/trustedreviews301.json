It’s basically a clone of the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, with afew additional features. We gave the Galaxy S7 a 10/10 score, and the GalaxyS7 Edge a 9/10 score, and they’re both fantastic, easy-to-recommend handsets.The main roadblock when it comes to buying the Galaxy Note 7 is almost certainto be price – Note handsets are very expensive. But if you’re already a Noteuser then you know that, and you’re probably willing to shell out for whatpotentially is the best (but not necessarily best-value) phone of the year.If you’re considering buying an alternative to the Note 7, the Note 4 ispossibly a little old. The Note 5 is a strong contender, and will save you£200-300. The Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge are also both cheaper, and notsignificantly different in terms of specs.If you want what is probably the most powerful phone available right now, andmoney is no object, buy the Galaxy Note 7. But if you’re a little morediscerning, there are arguably better deals to be had with other Samsunghandsets.(uswitch type=table brand=Samsung model=Galaxy_Note_7 limit=1)**Related:[Samsung Galaxy S8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s8-release-date-specs-rumours-price-uk)****What do you think of the Galaxy Note 7?
