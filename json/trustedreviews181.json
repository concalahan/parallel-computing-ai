What we didn’t know was that Amazon\nwas planning to revamp almost the entire line-up, and introduce two new\nproducts: the Echo Sub and the Amazon Smart Plug.**\n\n## Amazon Echo Dot (3rd Gen)\n\nThe [Echo Dot](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/amazon-echo-dot-review)\nhas remained one of the most interesting and useful Alexa devices, offering a\ncheap way to introduce voice control to any room. With the new version, Amazon\nis promising better sound quality. Without having tested it, it’s likely that\nimproved sound quality will make Alexa easier to hear, but we still can’t\nimagine this model being a great option for music.\n\nHowever, a 3.5mm audio output and Bluetooth at least give options for hooking\nthe Echo Dot up to a more powerful stereo system.\n\nThis time around, Amazon has reduced the seven-microphone array used in the\noriginal Echo Dot, replacing it with four far-field microphones. Presumably,\nthe quality of the new microphones exceeds those in the original design, but\nwe’ll have to wait until we get a review sample.\n\nThe one thing that we can say with certainty is that the new Echo Dot is far\nmore attractive than the old one, finished with material around the edge. This\nmakes it closer in looks to the [Google Home\nMini](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-home-mini). It’s available\nfor pre-order now and will launch on October 11 2018.\n\n### Best Echo Dot 3rd Generation Deals\n\n[](http://geni.us/echodot3)\n\n[](http://geni.us/echodot3)\n\n###\n\n[All-new Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – Charcoal Fabric\n\n](http://geni.us/echodot3)\n\nThe Echo Dot was always great value for money but with its new design, the Dot\nis finally as visually appealing as the Google Home Mini, making it a serious\ncontender as your go-to smart speaker.\n\n[Amazon\n\n](http://geni.us/echodot3)\n\n|\n\nNow £49.99 / $49.99\n\n[View Deal](http://geni.us/echodot3)\n\nNow £49.99 / $49.99\n\n|\n\n[Amazon\n\n](http://geni.us/echodot3)\n\n[](https://amzn.to/2RRglqZ)\n\n[](https://amzn.to/2RRglqZ)\n\n###\n\n[All-new Echo Dot (3rd Gen), Black + Philips Hue White and Color Starter Kit\nB22\n\n](https://amzn.to/2RRglqZ)\n\nIf you fancy kitting out your home with a new smart speaker and smart lighting\nfor just a fraction of the usual price, then this deal is the one for you.\n\n[Amazon\n\n](https://amzn.to/2RRglqZ)\n\n|\n\nSave £26\n\n|\n\nNow £119.99\n\n[View Deal](https://amzn.to/2RRglqZ)\n\nNow £119.99\n\n|\n\nSave £26\n\n|\n\n[Amazon\n\n](https://amzn.to/2RRglqZ)\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Amazon Echo Show (2nd Gen)\n\nIn many ways, the [Echo Show](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/amazon-\necho-show) was the best device Amazon had launched. With its built-in screen,\nthe Show could respond visually and verbally to your requests, which made it\neasier to use. And, its 7-inch screen allowed you to watch Amazon Prime Video\nshows, too, with the high-quality audio proving to be clear and detailed.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nWith the new Echo Show, Amazon has upgraded the screen to a 10-inch HD affair,\nwhich should improve the video-watching experience. Dual 2-inch drivers, a\npassive bass radiator and Dolby processing should keep audio quality up.\n\nWhile the original product was a little basic with its plastic body, the new\nEcho Show has a new fabric cover, making it look far more like a premium\ndevice.\n\nAmazon has built a Zigbee hub into this model, so you can connect compatible\ndevices directly to it, such as Philips Hue bulbs. That’s quite useful, though\nunless Amazon has revamped the software, direct control of Hue bulbs won’t be\nas good as if you bought a Hue Hub.\n\nIt’s good to see that Amazon is bringing notifications and two-way audio for\nyour “front-door camera stream”. Presumably, this will let the [Ring Video\nDoorbell 2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/ring-video-doorbell-2)\nintegrate more tightly with Alexa, which makes sense given that Amazon has\npurchased Ring. It’s not clear if other products will be supported, such as\nthe [Nest Hello](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nest-hello). As with\nthe Echo Dot (2nd Gen), the new Echo Show can be pre-ordered now and will\nlaunch on October 11 2018.\n\n### Best Echo Show (2nd Gen) Deals\n\n[](http://geni.us/echoshow2)\n\n[](http://geni.us/echoshow2)\n\n###\n\n[All-New Echo Show (2nd Gen), Black + Free Philips Hue White Bulb E27\n\n](http://geni.us/echoshow2)\n\nThe Echo Show was always a great product but it was hindered by lacklustre\ndesign. Not anymore. The all-new second gen Echo Show features a larger screen\nand a gorgeous fabric cover to make it seamlessly blend in with the decor of\nyour home. This bundle also includes a free Philips Hue White Bulb.\n\n[Amazon\n\n](http://geni.us/echoshow2)\n\n|\n\nSave £14.74\n\n|\n\nNow £219.99 / $219.99\n\n[View Deal](http://geni.us/echoshow2)\n\nNow £219.99 / $219.99\n\n|\n\nSave £14.74\n\n|\n\n[Amazon\n\n](http://geni.us/echoshow2)\n\n[**Related: Nest Hello vs Ring Video Doorbell\n2**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/nest-hello-vs-ring-video-\ndoorbell-2-smart-doorbell-best-3540486)\n\n![Echo Show 2nd\nGen](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Amazon Echo Plus (2nd Gen)\n\nThe original [Echo Plus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/amazon-echo-\nplus) was basically an original Echo with slightly upgraded audio and a built-\nin Zigbee hub. This time around, the new Echo Plus still has the Zigbee hub,\nbut is a 360-degree speaker, designed to eliminate the listening sweet spot\nand project quality audio throughout a room.\n\nWe have the same reservations about the Zigbee hub as for the Echo, and it’ll\nbe interesting to see what, if anything, Amazon has done in-app to boost the\nrange of available features.\n\nWe’ll have to wait until we get a review sample to test the audio quality of\nthe Echo Plus, too. The new speaker can be pre-ordered now and will launch on\nOctober 11.\n\n### Best Echo Plus (2nd Gen) Deals\n\n[](geni.us/echoplus2)\n\n[](geni.us/echoplus2)\n\n###\n\n[All-new Echo Plus (2nd gen), Charcoal Fabric + Philips Hue White bulb E27\n\n](geni.us/echoplus2)\n\nSimilar to the previous Echo Plus, the 2nd gen model also includes a Zigbee\nhub to control your smart home but this time around the device also has\n360-degree speaker.

We’ll have\nto wait until we get our review sample to see how much difference the Sub\nmakes.

Integrating with Alexa, the\nsmart plug can be controlled using your voice or directly from the Alexa App\non your phone. It uses 2.4GHz Wi-Fi to connect to your home network, so\ndoesn’t need a smarthome hub.

Why might you want that, you may ask? Well, the answer is\nso that you can make an existing dumb speaker smart. The Echo Input hooks up\nto a speaker via its 3.5mm audio output or Bluetooth, and gives you Alexa\ncontrol through that. As a result, you save a bit of money over the Dot, and\nthe Echo Input will cost just £34.99.\n\nAt just 12.5mm tall, the Echo Input is also tiny, so it takes up even less\nspace than the Echo Dot. There’s no release date for the Echo Dot yet, but\nwe’ll bring you more information as we have it.\n\n### Best Echo Input Deals\n\n[](http://geni.us/echoinput)\n\n[](http://geni.us/echoinput)\n\n###\n\n[Echo Input\n\n](http://geni.us/echoinput)\n\nTaking the core concept of the original Echo Dot and stripping it down to its\nbare-bones, the Echo Input does the devilishly simple job of turning your\nregular everyday speaker into a smart speaker, powered by Alexa.\n\n[Amazon\n\n](http://geni.us/echoinput)\n\n|\n\nNow £34.99 / $34.99\n\n[View Deal](http://geni.us/echoinput)\n\nNow £34.99 / $34.99\n\n|\n\n[Amazon\n\n](http://geni.us/echoinput)\n\n![Echo ](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n"}
