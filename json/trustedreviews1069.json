Called Bixby, this assistant was designed to\ngo up against key rivals like Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, Microsoft’s\nCortana, and the Google Assistant on Android. But the global rollout of the\nsoftware has been slow and staggered, so few users will have actually taken\nadvantage of it.\n\nNonetheless, it appears Samsung is already gearing up to launch a new version\nof its relatively green assistant as soon as next week.\n\nA new report from the Korea Herald – based on Samsung’s home turf of South\nKorea – [suggests](http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20171012000864) that\nthe company hopes to make an announcement on October 18. This supposed Bixby\n2.0 reveal will reportedly take place at the company’s annual Developer\nConference in San Francisco on that day.\n\nIt’s not a huge surprise; Samsung recently appointed a new executive to lead\ndevelopment of the Bixby voice assistant to improve performance. It’s believed\nthat Samsung is unhappy with reception to the assistant software, given how\nwell-received rivals like Alexa have been.\n\nAccording to reports, Samsung is hoping to “supplement the incomplete parts of\nBixby 1.0” with Bixby 2.0. It’s believed that absent features were the result\nof a time shortage.\n\nUnfortunately, Samsung hasn’t officially confirmed that Bixby 2.0 is coming at\nthe Samsung Developer Conference next week, so take this report with due\ncaution for now.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n**Related:[Samsung Galaxy S9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-\ngalaxy-s9-release-date-specs-features-price-uk-3266552)**\n\n**Have you ever used Bixby?
