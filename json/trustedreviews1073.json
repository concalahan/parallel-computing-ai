Now we know\nall the games, this miniature console will be the perfect stocking filler for\n1990s gamers.\n\nSet to launch in December and retail for £90/$100, the PlayStation Classic\nwill include some of the system’s best and brightest games. We imagine it will\nbe in very high demand, so get your pre-orders in while you can.\n\nFinal Fantasy 7, Ridge Racer Type 4, Tekken 3 and Wild Arms are just some of\nthe classics to grace the retro console and you can check out the complete\nlist of 20 games below alongside a newly released trailer.\n\n**Pre-order the PlayStation Mini from[Amazon UK](https://amzn.to/2QFyYxv)**\n\nFrom the exterior, it looks exactly like the hardware that launched back in\n1995, albeit in a drastically smaller form factor. The controllers even lack\nanalog sticks like the launch system.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nWith a release date of December 3, 2018, it will include the console itself,\ntwo tiny controllers, an HDMI, and a USB cable.\n\n## PlayStation Classic Games – Here’s the confirmed line-up\n\nSony has confirmed the full selection of games to come as part of the\nPlayStation Classic, and it’s just as good as we’d hoped.
