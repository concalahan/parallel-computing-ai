So how does the new GeForce RTX 2070 stack up\nagainst the older Pascal-based[GTX 1070\nGPU](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-gtx-1070), and\nwhich might be best for you?**\n\nIf you’re all about top-end PC gaming, then Nvidia may have already made your\nweek. Its new RTX range of GPUs aren’t just seriously powered compared with\nthe current GTX 1000-series cards. The [RTX\n2080](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/nvidia-geforce-rtx-2080-specs-\nprice-2952823), 2080i and 2070 can produce some dazzling visuals, to make our\nstress-busting online sessions even more immersive and eye-popping.\n\nThe RTX 2070 may be the entry level RTX 2000-series option and sit beneath its\n2080 brethren, but it’s still an absolute unit, especially when placed side-\nby-side with the current crop of GeForce cards. Here’s how it compares with\nthe still-great-value [GTX\n1070](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-gtx-1070), so you\nknow whether an upgrade is essential when the RTX GPUs hit UK stores.\n\n**Related:[Nvidia RTX 2080](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/nvidia-\nrtx-2080-specs-price-2952823)**\n\n## **Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 vs GTX 1070 – Overview**\n\nThe 1070 launched nearly two years ago and was Nvidia’s flagship mid-range\ncard for 1440p gaming. The 2070 targets the same segment but is reportedly 4K\ncapable as well.\n\nSadly, Nvidia hasn’t given us a set release date for the RTX 2070 just yet.\nHopefully, the wait won’t be too long. An estimated and slightly vague target\nof ‘October 2018’ means this lower-specced card will only be a month or so\nbehind the RTX 2080 and 2080i, which are set to release on September 20th.\n\n![Nvidia RTX 2070 vs GTX\n1070](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\n**Related:[Best GPU](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-graphics-\ncard-3431869)**\n\n## **Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 vs GTX 1070 – Specs**\n\nWhile the GTX 1070 isn’t the top-end current-gen graphics card that Nvidia\noffers, it still packs quite a punch for gaming and media tasks. Based on the\nPascal architecture, this GPU offers a smooth experience at 1440p resolution\nfor all recent titles – although the [GTX 1070\nTi](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-gtx-1070-ti) boasts\na boost in frame rate, if your budget can stretch a little further.\n\nHowever, the GTX 1070 falters when it comes to full 4K gaming. If you’re\nhoping to play at Ultra HD resolution, the RTX 2070 should provide an\nimpressively smooth experience, even at that super-fine detail level. The\nmaximum supported resolution is actually 8K (7680 x 4320), so you’ll be able\nto play on a monitor the size of your wall, with impressively crisp visuals.\n\nThat 16nm Pascal setup allows Nvidia to pack 1920 CUDA cores onto the GTX\n1070. These cores handle most of the grunt work when rendering graphics – so\nmore is definitely a good thing.\n\nIn the RTX 2070, you’ll find 2304 CUDA cores crammed into the improved 12nm\ndesign, for a serious boost in speed. You also get 9 billion transistors,\ncompared with 7.2 billion on the older card.\n\nAs for on-board memory, the 1070 and 2070 both pack 8GB. However, while the\nnew RTX 2070 uses GDDR6 memory, the older GeForce card uses GDDR5. This is\nstill fine for running the latest games, of course; that 256-bit bus offers\n256GB/sec of memory bandwidth, so it’s no slouch. However, the GDDR6 memory is\nfaster and boasts 448GB/sec of memory bandwidth.\n\nThe big new feature that Nvidia is making noise about for its RTX 2000-series\nis ray tracing, something that’s only possible on the new Turing architecture.\n\nRay tracing allows your GPU to produce far more realistic lighting effects,\nrendering environments with startling contrast. The difference is seriously\nimpressive, with the upgrade to real-time shading making a serious impact on\nwhat you see.\n\nThe RTX GPU draws a maximum 175W of power, packing dual-axial 13-blade fans\nand a funky new vapor chamber to keep things cool – and, hopefully, hush-quiet\neven during intensive gaming sessions. By comparison, the GTX 1070 hits a\nmaximum power consumption of 150W – although, again, the effective cooling\nsystem keeps throttling at bay.\n\nIf VR is your thing, then either of these cards will handle the latest such PC\ngames using headsets such as the [Oculus\nRift](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/oculus-rift).\n\n**Related:[Nvidia RTX 2080 vs GTX\n1080](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/nvidia-rtx-2080-vs-\ngtx-1080-3536434)**\n\n## **Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 vs GTX 1070 – Price and early verdict**\n\nThe GeForce RTX 2070 has been announced with a release price of $599 US; we’re\nstill waiting on a UK price. You can expect the great-value GTX 1070 to drop\nin price as soon as the RTX hits, so if you’re tempted by this GPU, we’d\nrecommend holding off a bit longer.\n\n**Excited about the new RTX 2070 or are you planning on snapping up a\ndiscounted 1070?
