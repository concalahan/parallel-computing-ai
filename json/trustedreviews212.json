You weren’t sure what was going on\ndownstairs?”\n\n“Well, it’s going to be Christmas Eve for a while.”\n\nDoes that mean there’ll be a Christmas Day eventually? It certainly sounds\nlike it. Imagine enduring Christmas Eve as a kid with no pay off in the\nmorning!\n\nRecent indications are that an Apple Car won’t be roadworthy until 2019 at the\nearliest, which ties into what Cook is saying.\n\n**Related:[Android Auto vs Apple\nCarPlay](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/apple-carplay-vs-android-\nauto)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThe comments are the boss’s latest acknowledgement of Apple’s interest in the\nauto sector.\n\nIn a Q&A with Fortune last week Cook said [Apple’s mass hiring of auto\nexperts](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/tim-cook-on-apple-car-hiring-\nexperts-doesn-t-mean-we-re-committed), doesn’t necessarily mean the company is\ngoing to offer a car for sale.\n\nCook said: “We don’t have to spend large amounts to explore. So I can’t talk\nabout this certain area that you’re talking about. But when we start spending\nlarge amounts of money, we’re committed at that point. But we explore things\nwith teams of people.”\n\n(apester:56671355b8db3ddc5ef5c366)\n\nAre you looking forward to the Apple car? Let us know in the comments.\n\n"}
