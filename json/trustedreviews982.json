But[CES 2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ces-2018-live-\nnews-highlights-3350586) has shown an increased focus on not only tracking\nyour ZZZs, but also helping to improve your sleep. **\n\nWhen it comes to health and well-being, activity during the day is an\nimportant component of leading a healthier lifestyle. But it’s overnight when\nyour body does its physical and mental recovery, so it’s just as important to\nget a good night’s kip, which should start with one of our [best\nmattresses](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-mattresses-3461169). A\nsolid night of sleep has also been linked with a range of health benefits,\nfrom lower stress levels and improved mental and athletic performance. Those\nwho sleep well also tend to find it easier to lose body fat.\n\nTraipsing the floors of CES, it’s clear that sleep is one of the big focuses\nof fitness tech in the coming year. Here are some of the more interesting\nproducts I’ve seen, from the big players to the plucky upstarts to the plain\nweird.\n\n### Nokia Sleep\n\n![Nokia\nSleep](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nNokia, formerly Withings, has released a new dedicated sleep-tracking sensor,\nwhich is a sort of successor to the Withings Aura. The sensor slips underneath\nyour mattress and detects your movement, while also monitoring for snoring.\nIts design might be preferable for anyone who doesn’t like wearing a device to\nbed, as you won’t notice it’s there.\n\nIt will deliver the usual sleep cycle breakdown of your sleep, as well as\nassigning your night a ‘sleep score’, so you can look at ways to improve your\noverall sleep health. It’s about the quality of sleep, not just the quantity\nafter all.\n\nThe Nokia Sleep will work with the Health Mate app and include a Sleep Smarter\nprogram that claims to help you achieve 12 minutes of extra sleep a night.\nThat may not sound like much, but it can make a difference. The device will\nalso work with IFTTT integration, which opens up some interesting automation.\nYou can use the Sleep to detect when you get into bed to automatically turn\noff lights or adjust your Nest thermostat, for example. The Sleep should be\nout in Q1 this year, and will cost around £100.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\n### Philips SmartSleep\n\n![Philips\nSmartSleep](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nNext up from one of the bigger tech names is the SmartSleep from Philips. This\nsoft headband is designed to be worn while you sleep. It hides away sensors\nthat detect your brain wave activity, so it will know when you’re off in the\nland of nod. When it detects periods of slow-wave sleep, little speakers will\nplay white noise patterns to help you continue sleeping.\n\nThe customised audio tones are meant to enhance the depth and duration of your\nslow-wave sleep. Of course, there’s also a connected app that will log your\nsleep metrics and deliver tips and guidance on how to improve your sleep.\nPhilips says that, after wearing the device for two weeks, 70% of its\nchronically sleep-deprived test subjects said that SmartSleep left them\nfeeling less tired during the day. The SmartSleep will cost $399.99 when it\nlaunches in spring in the US.\n\n**Related:[Best fitness trackers](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nfitness-tracker)**\n\n### Dreem\n\n![Dreem](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe Dreem, from a French startup, takes a similar approach to the SmartSleep\nin the sense that it’s a headband you wear overnight. It has a pulse oxymeter\nfor detecting your heart rate and respiration, as well as bone-conducting\nspeakers for delivering its audio, and an accelerometer for detecting movement\nin the part that goes over your skull. Dedicated sensors are also monitoring\nbrain waves.\n\nDreem says the device will also help you to fall asleep faster through its\nsound-based programs that are inspired by meditation, cognitive training and\nbio-feedback. Once you’re down and out, it will use its audio to keep you\nsleeping. The addition of that pulse oxymeter could mean it can track and\ncorrelate more data than the SmartSleep, but the overall concept is very\nsimilar. The inclusion of that extra sensor could go some way to justify the\nextra cost at $499.99.\n\n**Related:[Best heart rate\nmonitors](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-heart-rate-monitor)**\n\n### Nightingale\n\n![Nightingale](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe Nightingale takes an interesting approach in that it doesn’t even have to\nbe close to your bed. It’s a device that plugs into one of your wall sockets\nand uses sound-masking technology to reduce ambient sounds that will keep you\nawake at night. Potentially great for anyone who lives near a busy road or\nnoisy neighbours.\n\nA representative told me that the technology isn’t exactly like the active\nnoise cancelling you’ll find in headphones, in that there’s no microphone\ndetecting the external sound. Instead, the Nightingale emits ‘personalised\nsound blankets’ tailored to the room acoustics and sleep conditions. All this\nis managed from your smartphone.\n\nSupposedly, these sound blankets are acoustically tuned to reduce the signal-\nto-noise ratio of outside noise, masking the ones that would otherwise wake\nyou up. How well this actually works would require some testing. The\nNightingale is available in a single pack that should support bedrooms up to\n150 sq ft for $149 or a twin pack for larger rooms.\n\n### ReNu by NuCalm\n\n![Remu](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe NuCalm stand at CES was promising that “20 minutes of relaxation is\nequivalent to 2 hours sleep”, so little wonder there was a long queue to try\nit out. The ReNu is a more portable version of the NuCalm approach to\nrelaxation. What is NuCalm, you ask? According to the website, it “uses\nbiochemistry, physics, and neurophysiology to rapidly and reliably create deep\nrelaxation so you can feel better, perform better, and live better.”\n\nIt uses a combination of a topical cream or chewable supplements that\ncounteract adrenaline. A NuCalm rep told me the cream I rubbed into my neck\nuses natural amino acids (admittedly, I’m not sure what that really means).\nNext up is micro-current stimulation to help the NuCalm supplementation. This\nsupposedly reduces the body’s stress response. Finally, neuroacoustic software\nplays audio to help you to relax. You do all this while wearing an eye mask to\nblock out visual stimuli.\n\nWhile I didn’t get to try out the ReNu wearable, I did try the standard NuCalm\nprocess. The whole experience is a little like one of those flotation tanks\nyou might have seen in an episode of _The Simpsons_ or the film _Altered\nStates_. The 20 minutes flew by, and by the end I did feel slightly more\nrelaxed – although, admittedly, it might have just been nice to get off my\nfeet having been walking across the show floor all day.\n\n### Other notable mentions…\n\n![Sleep\nNumber](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThere were plenty of ‘smart pillows’, such as the **Zeeq** that can track\nsleep, detect snoring and play music. Then there are the **SleepPhones** ,\nwhich are headphones that sit in a headband that you can wear to bed. The\n**Sleep Number** is a bed you can adjust in every possible way imaginable.\nSensors inside can detect how well you sleep and adjust its firmness and angle\nto your sleeping. I had a lie on it, and it definitely felt comfortable.\n\n**What do you make of the sleep technology on show at CES? Let us know on\nFacebook or Twitter.**\n\n"}
