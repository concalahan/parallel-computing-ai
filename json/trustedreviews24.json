What you buy is what you\nget, whether it’s individual items or the seasonal Battle Pass.\n\nLoot boxes, randomised packages filled with cosmetic items, are available in\ngames like [Overwatch](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/overwatch) and\n[PUBG](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/playerunknowns-battlegrounds) in\na range of different quantities, although Fortnite has no such thing.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![fortnite](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### The Church of England has accused Fortnite of “dubious morality” that\nencourages children to gamble\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/gaming/church-england-accused-fortnite-\ndubious-morality-encourages-children-gamble-3612258 \"The Church of England has\naccused Fortnite of “dubious morality” that encourages children to gamble\")\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Ishan Agarwal via Twitter \n\n### OnePlus 6T Launch LIVE: Updates and all the latest news from New York\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/oneplus-6t-release-date-3525032 \"OnePlus\n6T Launch LIVE: Updates and all the latest news from New York\")\n\n  *   * [ ![BEST NOW TV DEALS](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Best Now TV Deals: Save on subscriptions and streaming boxes\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/black-friday-now-tv-deals-3333988 \"Best\nNow TV Deals: Save on subscriptions and streaming boxes\")\n\n  * \n\nSpeaking to [The Daily\nTelegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/10/28/church-england-has-\naccused-makers-games-fortnite-dubious-morality/), Dr Smith said, “Parents\nshould be very careful in letting their children play any of these games that\nappear to be designed to encourage gambling later in life.”\n\n**Related:**[ **Best Battle Royale\nGames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/battle-royale-games-3471487)\n\nThere’s definitely a debate to be had regarding loot boxes in gaming and their\ninfluence on children, but The Church of England accusing Fortnite, which\ndoesn’t have them, is a bad place to start.\n\nThe conflation of video games with genuinely damaging gambling addictions is\nalso a dangerous line of debate to cross, particularly when children often\nneed the consent of parents to make in-game purchases.\n\n**Do you think Fortnite is a danger to younger gamers when it comes to\ngambling?
