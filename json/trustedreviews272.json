That\ndidn’t take the shine off of Google’s official Android O reveal, though – now\nthat final details of the Android 8 update have been confirmed, there’s more\nreason to be excited than ever.\n\n**[Should you buy the Samsung Galaxy Note 8? Read our hands-on\nreview](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-8)**\n\nHere are some of the key features you should look forward to from Android Oreo\nwhen it rolls out to your smartphone.\n\n**Related:[How to download Android Oreo\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/android-o-release-date-name-download-\ndevices-2949920)**\n\n## 1\\. Background limits\n\nBattery life is always a big concern, which is why Google often makes\nimprovements with new iterations of Android.\n\nThe latest version of Android Oreo is no different, with Google increasing the\nautomatic limits on what apps can do in the background in a number of key\nareas (broadcasts, background services, and location updates, for instance).\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n“These changes will make it easier to create apps that have minimal impact on\na user’s device and battery. Background limits represent a significant change\nin Android, so we want every developer to get familiar with them,” reads a\nGoogle blog post.\n\n## 2\\. Picture-in-picture\n\nGoogle is also expected to introduce new picture-in-picture functionality,\nwhich is probably one of the most useful changes incoming.\n\nThis feature would allow users to continue watching videos on a small virtual\nscreen while getting stuff done within other apps. Google also says that apps\nwill be able to put themselves in picture-in-picture mode.\n\nThe idea is that you can watch a YouTube video while sending e-mails in the\nGmail app – who says work can’t be fun, eh?\n\n**Related:[Best Android phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-android-\nphones-1_round-up)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: Google\n\n## 3\\. Notification channels and dots\n\nGoogle also plans to group notifications into channels, giving users greater\ncontrol over their app notification categories.\n\nExplaining the move, Google writes: “Users can block or change the behaviour\nof each channel individually, rather than managing all of the apps’\nnotifications together.”\n\nGoogle is also making it possible to snooze individual notifications, which is\nseriously useful given the persistence of some Android system notifications.\nYou’ll be able to snooze notifications for 15 minutes, 30 minutes, or one\nwhole hour.\n\nAnother new feature will be notification dots, which are visual indicators on\napp icons that’ll show if you have any waiting notifications. This is a\nfeature that iPhone users will be familiar with, as it’s been part of Apple’s\niOS software for years.\n\n## 4\\. Autofill APIs\n\nGoogle is also hoping to save you some time, courtesy of Autofill APIs. This\nwill allow your favourite password manager apps to work with the Android\noperating system, so you can access them just like you would a third-party\nkeyboard.\n\nGoogle explains: “Android users already depend on a range of password managers\nto auto-fill login details and repetitive information, which makes setting up\nnew apps or placing transactions easier. Now we’re making this work more\neasily available across the ecosystem by adding platform support for auto-\nfill.”\n\n## 5\\. Adaptive icons\n\nAnother expected feature is the addition of adaptive icons. This means\ndevelopers will be able to use different-shaped app icons, depending on the\nmanufacturer’s preference.\n\nApp icons will also support badge notifications, as previously mentioned.\n\n**Related:[Best smartphone](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nsmartphone)**\n\n## 6\\. Better keyboard navigation\n\nAnother big change is the improvement of keyboard navigation. According to\nGoogle, more users are navigating to apps using a physical keyboard thanks to\nthe arrival of the Play Store on the Google Chrome OS.\n\n“In Android O, we are focused on building a more reliable, predictable model\nfor ‘arrow’ and ‘tab’ navigation that aids both developers and end users,”\nsays Google.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: Google\n\n## 7\\. Wide colour gamut in imaging apps\n\nSmartphone displays are constantly improving, and OLED panels are more\nabundant than ever – but software support needs to be available too.\n\nFortunately, Google promises that the makers of imaging apps will now be able\nto make better use of high-end displays, especially with handsets that feature\npanels capable of supporting a wide colour gamut.\n\n“To display wide gamut images, apps will need to enable a flag in their\nmanifest (per activity) and load bitmaps with an embedded wide colour profile\n(Adobe RGB, Pro Photo RGB, DCI-P3, and so on,” Google advises developers.\n\n## 8\\. Better audio\n\nGoogle is also set to add Sony’s LDAC codec, which has been donated to Android\nby the Japanese tech giant. This should improve upon the Bluetooth A2DP\nprotocol currently used today.\n\nThe company is also introducing AAudio, which should result in improved low-\nlatency audio. The firm says that it’s a “New native API that’s designed\nspecifically for apps that require high-performance, low-latency audio”.\n\n## 9\\. Camera app improvements\n\nGoogle is spending some time reworking the camera app, offering a new double-\ntap feature that lets you quickly get to 50% zoom.\n\nThere’s also a new dedicated button that lets you switch between photo and\nvideo modes; previously, users were forced to swipe, which some may have found\nunintuitive.\n\n**Related:[Best Android apps](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nandroid-apps)**\n\n**Are you looking forward to using Android Oreo?
