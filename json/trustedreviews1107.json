OnLeaks is generally considered to be relatively reliable when it\ncomes to leaking accurate smartphone renders and specifications.\n\n> And now, ur very 1st look at\n[#HuaweiMate10](https://twitter.com/hashtag/HuaweiMate10?src=hash) (360 video\n+ dimensions based upon factory CAD) on behalf of\n[@compareraja](https://twitter.com/compareraja) <https://t.co/SncijNHZah>\n[pic.twitter.com/EfEVmPHkzQ](https://t.co/EfEVmPHkzQ)\n\n>\n\n> — Steve H. (@OnLeaks) [September 6,\n2017](https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/905248602100027392)\n\nBased on the renders, not a lot appears to have changed from the [Huawei Mate\n9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/huawei-mate-9) other than the\npositioning of the fingerprint scanner on the front of the phone rather than\nthe rear. A dual lens rear camera array is present and correct, likely\nsporting Leica tech, like its predecessor and the [Huawei\nP10](https://www.trustedreviews.com/g00/reviews/huawei-p10?i10c.referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.co.uk%2F).\nAnd the Mate 10 will retain a 3.5mm audio jack, while charging and data\ntransfer will be done through a USB Type-C port.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe display is set to measure in at 5.9 inches and the handset’s chassis is\nexpected to have an all glass back, which will likely give it a premium feel\nbut also make it a fingerprint magnet. With the addition of a physical front-\nmounted home button, the Mate 10 could stretch to rather large dimensions,\npotentially making it a phone that shuns single handed operation.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nOther specifications are open to further speculation, but it would be a safe\nbet to predict the Mate 10 will have Huawei’s latest Kirin 970 system-on-a-\nchip at its heart paired with 6GB of RAM and on board storage starting at\n64GB; the renders suggest that there’s no microSD slot to allow for more\nstorage space to be added.\n\nThe [Huawei Mate 10 is set to be officially revealed on October\n16](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/huawei-mate-10-3260270) in Munich,\nGermany.\n\n**Related:[Samsung Galaxy Note 8 review\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-8)**\n\n**What would you like to see from the Mate 10? let us know on Facebook or\ntweet @TrustedReviews.**\n\n"}
