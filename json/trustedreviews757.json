At the LG Science Park in Seoul, South Korea, _Trusted Reviews_ got a\nchance to get up-close and personal with the latest incarnations of CLOi.**\n\nAfter coming across a little shy at the [CES 2018 LG press\nconference](https://www.trustedreviews.com/?p=3367907), the CLOi personal\nassistant was in a far better mood this time around. Effectively a smart\nspeaker with a cute face, this CLOi is an attempt to make robots that bit more\nendearing. Largely, it works.\n\nPat CLOi on the head and she gets all happy and hunkers down; tap her on the\nface and she gets annoyed and spins around to stare at you. That’s a level of\ninteraction that you don’t get from an [Amazon\nEcho](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/amazon-echo).\n\nMore practically, CLOi can follow the sound of your voice, turning to look at\nyou as you ask her things. That makes interactions more personal, and it feels\nlike you’re talking to someone, rather than throwing around commands\naimlessly.\n\nCurrently, CLOi is powered by Clova, a South Korean-developed personal\nassistant. She has all of the features you’d expect, and can give you\ninformation or even sing you a song. LG told us that it’s currently working\nwith both Google and Amazon, so we could eventually see a CLOi in the UK\npowered by Alexa or the Google Assistant. No official launch information has\nyet been released.\n\n![LG CLOi personal\nassistant](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\n**Related:[Amazon Alexa guide](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/amazon-\nalexa-guide-3462356)**\n\nThe other robots in the CLOi line-up are of a more practical, industrial\npurpose. The GuideBot, which is working at Seoul’s Incheon airport, can help\ndirect people to where they need to go, navigating itself and prompting you to\nfollow.\n\nIts companion at Incheon airport is CleanBot, a kind of super-charged robot\nvacuum cleaner that merrily makes its way around, keeping everything clean. It\neven speaks, asking you to move, as it’s currently cleaning.\n\n![LG CLOi\nCleanBot](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nBuilt along similar lines are the ServeBot, PorterBot and CartBot. These are,\nrespectively, designed to bring food and drink, carry your luggage, and help\nwith your shopping at the supermarket. And they’ll be rolled out in South\nKorea soon.\n\n![LG CLOi\nPorterBot](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nWhat’s striking about these industrial robots is that they’re designed for\nvery specific purposes and are functional and utilitarian, rather than being\noverly clever and human-like, such as the Honda Asimo.\n\nThey’re too big to have in our homes, but in larger spaces (shopping centres,\nhotels and airports), they fit in perfectly. Really, these robots are the\nfirst steps (or rolls, in this case) into the future.\n\n**How do you feel about robots? Would you like on in your home?
