Here’s everything you need to\nknow about the Snapdragon 835, including benchmark results, new features and\nwhere you’ll find it this year.**\n\n## What is the Snapdragon 835?\n\nThe 835 is Qualcomm’s mobile system on a chip (SoC), which contains all the\nkey ingredients that sit at the heart of a smartphone. This includes the CPU,\ngraphics processor, Wi-Fi and 4G modems, sound hardware and sensor hubs, among\nothers.\n\nIt’s the successor to the Snapdragon 821, which launched last year as a minor\nimprovement to the 820. Found in many of last year’s top-end phones, including\nthe [Samsung Galaxy S7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-s7-edge-\nreview \"Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge\"), [OnePlus\n3T](https://www.trustedreviews.com/oneplus-3t-review \"OnePlus 3T review\") and\n[HTC 10](https://www.trustedreviews.com/htc-10-review \"HTC 10 review\"), this\nwas the pinnacle of Android smartphone chipsets in 2016.\n\nBut now there’s a new king. On paper, the Snapdragon 835 offers significant\ndifferences over the 821. Physically, it’s much smaller, which is a result of\nthe push into a 10nm (nanometre) production process from the 821’s 14nm\nprocess.\n\n**Related:[Best smartphones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-\nsmartphone_round-up \"Best smartphones\")  \n**  \nThis sounds complicated, but in simple terms the reduction in process size\nmeans the chip’s transistors – the yes/no gates that do all the work – can be\npacked much closer together. This can lead to more efficient running, which in\nturn results in lower power consumption, less heat and better performance\nacross the board.\n\n![Snapdragon 835\n1](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)_Left: Qualcomm Snapdragon 835, Right: Snapdragon 821_  \n  \nThe reduction in the size of the chip also means greater flexibility for\nsmartphone manufacturers to add slightly larger batteries or make slightly\nthinner phones, for example.\n\n## Snapdragon 835 phones\n\nThere’s only one phone we officially know will carry the Snapdragon 835, but\nwe’ll make some educated guesses for the rest of the pack:\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\n  * [Sony Xperia XZ Premium](https://www.trustedreviews.com/sony-xperia-xz-premium-review \"Sony Xperia XZ premium\")\n  * [HTC 11 (unannounced)](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/htc-11-release-date-specs-2017-price-uk-news-rumours \"HTC 11\")\n  * [Galaxy S8 (unannounced)](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s8-release-date-specs-rumours-price-uk \"Galaxy S8\")\n  * [OnePlus 4/5 (unannounced)](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/oneplus-4-release-date-specs-rumours-price-uk-pictures \"OnePlus 4\")\n  * [Pixel 2 (unannounced)](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-pixel-2-release-date-specs-rumours-price-uk-xl \"Pixel 2\")\n  * LG V30 (unannounced)\n\n##  Snapdragon 835 – The features you care about\n\n**Battery Life** : Qualcomm says that, on average, the 835 will use around 25%\nless power, which will lead to a direct increase to battery life. Of course,\nthis relies on phone makers actually using decent-capacity cells in their\nhandsets instead of choosing slimmer designs with lower capacities.\n\nIn some tasks, such as recording high-resolution video and rendering 3D games,\nthe 835 is up to 30% more efficient.\n\n**QuickCharge 4** : This one’s a biggie. If you thought QuickCharge 3 was\nspeedy, QuickCharge 4 is… well… quicker. Up to 25% faster while managing 30%\nbetter efficiency; so that extra speed won’t result in added heat. This is\ngood news for those of us who charge their phones in the vicinity of pillows,\nwith complete disregard for battery safety.  \n**  \nBetter Performance** : The Snapdragon 835 uses an updated version of\nQualcomm’s Kryo CPU, known as the 280. The CPU has eight cores and is based on\nARM’s “big.LITTLE” design. Factory fresh, the four “big” cores run at 2.45GHz\nfor snappy performance, while the four “little” cores run at 1.9GHz for those\nbackground tasks that don’t require huge power.\n\nSmartphone manufacturers have the final say when it comes to how the cores are\nactually utilised, which is why you’ll see a range of benchmark scores from\neach phone that uses the Kryo 280 CPU.\n\nThe Adreno 540 is said to be 25% more powerful than its predecessor in 3D\nperformance, so your games will run faster. It also supports 4K UHD Premium\nand HDR10 video (read more in our guide to HDR) and 10-bit colour displays\n(that’s 1.07bn colours versus 16.8 million on 8-bit screens).  \n_  \nScroll down to our benchmarks section for an in-depth look at performance._\n\n**Faster Wireless** : The Snapdragon 835 features a modem that supports “X16\nLTE” speeds, which equates to an absolute maximum 1-gigabit 4G connection.\nYou’ll rarely find that sort of speed anywhere in the world, but that improved\nmodem will also help with more reliable and efficient connections on slower 4G\nnetworks.\n\nOptional 802.11ad Wi-Fi is present, too, which is a new, ultra-fast\n(4.6-gigabit) standard for ultra-short-range data transfers. It hasn’t really\nfound widespread support anywhere yet, but there are potential uses for\ntransferring huge media files to your phone without having to plug it into\nyour PC.\n\n![Snapdragon 835\n2](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)_Snapdragon 835 will offer… elevated performance_\n\n**Related:[Best budget phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-cheap-\nmobile-phones_round-up \"Best budget phones\")**\n\nFinally, the 835 supports Bluetooth 5 – the faster, more reliable and longer-\nrange wireless standard. There aren’t any consumer products available to\nconnect to just yet, but rest assured that when they do appear, you’ll be\nhappy you have Bluetooth 5 on board.\n\n**Camera** : The 835 now supports Qualcomm’s EIS (electronic image\nstablisation) 3.0 tech, for shake-free video. It uses a new algorithm that\nbetter understands how the phone is moving and corrects the image quickly.\nThis feature was previously exclusive to the LG V20, but with the Snapdragon\n835, any smartphone maker can take advantage of it.\n\n**![cheese\n29](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)**_The 821-powered LG G6 was the first smartphone to\nfeature Qualcomm’s latest camera tech, a feature that’s been carried over to\nthe 835 ****_\n\nSimilarly, the 835 now has built-in dual-camera support. This allows it to\nhandle two 16-megapixel sensors at the concurrently, meaning you can zoom in\nseamlessly as you can on the [LG\nG6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/lg-g6-review \"LG G6 review\"), which had the\nsame technology built into its 821 chip. Hopefully, this will make quality\ndual-camera smartphones more common.\n\n**Security** : Qualcomm has combined its various security bits and bobs into a\nsingle brand, called Qualcomm Haven. This bolsters security in various ways,\nincluding keeping track of suspicious app behaviour (even if you ignore all\nthe permissions warnings your phone throws at you) and locking them down\nbefore they do any harm. This relies upon smartphone makers and app developers\nworking with Haven, so having an 835 phone doesn’t guarantee you better\nsecurity.\n\nHaven also includes Qualcomm’s iris-recognition algorithms that were\npreviously exclusive to the Samsung Galaxy Note 7. Again, an 835-powered phone\nwill require an infra-red camera to take advantage, but the internal hardware\nand software is all sorted at least.\n\nWe should note here that we weren’t blown away by the iris scanner in the\nGalaxy Note 7, although that was more a result of its reliance on you lifting\nthe phone to eye level in order to have to unlock it. It is, however, much\nmore secure than a fingerprint scanner – although any phone that adopts the\niris-scanning tech is likely to use a fingerprint scanner as well. More choice\nis better, right?\n\n**Audio** : The 835 now supports 32-bit, 384KHz audio DACs (digital-to-\nanalogue converters), if your smartphone maker of choice decides to include\none. We were huge fans of the high-end DAC in the 820-powered HTC 10, so let’s\nhope whatever phone HTC makes with the 835 takes advantage of this even-better\naudio quality.\n\n## Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 – Benchmark results versus 821, Apple A10, Exynos\n8890 and Kirin 960\n\nNow for the bit you were waiting for. Qualcomm has given us early access to\nnon-production smartphones running the 835 to see how it performs in our key\nbenchmarks. To make things fair and interesting, we’ve also re-run the same\nbenchmarks – updated to the latest versions – on last year’s key smartphone\nCPUs.\n\n![snapdragon\n5](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\n**The contenders**\n\n  * Prototype Snapdragon 835 (6GB of RAM)\n  * [Google Pixel XL (Qualcomm Snapdragon 821, 4GB of RAM)](https://www.trustedreviews.com/google-pixel-xl-review \"Pixel XL review\")\n  * [Galaxy S7 Edge (Samsung Exynos 8890, 4GB of RAM)](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-s7-edge-review \"Galaxy S7 Edge\")\n  * [Huawei P10 Plus (HiSilicon Kirin 960, 6GB of RAM)](https://www.trustedreviews.com/huawei-p10-plus-review \"Huawei P10 Plus\")\n  * [iPhone 7 Plus (Apple A10 Fusion, 3GB of RAM)](https://www.trustedreviews.com/iphone-7-plus-review \"iPhone 7 Plus review\")\n\nFirst, the AnTuTu benchmark. This test runs through lots of different tests\nincluding 3D work and processor-intensive tasks, and spits out an overall\nscore. It’s a heavy-handed way of measuring a phone’s overall performance, as\na high or low score in one area can upset the overall result.![Snapdragon 835\nbenchmarks\n1](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nIn the pecking order, the 835 acquitted itself as the fastest Android by quite\nsome margin, more than 35,000 points ahead of the Kirin-powered Huawei P10\nPlus. It was slower than the iPhone 7 Plus, although comparing benchmarks on\ndifferent operating systems is rather hazardous since the two work completely\ndifferently.![Snapdragon 835\nbenchmarks](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nProbably the most interesting score on the AnTuTu benchmark is the 3D graphics\nscore. This demonstrates how well the chip will perform in high-end gaming\ntasks. The 835’s Adreno GPU put in a pretty amazing score of 75,647, eclipsing\nthe Snapdragon 821, Exynos 8890 and Kirin 960. Even the iPhone 7 Plus, long\nconsidered the best phone for gaming, was put into the shade.\n\nOf course, are there any games that will take advantage of this blazing speed?\nProbably not right now, so the benefits are a bit moot, to be frank. But, as\nis always the case with gaming, investing in the future is never a bad thing.\n\nFinally, we look at Geekbench 4. This test covers single-core performance\n(good for knowing how fast a phone will feel in everyday tasks) and multi-core\nperformance (video and photo editing).  \n![Snapdragon 835\nbenchmarks](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSingle-core is much more important for most tasks, and the 835 does a decent\njob here, just eeking out the Kirin 960. However, it’s still well behind the\nking of single-core computing, the Apple A10 Fusion. There are lots of reasons\nfor this beyond the capabilities of the CPU. Apple uses high-end components\nthat most other Android phones don’t, including incredibly fast memory that\ndirectly helps single-core performance. Plus, iOS is more tightly integrated\nwith the iPhone’s hardware. That’s why iPhones always feel so snappy.\n\nThe 835 did well in the multi-core tests, a little ahead of the Kirin 960 and\na decent chunk ahead of the A10 Fusion.\n\n## Performance conclusions\n\nThe 835 is clearly a handy performer, but it faces stiff competition from\nHiSilicon’s Kirin 960 and, as ever, Apple’s A10 Fusion. Not surprisingly, it\nobliterates previous-gen kit from Samsung, but we’ve yet to see what sort of\nperformance the new Samsung Exynos 8895 will be capable of.\n\nGiven the Exynos is built on the same 10nm process and is based on ARM\ndesigns, we’d expect the two processors to perform similarly.\n\nThere are plenty of unknowns right now. The lower power consumption figures\nand faster charging are as-yet untested by us, and beyond raw performance,\nwill be key when it comes to making a buying decision.\n\n**Related:[Samsung Galaxy S8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-\ngalaxy-s8-release-date-specs-rumours-price-uk)**\n\n**What do you think of our benchmarks?
