Here’s\neverything you need to know including release dates, model numbers, specs, and\nsupport for different HDR and audio formats.  \n**  \nPhilips does things in its own time. While its Japanese and Korean rivals\ntypically unveil their products at the start the year, Philips has only just\nannounced its lineup of 2018 TVs at a European launch event in Amsterdam.\n\nEven then, it’s revealed only part of its range for the year. Further products\nwill be introduced to the market around September, at IFA in Berlin.\nNevertheless, there are a number of worthwhile products in this first round,\nincluding a new headline 4K OLED model.\n\nI’ll go through all the model numbers below, but first here are a few things\nyou should know about the Philips 2018 range.\n\n**Related:[Samsung’s Crazy Plan to Beat OLED in 2018: QLED, Micro Full Array\nand modular Micro LED](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/new-\nsamsung-2018-tv-models-qled-specs-price-release-date-3367473)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n## Philips TVs 2018 – 5 key facts\n\n**1)** Philips continues to rely on **Ambilight** , its proprietary technology\nthat uses rows of LEDs behind the screen to light up your wall. The idea is to\nblast out colours to match the picture on-screen, creating the impression of a\nbigger image. Philips has included this party trick in its models for about 10\nyears now, and it will feature in most models in the new range too.\n\n**2)** The firm is focusing heavily on aesthetics, with much talk about\n**“European design”**. This basically translates to a more luxurious look for\nthe higher end of its range, combined with a minimalist aesthetic to fit in\nwith style-conscious households. The Philips 973, for example, combines metal\nwith high-quality Danish fabric.\n\n**3)** Inclusion of the excellent processor from last year – the **P5 –**\nremains. The “P” stands for “perfect,” while the 5 refers to the five areas of\nfocus: source quality, sharpness, colour, contrast and motion. It’s a single-\nchip processing system designed to provide the appropriate processing at the\nright moment. This processor is used in the top models, going down to the 7000\nseries.\n\n**4)** The **OLED** range is being expanded. Last year there was a single\nmodel, but 2018 will have three. Below those models sit the LCD alternatives.\n\n**5)** All 4K/HDR models will be compatible with **HDR10 and HLG** ([Hybrid\nLog-Gamma](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/hybrid-log-gamma-what-is-\nit)). Currently, Philips isn’t interested in [Dolby\nVision](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/should-you-next-tv-have-dolby-\nvision).\n\nNow for that list of model numbers. Read on to discover the differences\nbetween the models listed.\n\n**Related:[Best 4K TVs](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-4k-tvs_round-up)**\n\n## Philips TVs 2018\n\n  * OLED973 (65 inches)\n  * OLED873 (65 inches) / POS9002 (55 inches)\n  * OLED803 (55 and 65 inches)\n  * 8503 (49, 55 and 65 inches)\n  * 8303 (49, 55, 65 and 75 inches)\n  * 7803 (49, 55, 65 and 75 inches)\n  * 7303 (43, 50 and 55 inches)\n  * 6503 (43, 50, 55 and 65 inches)\n\n**Related:[Best TVs 2018: 8 amazing TVs you can buy right\nnow](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-tv)**\n\n![Philips\nOLED803](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nPhilips OLED803\n\n## Philips OLED\n\nThere are three lines of OLED TV this year. The top two aren’t exactly new –\nthe OLED973 was unveiled at IFA 2017, but it’s now been renamed. Read our\nfirst impressions from the time it was called the [Philips\n9603](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/philips-9603-oled-tv-hands-on).\n\nThe 55-inch [Philips\n9002](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/philips-55pos9002) from 2017 will\ncontinue to be sold, and is now available in 65 inches. That larger model is\ninexplicably now called the Philips OLED873.\n\nThe [Philips OLED803](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/new-philips-oled-\ntvs-3382662) is brand new, and is the entry-level model in Philips’ high-end\noffering. It presents the same excellent performance as the two top models,\nbut sports a minimalist, monolithic design that’s pretty much all-screen.\nPlus, there are three subwoofers round the back.\n\nAll three models can reach a peak brightness of 900 nits, with a 200Hz frame\nrate. They all support the HDR10+ flavour of high dynamic range.\n\nThat’s it for the first half of 2018, although note that Philips has a\ntendency to save its best for the end of the year. The company showed me a\nprototype successor to the excellent P5 processor, which managed to make an\nolder Philips 901 look better than the more recent 9002.\n\nIf I were to speculate, I’d say that we might see that processor in a new OLED\ncalled OLED903 later in the year, probably at IFA 2018 in September.\n\n**Related:[Panasonic FZ950 and FZ800 4K OLED TVs\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/panasonic-fz950-fz800-4k-oled-tvs-\nclosest-thing-hollywood-home-3367156)**\n\n![Philips 8000\nseries](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nPhilips 8000 series\n\n## Philips 8000 series\n\nEvery range below the OLED family of TVs are LED LCD models.\n\nThe 8503 and 8303 use nano-cell technology, which is supposed to offer a wider\ncolour gamut than quantum dot. Philips says these TVs will cover 90% of\nDCI-P3.\n\nThis is an edge-lit LCD with a peak brightness of 400 nits, but it shares the\n200Hz frame rate, motion processing and HDR10+ support of the OLED models.\n\n![Philips 7000\nseries](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nPhilips 7000 series\n\n## Philips 7000 series\n\nLike the 8000 series above it, the 7000 series uses edge-lit LCD panels with a\npeak brightness of 400 nits. Frame rate drops to 100Hz, there’s no nano-cell\ntechnology, and DCI-P3 coverage goes down to 75%.\n\n## Philips 6000 series\n\nThe 6503 is the entry-level model of 2018, and it doesn’t benefit from the P5\nprocessor. Peak brightness also goes down to 350 nits. But in a surprise move,\nPhilips has seen fit to make this a direct-lit model – which means it might\noffer better lighting uniformity than the 7000 and 8000 series above it.\n\nThat’s everything Philips has confirmed so far. I’m told there are more models\nto come, and I’ll be updating this page as soon as I learn more. Until then,\nhere are the 2017 models, many of which are still available in 2018.\n\n## _Philips TVs 2017_\n\n  * _9002 OLED (55 inches)_\n  * _901F OLED (55 inches) – existing model, continues in 2017_\n  * _7502 (49, 55 and 65 inches)_\n  * _6482 (49 and 55 inches)_\n  * _6412 (43, 49, 55 and 65 inches)_\n  * _6262 (43, 49 and 55 inches)_\n  * _6162 (43, 49, 55 and 65 inches)_\n  * _6402 (32 inches)_\n  * _5231 (24 inches) – existing model, continues in 2017_\n  * _4132 (32 and 43 inches)_\n  * _4112 (32 inches HD ready, 43 inches Full HD)_\n  * _4012 (32 inches HD ready, 43 inches Full HD)_\n  * _4032 (24 and 32 inches)_\n  * _4022 (22 and 24 inches)_\n\n**Related:[Philips 55POS901F/12\nreview](https://www.trustedreviews.com/philips-55pos901f-oled-tv-review)**\n\n**What do you think of the 2018 Philips TVs so far?
