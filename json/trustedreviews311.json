Join us as we take you through the edited highlights.**\n\n## Asus Mixed Reality Headset\n\nJoining Dell, Acer and Lenovo in bringing a Windows Mixed reality headset to\nmarket, Asus has launched its own. The company has sung the virtues of its\nlight, 400g design, anti-bacterial properties and inside-out space-sensing\ntechnology. With the same screen specifications as the other Windows Mixed\nReality headsets that have already been launched, Asus is clearly trying to\ndifferentiate itself from the competition.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nPriced at €449 (probably £449/$449) with controllers, the Asus Mixed Reality\nHeadset will fit alongside the Dell model announced yesterday.\n\n## Asus ZenBook Flip S 14 and 15\n\nThis pair of new ZenBook Flip devices slot in underneath the previously-\nannounced Asus ZenBook Flip S. The 14-inch model (UX461) comes with the latest\n8th-generation Intel Core processors (up to Core i7), Nvidia’s latest low-end\nGeForce MX150 graphics and a 14-inch narrow-bezel display.\n\nAsus claims up to 13 hours of battery life, with this 2-in-1 weighing in at\n1.4kg. Pricing starts at €799 (probably £799 and $799), and availability has\nnot yet been announced.\n\n**Related:[Best laptops for\nstudents](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-laptops-for-students)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe 15-inch model (UX561) gets a similar set of specifications, but uprated\nGTX 1050 graphics from Nvidia instead, making it a potential rival to the non-\nflippable [Dell XPS 15](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/dell-xps-15).\nPricing starts at €899 (probably £899 and $899), and there’s no release date\nyet.\n\nThe ZenBook FLip S doesn’t have a price or release date yet, but has been\nupdated from 7th-gen to 8th-gen Intel chips.\n\n## Asus ZenBook 13 (UX331) and VivoBook S14\n\nThe ZenBook UX331 is the followup to the UX330, and comes in lighter (1.12kg)\nand slightly thicker (13.9mm) than the previous model.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThis Ultrabook will gain Nvidia’s GeForce MX150 graphics, a 4K display with\nnarrow beezels and, as is now customary, 8th-generation Intel chips. No price\nand release date for the time being.\n\nThe mid-range VivoBook S14 ( _pictured_ ), meanwhile, is a similar piece of\nkit, but coming with a 14-inch screen instead the 13-inch model on the ZenBook\n13.\n\n**What do you make of Asus’ IFA 2017 announcements?
