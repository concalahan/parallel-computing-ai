One of the most\nintriguing of these, though, was Sony’s second range of OLED TVs, the AF8\nseries. TV expert and _Trusted Reviews_ contributor John Archer sees how it\nstacks up against last year’s effort, the Sony A1 OLED.**\n\nIt turns out that the AF8s are actually pretty similar to Sony’s ground-\nbreaking A1 OLED debutantes. There are, however, some differences – if you\nknow where to look.\n\nThe first thing you notice is that while the AF8 retains the same extremely\nthin, speaker-less frame around its screen that you get with the A1, it stands\nbolt upright, rather than leaning back slightly like the A1s do.\n\nWhile I personally didn’t have a problem with the slight angle of the A1, I\nknow many other potential buyers did. So it’s sensible – and in keeping with\nthe brand’s regularly professed desire to offer products to suit as wide a\ndemographic as possible – that Sony has now introduced a more straightforward\nvertical design.\n\nMaking the screen vertical has meant doing away with the A1’s angled support\nleg. Instead, the AF8 sits extremely low – as in, its frame almost rests on\nyour furniture – on a new, centrally mounted metal desktopfoot.\n\nThis is nicely made, though the main thing about it is that you can barely see\nit when you’re sat down to watch the set. Add to this some clever cable\nmanagement, and the AF8 continues the theme established with the A1 of\npresenting you with ‘just a picture’ to watch, so you can become fully\nimmersed in the on-screen action.\n\nThe AF8 is able to exist within such a minimal chassis because it joins the A1\nmodels in using acoustic screen technology to produce its sound. This vibrates\nthe screen to deliver a stereo surround effect and is one of most innovative\nintegrated TV audio technologies we’ve seen in the last couple of years.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n**Related:[Sony A1 OLED\nreview](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sony-a1-oled)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSince the A1 features a bass speaker in its angled support leg, I’d expected\nthe AF8 to offer a reduced audio performance. However, Sony assures me that\nthe sound output remains the same.\n\nNot having to accommodate the angled back leg does, though, greatly reduce the\noverall depth of the AF8. In desktop stand configuration, the AF8’s footprint\ncomes in at 255mm; that’s 84mm less than the A1 when used in its floor-\nstanding mode.\n\nIf you prefer to wall-hang your TV, the AF8 will protrude just 76mm, compared\nwith a much more cumbersome 107mm with the A1. This makes the AF8 much more\n‘LCD like’ as a wall-mounting option. In fact, for me the A1 wasn’t really\npractical as a wall-mounting option at all, so the AF8 can be seen as Sony’s\nfirst truly wall-mountable OLED TV.\n\nOne other notable difference between Sony’s two OLED ranges is that the AF8\nwill only be available in 65- and 55-inch versions. There’s currently no\nsuggestion that there will be a 77-inch model like there is in the A1 range.\n\nPicture performance differences between the A1 and AF8 would be a major\ntalking point but, well, there aren’t any. Sony confirmed this with me during\nan in-depth meeting on its new TVs at CES.\n\nThis is perhaps a shame. Having made such a great job of its debut OLED TV,\nmany AV fans are seriously keen to see what Sony might achieve with its true\nsecond OLED generation. On the other hand, if the AF8 offers a similar level\nof performance to the A1 but – as I suspect – at a lower price point, then\nthat too should be welcomed by OLED fans currently thwarted by the A1’s\nrelatively high price.\n\n**Related:[Best 4K TVs](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-4k-tvs)**\n\nNeedless to say, we’ll be taking a look at the A8F in a lot more detail as\nsoon as we can get our hands-on one.\n\n**Are you excited by Sony’s new AF8 OLEDs?
