One of the first big exclusives for Sony’s console, it gave players the\nopportunity to explore a stylish open world with awesome superpowers. All\nthings considered, it was a great adventure with some truly gorgeous visuals.\nAlthough, it didn’t quite reach the heights of its predecessors.\n\nIf Sucker Punch is working on another entry in its superhero series, we know\nexactly what we’d love to see. _TrustedReviews_ has compiled all the latest\nnews, rumours, trailers, gameplay and more for Infamous 4.\n\n**Related:[Call of Duty: WWII](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/call-of-\nduty-ww2-release-date-trailers-multiplayer-gameplay-pre-order-screenshots-\nsystem-requirements)**  \n![Infamous: Second\nSon](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## What is Infamous 4?\n\nWe know very little about Infamous 4 so far. Will it continue the story of\nlovable rogue Delsin Rowe, following the ***spoilers*** tragic passing of his\nbrother towards the end of Second Son? His character had a ton of potential,\nand we’d love to see it expanded upon in a sequel.\n\n## Infamous 4 release date – When is it coming out?\n\nIt’s unlikely to be coming our way anytime soon, with rumours suggesting that\nSucker Punch’s next game will be a brand-new IP. But that’s not to say that a\nsequel is off the table altogether.\n\n**Related:[Best PS4 Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-\nps4-games_round-up)**  \n  \n[E3 2017](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/e3-2017-games-news-trailers)\nwould be the perfect time to spill the beans if Infamous 4 is in the works.\n\n## Infamous 4 wish list – What we’d love to see\n\n![infamous](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n**Take advantage of PS4 Pro**\n\nDespite launching over three years ago, Infamous: Second Son is still a\nbeautiful game to look at. A dynamic open world filled with unique NPCs and\nfluorescent particle effects, Delsin’s powers took great advantage of Sony’s\nburgeoning hardware. Now that [PS4\nPro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/ps4-pro-review) is out in the wild, we\nseriously want to see the Infamous series on a more powerful console.\n\nWe’ve already seen the likes of [Horizon: Zero\nDawn](https://www.trustedreviews.com/horizon-zero-dawn-review) and [The Last\nof Us: Remastered](https://www.trustedreviews.com/the-last-of-us-remastered-\nreview) putting the newly released system to brilliant use.\n[HDR](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/hdr-tv-high-dynamic-television-\nexplained) and [4K](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/4k-tv-10-reasons-\nwhy-you-should-care) checkerboarding should make for a visually spectacular\npackage once Infamous 4 rolls around.  \n**  \nAn improved setting**\n\nBe honest, Infamous: Second Son’s adaptation of Seattle was a little\nmiserable. The dingy backstreets and rain-drenched cityscape was a joy to\nclimb upon and looked lovely, but it simply wasn’t very fun to explore outside\nof the story missions. Side activities were little more than repetitive combat\ntrials and gimmicky mini-games with little to no substance.\n\n**Related:[Uncharted 5\nwishlist](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/uncharted-5-release-date-\ngameplay-rumours-wishlist-traiiler-news)**\n\nWe want Infamous 4 to break new ground with a setting that strikes a new\nstandard in terms of size and scope. When compared to the likes of other PS4\nexclusives such as [Uncharted\n4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/uncharted-4-review) and\n[Bloodborne](https://www.trustedreviews.com/bloodborne-review), the world of\nprevious Infamous games feel miniscule. They’re still great fun, but simply\ndon’t match up to their contemporaries.\n\n**A better morality system**\n\nInfamous: Second Son has an entertaining morality system, although it was\nlimited to being incredibly good or downright evil. Settling for a neutral\nmiddle-ground felt pointless, as you were stuck with hardly any worthwhile\npowers to upgrade. Cut-scenes also saw Delsin acting like a goody-two-shoes or\nan obnoxious asshat. At times, it felt jarring and unconvincing, lessening the\nimpact of a generic yet entertaining narrative.\n\n**Related:[Star Wars Battlefront 2 latest\nnews](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/star-wars-battlefront-2-release-\ndate-gameplay-trailer-preorder)**  \n![infamous](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nOne way to remedy such a transparent system could be through the addition of\ndialogue choices for the player. [The Witcher\n3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-review) had you\nforming Geralt’s moral compass as you progressed. Even [Mass Effect:\nAndromeda](https://www.trustedreviews.com/mass-effect-andromeda-review)\nevolved that series’ morality system to include a healthy shade of grey to the\nmix, so that the choices you made in the opening moments didn’t dictate every\nmove until the credits rolled. None of your words were guided by red/blue\noptions indicating the consequence of each word. Sucker Punch needn’t hold our\nhand, and may improve its narrative as a result.\n\n**Two playable characters**\n\nInfamous: Second Son had a fantastic expansion in the form of Infamous: First\nLight. You played as Fetch, a rebellious young woman with superpowers of her\nown. Despite its brevity, First Light was an excellent glimpse of Sucker\nPunch’s capabilities outside of its usual framework. It told a tragic story of\ndeath, betrayal and eventual triumph for Fetch. She’s a great character, and\nwould work well alongside Delsin Rowe if Infamous 4 becomes a reality.\n\nTwo playable protagonists could also lend the moment-to-moment gameplay an\nessential dose of variety. Having two suites of unique superpowers to\nexperiment with and upgrade would make switching between the two an event to\nlook forward to. That is, so long as they’re both perfectly capable of dishing\nout some damage and navigating the open world.\n\n**Watch: E3 2017 Predictions**\n\nWould you like to see Infamous 4 in the future?
