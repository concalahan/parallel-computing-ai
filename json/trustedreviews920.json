The tagline for said service, it seems, is\n“More Games. More Features. More Fun.”\n\n**Related:**[ **Best Nintendo Switch\ngames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/nintendo-switch-games-3435122)\n\nOne of the aforementioned fun features is support for cloud saved games.\nAnybody who pays the £20-per-year feature will be able to back up their saves\nto the cloud, which in practice looks like this:\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThat the update relates primarily to the online service is unsurprising.\nNintendo has already revealed that the Switch Online service [would be\nlaunching in September](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/switch-online-\nrelease-date-3528041), so preparing the millions of Switch consoles out there\nfor the big unveiling is only natural.\n\nBeyond cloud saves, we’re told to expect old NES games remastered for online\nmultiplayer, as well as the ability to keep playing the titles that already\nsupport online play.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n**Related:**[ **Nintendo Switch Online\nservices**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/nintendo-switch-\nonline-3469385)\n\nUnfortunately, there’s precious little in there which isn’t related to the\nupcoming online features. There’s a bunch of new icons from Captain Toad:\nTreasure Tracker. Two of the Captain himself, two of Toadette, one of Wingo\nand one of Draggadon. There are also new controller icons for the NES and\nSNES.\n\n> Aren't the Nintendo Switch controllers cool?\n[pic.twitter.com/MFtTtR1kRZ](https://t.co/MFtTtR1kRZ)\n\n>\n\n> — Eman Cisab (@shadowninja108) [August 31,\n2018](https://twitter.com/shadowninja108/status/1035416386460246016?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nOther than that, it just seems to be security measures designed to keep the\nSwitch safe from hacks that could leave it open to piracy and homebrew\nsoftware.\n\nSuffice it to say, plenty of users were hoping for a little more. “Just give\nus f****** folders,” [reads one comment on the Reddit\nthread](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/9br92a/datamine_nintendo_uploads_switch_firmware_600_to/e5581c2/).\n“Honestly Nintendo how f****** hard is it to add folders?”\n\n**Are you looking forward to Nintendo Switch Online, or do you think Nintendo\nshould be offering more for the money?
