The UK’s largest 4K network is offering the device to existing\ncustomers with no upfront cost on a two-year contract for £20 per month.\nThat’ll pay for the device over time, as well as unlimited data.\n\nEE will also supercharge customers’ smartphone data locker by an additional\n1GB per month, while minutes and texts allowances are shared with the\nsmartphone contact.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Watch 4G 42mm is\n[available](https://shop.ee.co.uk/watches/pay-monthly-watches/samsung-galaxy-\nwatch-4g-46mm-silver/details) with 4GB of storage, in both rose gold and\nmidnight black. The 46mm 4GB silver variant costs £20 up front, while the £20\nmonthly tariff over two years remains the same.\n\n**Related:[Best smartwatch](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nsmartwatch-3434307)**\n\nEE says the 4G version is exclusive to its online and brick & mortar stores in\nthe UK. Naturally, folks require a compatible Samsung smartphone on the EE\nnetwork with either a pay monthly or SIM-only plan to qualify.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nEE says the watch is expected to ship within 14 days. However, the launch\ncomes two months after T-Mobile subscribers in the US were able to pick up the\n4G version of Samsung’s latest smartphone.\n\nIn his review, our own Richard Easton awarded the Galaxy Watch an 8/10 score,\npraising the smart design and the rotating bezel-based UI. He was also\nimpressed by the bright and sharp display and the offline Spotify support.\n\nHowever, he didn’t see enough of a departure from previous Samsung watches,\nwas unsatisfied with the Bixby assistant, and bemoaned the lack of available\napps and Samsung Pay support.\n\n**Will you be grabbing the Galaxy Watch 4G on EE?
