Of course, you are reliant instead on a decent mobile signaland data connection, but even in the deepest parts of rural Britain there’s atleast some basic coverage.The simplified interface Android Auto and CarPlay provide on top on aninfotainment system allows for simple navigation of the app, with the goal ofpreventing a driver from being distracted from having their eyes off the roadfor too long.The iPlayer Radio app itself is fairly well featured, with four sections tohelp motorists quickly select stations, access podcasts and shows that havebeen downloaded onto their mobile, select shows to listen to at a later date,and a shortcut to stations that the user has subscribed to.**Related:[How to install Kodi on a FireStick](https://www.trustedreviews.com/how-tos/install-kodi-fire-tv-stick)****Do you own a car that’s compatible with Android Auto or CarPlay?
