Now we’re left wondering\nhow Samsung’s next flagship will handle the issue – and we might have our best\nclue yet.**\n\nWhile the likes of the [OnePlus\n6T](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/oneplus-6t), [Google Pixel 3\nXL](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-3-xl) and [Huawei Mate\n20 Pro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/huawei-mate-20-pro) feature a\nscreen cutout, Samsung has continued to resist the trend, and the company\ncould go to extreme lengths to keep the upcoming [Samsung Galaxy\nS10](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/galaxy-s10-release-date-specs-\nrumours-3456012) notch-free.\n\n**Read more:[Best smartphone](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nsmartphone-3431175)**\n\n[According to](http://www.etnews.com/20181101000423) a report from South\nKorean publication ETNews (via\n[SamMobile](https://www.sammobile.com/2018/11/02/samsung-ditch-\ngalaxy-s10-iris-scanner/)), none of the three S10 variants we’re expecting\nwill feature an iris scanner.\n\nETNews claims the “top two” S10 models will feature a supersonic in-display\nfingerprint reader, while the cheaper variant will be equipped with either an\noptical in-display fingerprint reader or a side-mounted fingerprint reader.\n\nBut why would Samsung ditch a feature that has been a mainstay of all of its\nflagships since the [Note 7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-\ngalaxy-note-7), back in 2016?\n\nThe company reportedly wants the S10 to not only be notchless, but to also\nhave a smaller forehead and chin than the Samsung Galaxy S9, and the iris\nscanner could be a key barrier to this vision.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nWhat’s more, this rumour also seems to stack up with recent reports suggesting\nthat the S10’s front-facing will not sit above the phone’s display, but will\ninstead be embedded underneath it, in order to save space.\n\nHowever, as none of this is yet confirmed, we’d advise taking it with a pinch\nof salt.\n\n**Read more:[Best Android phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nandroid-phones-3438996)**\n\nThat said, considering some of notch-related burns Samsung has dished out in\nthe recent past, we’d be shocked if the South Korean giant ever embraced this\nparticular design trend.
