Your data allowanceaffects how much you’re able to stream, browse the web, message using appslike WhatsApp or make video calls (while away from trusty Wi-Fi), basicallyall of the good stuff.Data allowance is therefore the main thing that separates most contracts,because the age where minutes and texts were most important are long gone.Most contracts will just give you an unlimited amount of minutes and texts.If you’re only a light data user, you can get away with 4-8GB a month, whichwill still let you stream music and watch occasional Netflix over 4G. Ifyou’re a heavy streamer or want to tether your mobile connection to anotherdevice, you’ll want at least 10GB of data a month. Many of the deals availabletoday are actually cheaper for the data heavier options. You can never havetoo much data, after all.### Decide what you can afford to pay upfrontTypically, the more you’re willing to spend upfront, the lower your monthlycost will be. Spending more upfront can also reduce the amount you pay overthe course of your contract, which is typically 24 months.This is called your total cost of ownership (TCO), which is your monthly costx the term of your contract + any upfront cost.If you don’t have the money to splash out at the beginning, look for acontract with a low upfront cost, some contracts will even completely foregoany upfront cost, which is handy and can open up the door to grabbing yourfavourite new smartphone while spreading the cost.### How to choose the right mobile networkYou might be happy with the service and benefits of your current network, butwe think it’s always worth shopping around to see what kind of benefits othernetworks are bundling into their mobile phone contracts.The main providers are offering some incredibly tempting extras and flexiblecontract options at the moment. It’s worth comparing these as they can add alot of extra value to your contract. Take EE, for instance; it offers freeApple Music for six months on certain contracts.
