It sits between the company’s elderly Pixel C tablet and\ntop-end Pixelbook convertible, targetting the same space as Apple’s [iPad\nPro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/ipad-pro) and Microsoft’s [Surface\nPro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/surface-pro).\n\nFor Chromebook fans and basic users on the market for a slick, easy-to-carry\ntablet-cum-laptop, on paper this is a pretty enticing device.\n\nBut with Chrome OS’s app offering being well behind Apple’s, and key creative\nsuites such as [Affinity\nDesigner](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/affinity-designer) and\nAffinity Photo not running on it, is there enough on display to lure creatives\naway from iOS?\n\nFrom what I’ve seen after a hands-on go with the Pixel Slate, quite possibly,\nbut only with more work on the OS app offering. Here’s everything you need to\nknow about the Google Pixel Slate.\n\n**Related:[Best laptops for\nstudents](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-student-laptop-3444216)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Google Pixel Slate – Price\n\nThe Pixel Slate will be available in four different version in the UK. The\ncheapest will set you back £549.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\n  * \n\nThe keyboard will set you back another £200 and the Pixel Pen a further £99.\nThis puts it in the same price bracket as both the iPad Pro and Surface Pro,\ndepending on what spec you pick.\n\n## Google Pixel Slate – Release date\n\nGoogle hasn’t given the Pixel Slate a specific release date. The only\ninformation we have is that it’ll be this year.\n\n**Related:[Best laptop](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nlaptops-3431966)**\n\n## Google Pixel Slate – Design\n\nThe Pixel Slate looks more like the [Galaxy Tab\nS4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-tab-s4) and iPad Pro\nthan Google’s last convertible, the Pixel Book. The slim 7mm-thick tablet\nsection comes in a fairly deep midnight blue colouring and has slightly\nrounded edges plus a 2.5D screen.\n\nThe display is far from edge-to-edge, but in hand, the tablet’s metal chassis\nfeels every bit as premium as the iPad Pro and it has all the trimmings of a\nmodern convertible. It’ll charge using a USB-C cable, and has a fingerprint\nscanner built into the side-facing power button.\n\nOn its front, you’ll see twin dual-speakers that Google claims “are custom-\ntuned to deliver industry-leading audio”. I didn’t get a chance to test the\nspeakers during my demo, due to the noisy press room conditions, but the lack\nof Dolby Atmos branding is a minor disappointment given its appearance on many\nother modern tablets and convertibles.\n\nDolby Atmos on a tablet is a virtual surround sound that aims to make gaming\nand movie-watching more immersive. It’s worked a treat on past mobile devices\nI’ve tested with it.\n\nThe big differentiator design-wise stems from its atypical keyboard design and\ndocking mechanism. For starters, the Pixel Slate’s option folio keyboard cover\nis full-sized. This is a big step up on the iPad Pro keyboard cover, which is\nsquished no matter how you look at it. It also has a full-sized trackpad,\nwhich makes using it as a laptop/Chromebook far more pleasant.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nI’m also pleased that the snap magnetic docking system lets you set it at any\nangle you like and doesn’t give you a limited number of angles, as the iPad\nPro does.\n\nTyping on it, the keys were noticeably more reactive and suitably spread out\nso that I could see myself working a full day on the Pixel Slate. Though until\nI use it a little longer I can’t confirm this.\n\n**Related:[Best tablet](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\ntablet-3438986)**\n\n## Google Pixel Slate – Specs and Chrome OS\n\nUnder the hood, things get more interesting. Google is offering the Pixel\nStore in a variety of different configurations. You can see a breakdown of\nthem in the tablet below.\n\n**Spec** | **Option One** | **Option two** | **Option three** | **Option\nfour**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n**Display** |  12.3-inch 3000×2000 (293 ppi) LCD display, 400 nits for use in\nbright areas\n\n72% NTSC colour\n\n|  12.3-inch 3000×2000 (293 ppi) LCD display, 400 nits for use in bright areas\n\n72% NTSC colour\n\n|  12.3-inch 3000×2000 (293 ppi) LCD display, 400 nits for use in bright areas\n\n72% NTSC colour\n\n|  12.3-inch 3000×2000 (293 ppi) LCD display, 400 nits for use in bright areas\n\n72% NTSC colour  \n  \n**CPU** |  Intel Celeron | Unspecified Intel Core M3 | Unspecified Intel Core\ni5 | Unspecified Intel Core i7  \n**Memory** |  4GB/8GB | 8GB | 8GB | 16GB  \n**Storage** |  32GB/64GB | 64GB | 128GB | 256GB  \n**Battery** |  48 Wh | 48 Wh | 48 Wh | 48 Wh  \n**Camera** |  8-megapixel front and back | 8-megapixel front and back |\n8-megapixel front and back | 8-megapixel front and back  \n**Price** |  £549 | £749 | £969 | £1549  \n  \nThe screen is one area I’m particularly interested in. The iPad Pro’s Trutone\nscreen is a key selling point. This is because it’s been tailor-made for\ncreative work and targets the DCI-P3 colour gamut favoured by artists and\ncinematographers. Coupled with the Apple Pencil and a full suite of creative\napps designed for the tablet, this made it one of the only non-Windows\nconvertibles I’ve ever tested that I’d happily use for photo-editing and\ndigital painting.\n\nGoogle claims it’s optimised the screen to offer ‘accurate colours’, but has\nshied away from giving screen temperature, Delta E or colour gamut coverage\nfigures, which makes doing a direct comparison without a colourimeter hard.\nBut my naked eye impressions were positive. The screen didn’t look overcooked\nand whites were nicely clean. Judging blacks was all but impossible in the\nconditions but didn’t look terrible.\n\nThis means, if you pay for a top i5 or i7 version, it should be powerful\nenough to do basic creative work, though I wouldn’t want to do anything too\ntaxing like video editing.\n\nMy bigger concern, as ever, is its use of Chrome OS. Chrome OS is great for\nbasic web browsing and media streaming, and runs wonderfully well on low power\nhardware. Which is why it can work smoothly on a Celeron CPU. But the app\noffering isn’t there for power users.\n\nPretty much all the apps focus on entertainment, or office work, like the\nnewly added Adobe Acrobat suite. Hardcore digital painting, vector, 3D\nmodelling and video-editing apps are few and far between.\n\nGoogle claims you can get around this by installing full-fat Linux apps, like\nGIMP or Blender in a secure container. This is possible, but I just can’t see\nsomeone wanting to do it when they’re already paying the price of a Surface\nPro or iPad Pro, which have apps that work on them out of the box.\n\nHopefully, I’ll be proven wrong come my full review. Otherwise, I can only\nreally see the lower power and cost models winning people\nover.![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Google Pixel Slate – Opening impressions\n\nThe Pixel Slate is a beautiful looking Chrome OS convertible that has the\nchops to be a fantastic travel companion, student laptop replacement and\nmobile workstation for basic office busywork.\n\nIt looks gorgeous and from what I’ve seen has one of the best keyboard covers\navailable on a tablet. My only concern is that, like the Pixel Book before it,\nthere won’t be enough apps to justify the top specced version’s price, which\nwill put off power and creative users.\n\n"}
