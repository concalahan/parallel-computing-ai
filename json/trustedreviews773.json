Spend a couple of minutes now to get yourself set up, and you’ll never\nworry about it again.**\n\nYou’ll have heard countless times that about how important it is to protect\nyour online privacy and security. You wouldn’t leave your PIN number lying\naround, so why would you play fast and loose with your online passwords when\nthey can provide access to exactly the same bank accounts?\n\nThankfully, being that little bit more safe online isn’t nearly as much of a\nhassle as it might at first seem. Most of the steps we’ve outlined below take\na matter of minutes to complete, after which you can get on with your life as\nusual.\n\nAfter compiling our list of recommended steps, we sat down with cybersecurity\nexpert Ed Williams, who heads up SpiderLabs at Trustwave EMEA. Ed has spent\nthe best part of a decade doing penetration testing and consulting for various\ngovernment and private sector organisations.\n\nWithout further ado, here are the most effective steps you can take to staying\nsafe online.\n\n## 1) Use a Password Manager\n\n**Ed Williams’ effectiveness ranking − 5/5**\n\nOf all the steps you can take in our list, a password manager is the single\nmost effective. When testing for vulnerabilities, weak passwords are the first\nthing that Williams and his team attack, because so many people use either\neasy to guess passwords or ones that are used across multiple online accounts.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n“I, for example, use 20 to 30 passwords a day and I’m sure most people are the\nsame, so having something that manages all of that and then ensures these\npasswords are non-shared is a really important thing,” he says.\n\nA password manager is important because using the same password for every\nsingle website is incredibly insecure. The chances of Amazon getting hacked\nand your account password getting stolen is fairly low. But if you use the\nsame password for a much smaller, less secure site, a hacker could easily gain\naccess to your Amazon account that way.\n\nA password manager solves this issue by making it easy to generate a secure,\nunique password for every site. It then remembers these for you, and lets you\naccess them from any device you’d need them on.\n\nYou’ve got a couple of options if you want to start using a password manager.\nLastPass is the manager we’ve got the most experience with, but check out our\nfull guide below for all of our top picks.\n\n**Related:[Best password manager](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\npassword-manager)**\n\nOnce you’ve set your password manager up, you’ll need to import all your\npasswords, go through your list, and generate unique passwords for any\naccounts that might be using the exact same login details.\n\nThis takes a little bit of time, but once everything’s set up your password\nmanager of choice will make it really easy to create a brand new password you\nhaven’t used elsewhere.\n\nThe final point is to make sure your ‘Master Password’ − which you use to\nunlock your password manager − is as secure as it can be. We’d recommend the\n[Diceware](http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html) method to generate a\npassword that’s both strong and reasonably easy to remember.\n\nFor the love of god, _please_ don’t reuse your everything password.\n\n## 2) Enable two-factor authentication\n\n**Ed Williams’ effectiveness ranking − 5/5**\n\nAlong with a strong, unique password, two-factor authentication (aka 2FA) is a\nmust if you want to keep yourself secure online.\n\n“If your passwords are compromised for whatever reason, whether it’s a website\nbeing compromised or you’ve just slipped up, having that second factor of\nauthentication makes it a lot harder for someone to get into your account,”\nWilliams explains.\n\nYou know when you try to sign into a service and it sends you a text message\nwith a code that you need to enter? That’s two-factor authentication, and it\nprevents anyone from getting into your account even if they’ve figured out\nyour password.\n\nThat said, if you’re still using SMS text messages to get your codes, then\nyou’re exposing yourself to a pretty serious vulnerability.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nGoogle Authenticator is a great free app for all your two-factor\nauthentication needs\n\nAs Williams explains, “You shouldn’t be using two-factor authentication with\nSMS because SMS isn’t a secure protocol.” This potentially makes your code\nvulnerable to snoopers.\n\nInstead, it’s much better to use a dedicated authentication app, and there are\nplenty of options out there. Williams recommends Google Authenticator for its\nsimplicity, but we also like Duo because certain sites will support push\nnotifications, which drastically reduces the amount of time it takes to log\nin.\n\nGetting set up with these apps is a simple matter of using the app to scan a\nQR code on the website you want to enable 2FA on, and searching for the\nwebsite’s two-factor authentication details using Google will usually get you\nto the relevant help page.\n\nOnce you’ve logged in using 2FA once, most sites will allow you to save your\nbrowser for a certain amount of time, meaning you won’t have to constantly\nreach for your phone just to get on Twitter.\n\n## 3) Get your browser set up for security\n\n**Ed Williams’ effectiveness ranking − 3-5/5**\n\nThe browser is your gateway to the internet, so it makes sense to make it as\nsecure as possible.\n\nThere are dedicated secure browsers out there like Tor or Avast Secure\nBrowser, but when we asked Williams about these he thought most users would be\nfar better served by kitting out their existing mainstream browser of choice\nwith carefully selected privacy-focused extensions.\n\nThere are four of five different tasks that these extensions need to\naccomplish, and depending on which extensions you choose, you might be able to\nget one extension that does everything, or pick a separate extension for each\ntask. A couple of these settings can be handled with the browser itself,\nwithout the need for any third-party software.\n\nThe most important of these is to block third-party software like Flash and\nJavascript from automatically running (a move that Williams ranks 5/5 for\neffectiveness). New security vulnerabilities are constantly being discovered\nin software like this, and although they’re frequently patched you can still\nfind yourself exposed.\n\nWilliams even warns that these plugins can be compromised to the extent that\nthey’d allow someone to take control of your laptop.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nImage Credit: Dmitry Baranovskiy / Flickr\n\nThis is a setting you can change from within Chrome or Firefox, and you should\nalways have your browser set to block plugins by default. Certain useful web\napplications do rely on them, but in these cases it’s always better to enable\nthem on an individual basis once you know they’re using the plugin for a\nuseful purpose.\n\nNext is an adblocker (which Williams gives a 4.5/5 rating) for much the same\nreason. Ads are frequently the source of malicious code on websites, which\nmakes an adblocker a useful tool for staying safe online.\n\nThat said, a large portion of the web relies solely on advertising to generate\nrevenue, and blocking every single advert would destroy the internet as we\nknow it. Thankfully, extensions like Adblock allow you to let through adverts\nwhich are deemed to be non-intrusive. We’d recommend turning this option on.\n\nThe third most important browser tweak to make is to force it to use HTTPS\nrather than HTTP wherever possible (rated 4/5). HTTPS is a much more secure\nprotocol for browsing the web, but many sites don’t use it by default.\nAlthough it’s impossible to force every site to use HTTPS, with the right\nextension you can make sure that it’s always used when there’s a possibility\nof doing so.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe final two steps you can take are more optional than necessary, but since\nthey’re free you might still find them helpful.\n\nThe first is to obscure location data (rated 3/5 by Ed). While you move across\nthe internet there are relatively few legitimate reasons for a website to know\nwhere you’re accessing it from (for example, Google Maps needs to know where\nyou are in order to provide directions), so it’s best to leave that off by\ndefault.\n\nFinally, certain extensions will allow you to mask further information about\nyourself, for example hiding the type and version of the browser that you’re\nusing. Yes, this allows you to further anonymise yourself online, but the\nbenefit is fairly minimal at this point.\n\nThat’s a long list of things to accomplish, but depending on what you opt for,\nyou use you might be able to cover them off with just one or two extensions.\n\nWe initially liked the [DuckDuckGo\nextension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/duckduckgo-privacy-\nessent/bkdgflcldnnnapblkhphbgpggdiikppg?hl=en) because it includes much of\nwhat we’ve discussed above, plus a couple of additional features like blocking\nadvertising trackers (“You can just enable it and not have to think about it\ntoo much,” says Williams). It works well, but we grew frustrated by the way it\nforced us to use DuckDuckGo’s own search engine by default.\n\nAs a result, for the majority of the options above we’d actually advise just\ntweaking your Chrome or Firefox settings, while using a third-party adblocker\nlike Adblock on the latter browser. The extension HTTPS Everywhere is a good\noption on Chrome if you want to force sites to support the encrypted protocol\nwhere possible.\n\n## 4) Use a secure DNS\n\n**Ed Williams’ effectiveness ranking − 4/5**\n\nYou may never heard of DNS before. It’s one of those incredibly unsexy parts\nof how the web works, and it’s basically responsible for turning the words\n[www.trustedreviews.com](https://www.trustedreviews.com) into the specific IP\naddress that will allow your browser to show the contents of our site.\n\nBy default, you’re almost certainly using your ISP’s default DNS service, and\nin terms of your online security this is a pretty bad idea.\n\n“There have been a number of issues and a number of vulnerabilities around DNS\nacross the last 25 years,” Williams explains, “The primary reason for that is\nthat everything is just clear text, so ISPs are large organisations are very\nquickly able to work out what you’re looking at and what you’re doing online.”\n\nThankfully, your DNS is the easiest thing to solve about your internet setup,\nand you’ll even get a nice little speed boost in the process.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCloudfire’s 1.1.1.1 DNS service is a small but effective step you can take to\nprotect your online privacy\n\nThe DNS service that’s been making waves recently with its commitment to\nsecurity and privacy is CloudFire’s service. The Primary DNS address that you\nwant to be using here is 1.1.1.1, while the secondary one is 1.0.0.1. Google’s\nown DNS service (8.8.8.8 / 8.8.4.4) will also encrypt your traffic, but\nCloudFire has also committed to purging its logs every day to limit the amount\nof your data it holds over time.\n\nThe most effective way to change your DNS settings is to go into your router’s\nsettings and change the settings there. You can log into your router by typing\nin the IP address that’s usually printed on a sticker on the router, and\nnavigating to the advanced options. After this point, anything device you\nconnect to your home network will access the internet via this secure DNS.\n\nYou can also change your DNS settings on a device-by-device basis, which is\nhelpful if you have a phone or a laptop that connects to different Wi-Fi\nhotspots throughout the day. Changing these DNS settings varies based on your\noperating system, so you’re best off seeking that information out yourself.\n\nOf all the options on this list, changing your DNS settings takes the least\namount of time and gives the biggest privacy benefit.\n\n## 5) Turn on your antivirus\n\n**Ed Williams’ effectiveness ranking − 4/5**\n\nUsing some form of antivirus software is essential the moment you connect your\ncomputer to the internet, but Williams is less convinced that you need to\ninstall third-party software in addition to what already comes built into your\noperating system.\n\n“There’s been a lot of issues and a lot of vulnerabilities associated with\nantivirus software because it creates an additional interface. Antivirus\nsoftware will need to run with big privileges on your machine, because it\nneeds to see everything,” Williams warns. “Personally I would just stick with\nwhat’s inbuilt.”\n\nHowever, just because your operating system has antivirus built in, that\ndoesn’t mean you can just turn it on and forget about it.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nHe recommends making sure it’s set to scan everything your computer downloads\nfrom the internet, to avoid any malicious code finding its way onto your\ndevice. Also, be sure to actually act on the notifications your system sends\nyou.\n\nAs Williams puts it, “Antivirus isn’t a silver bullet by any stretch, but it’s\nbetter than nothing in this day and age.”\n\n## 6) Use a VPN if you’re serious\n\n**Ed Williams’ effectiveness ranking − 2-3/5**\n\nVPNs have exploded in popularity in recent years, and with good reason. The\ntechnology essentially acts as an encrypted tunnel, taking your traffic in and\ndelivering it to anywhere in the world you’ve specified.\n\nIf someone’s snooping on your traffic, they’ll be able to see that you’re\nconnecting to a VPN, but they won’t be able to see where your traffic is\ngoing.\n\nHowever, while Williams agrees that VPNs are very good at what they do, he\nbelieves they’re less useful for your average consumer.\n\n### Today's Best VPN Deals\n\n[](https://www.linkev.com/stream-\nsports/ufc/buy?offer=3monthsfree&a_fid=timeincuk&data1=trustedreviews&data2=UFC)\n\n[](https://www.linkev.com/stream-\nsports/ufc/buy?offer=3monthsfree&a_fid=timeincuk&data1=trustedreviews&data2=UFC)\n\n###\n\n[ExpressVPN | $99.95/£70.53 per year ($6.67/£5.12 per month)\n\n](https://www.linkev.com/stream-\nsports/ufc/buy?offer=3monthsfree&a_fid=timeincuk&data1=trustedreviews&data2=UFC)\n\nExpressVPN provides a fast, stable and feature-packed service that did well in\nour speed tests and proved useful for international media streaming.\n\n[ExpressVPN\n\n](https://www.linkev.com/stream-\nsports/ufc/buy?offer=3monthsfree&a_fid=timeincuk&data1=trustedreviews&data2=UFC)\n\n[View Deal](https://www.linkev.com/stream-\nsports/ufc/buy?offer=3monthsfree&a_fid=timeincuk&data1=trustedreviews&data2=UFC)\n\n[ExpressVPN\n\n](https://www.linkev.com/stream-\nsports/ufc/buy?offer=3monthsfree&a_fid=timeincuk&data1=trustedreviews&data2=UFC)\n\n[](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/buy-\nvpn/trustedreviews&referrer=https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-vpn)\n\n[](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/buy-\nvpn/trustedreviews&referrer=https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-vpn)\n\n###\n\n[Private Internet Access | $69.95/£52 per 2 years ($2.91/£2.17 per month)\n\n](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/buy-\nvpn/trustedreviews&referrer=https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-vpn)\n\nOne of the least expensive, most feature-packed services around and has a\ntested no-logging policy.\n\n[Private Internet Access\n\n](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/buy-\nvpn/trustedreviews&referrer=https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-vpn)\n\n[View Deal](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/buy-\nvpn/trustedreviews&referrer=https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-vpn)\n\n[Private Internet Access\n\n](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/buy-\nvpn/trustedreviews&referrer=https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-vpn)\n\n[](https://nordvpn.com/?utm_medium=affiliate&utm_term&utm_content&utm_campaign=off15&utm_source=aff5855)\n\n[](https://nordvpn.com/?utm_medium=affiliate&utm_term&utm_content&utm_campaign=off15&utm_source=aff5855)\n\n###\n\n[NordVPN | $69/£49 per year ($5.75/£4 per month)\n\n](https://nordvpn.com/?utm_medium=affiliate&utm_term&utm_content&utm_campaign=off15&utm_source=aff5855)\n\nNordVPN consistently performs well in our tests, with an excellent range of\nfeatures at a low cost.\n\n[NordVPN\n\n](https://nordvpn.com/?utm_medium=affiliate&utm_term&utm_content&utm_campaign=off15&utm_source=aff5855)\n\n[View\nDeal](https://nordvpn.com/?utm_medium=affiliate&utm_term&utm_content&utm_campaign=off15&utm_source=aff5855)\n\n[NordVPN\n\n](https://nordvpn.com/?utm_medium=affiliate&utm_term&utm_content&utm_campaign=off15&utm_source=aff5855)\n\n“I know that VPNs are really good, but are they reasonable for most users? I’d\nprobably say they’re not,” Williams cautions, “If you put everything else in\nplace such as a password manager and two-factor authentication, then I’d say\nthat a VPN is less important.”\n\nAs a result, unless you’re using a VPN to access content from another country,\nyou probably don’t need to worry about paying for one to protect your privacy\nand security online.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Final thoughts: Encrypted messaging\n\nSo far we’ve mainly been discussing steps you can take to browse the internet\nsecurely, but of course a large part of what we use the internet for is\nmessaging, which isn’t necessarily encrypted by default.\n\nThe good news though, is that an increasing number of messaging apps are\nencrypting your conversations.\n\nThe most prominent of these is WhatsApp, which has offered end-to-end\nencryption for its messages since 2016. That means that no one, not even\nWhatsApp itself, can see what you’re sending to your friends. Apple’s iMessage\nis also similarly encrypted.\n\nIf you want an even more secure messaging app, you might want to consider\nusing Signal, which not only encrypts your messages but also discards your\nmetadata whenever it can, offering an additional layer of privacy.\n\nIn an ideal world everyone would be using Signal, but in reality you’re likely\ngoing to need to make compromises in order to be on the same platform as your\ncontacts. In these instances we think WhatsApp is an acceptable compromise.\n\nTry to avoid using SMS to send sensitive information, as it’s entirely\nunencrypted. You have been warned.\n\n**Have you got any tips for staying safe online? Get in touch with us on\nTwitter or Facebook @TrustedReviews.**\n\n"}
