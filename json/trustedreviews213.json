Given that most of the major updates for the new range are\ninternal, there’s very little on the surface to separate the iPhone X from its\nsuccessors. Plus, the high price tag for both the iPhone XS and the XS Max is\nsure to make the iPhone X a far more desirable option for some over the coming\nmonths.\n\n**Related:**[iPhone X vs iPhone\nXS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-xs-vs-iphone-x-3564940)\n\nThe only major competitor, which you might have already considered, is the\nupcoming iPhone XR. Billed as the “affordable” option of Apple’s latest\nsmartphones, the iPhone XR features the same end-to-end screen of the iPhone\nX, but with an LCD screen and a minimum price point of £749. All of that seems\nfine on paper, particularly as the iPhone X originally went for £999 at\nlaunch, but it seems jarring against the current prices of the iPhone X.\n\n### Top iPhone X deals right now\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=3202&clickref=TR-\nBestMobileDeals&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fapple%2Fiphone-x-64gb-\nspace-grey)\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=3202&clickref=TR-\nBestMobileDeals&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fapple%2Fiphone-x-64gb-\nspace-grey)\n\n###\n\n[iPhone X 64GB – 60GB of data on EE\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=3202&clickref=TR-\nBestMobileDeals&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fapple%2Fiphone-x-64gb-\nspace-grey)\n\nWith 60GB in your pocket each month, you'll never be left scrounging for any\ndata, plus, with no upfront costs there's a lot to love about this contract\nfrom EE.\n\n[Buymobiles.net\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=3202&clickref=TR-\nBestMobileDeals&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fapple%2Fiphone-x-64gb-\nspace-grey)\n\n|\n\nNo upfront\n\n|\n\nNow £58/month\n\n[View\nDeal](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=3202&clickref=TR-\nBestMobileDeals&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fapple%2Fiphone-x-64gb-\nspace-grey)\n\nNow £58/month\n\n|\n\nNo upfront\n\n|\n\n[Buymobiles.net\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=3202&clickref=TR-\nBestMobileDeals&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fapple%2Fiphone-x-64gb-\nspace-grey)\n\nFor example, you can get the iPhone X SIM-free right now for just [£824.99 on\nAmazon](https://amzn.to/2NvhkJW). It’s also worth mentioning that outside of\nhaving a faster processor (thanks to the new A12 bionic chip) and dual-SIM\nfunctionality, the iPhone X is superior than the XR in the camera and screen\ndepartments. The iPhone X has two rear-facing cameras and a 458ppi screen\nwhile the iPhone XR has only one rear-facing camera and a lower screen density\nwith 326ppi.\n\nIf the iPhone X sounds like the best bet for you then take a gander below at\nour handy collection of the best iPhone X deals.

It’s the model\nto mark the tenth anniversary of Apple’s famous smartphone (hence it’s meant\nto be pronounced iPhone ‘ten’).\n\nAfter Apple released a few generation’s worth of iPhones that all largely\nlooked the same, the iPhone X introduces an iconic and easily-recognisable new\ndesign. One noticeable change is the ditching of the ‘Home’ button everyone\nhad grown to associate with the iPhone.\n\nBy taking it away, it means the iPhone X now has more screen than any iPhone\nbefore, with a much higher screen-to-body ratio that reaches practically edge-\ntoe-edge now. Instead of the Home button, you now use gestures to navigate\nyour way around, making for a more intuitive experience and offering way more\nscreen than before.\n\nIt’s a beautiful 5.8-inch OLED HDR screen, too, that makes colours look\ngorgeous. Removing the bezels means you get more screen in a body that’s\nactually smaller than the iPhone 8 Plus. So perfectly pocketable but with\nloads of display.\n\nThere are also dual cameras on the back with optical image stabilisation for\nsharper shots. They’re some of the best we’ve seen from a smartphone. Now that\nthe Home button is gone, that means no Touch ID. In its place you have the\nmore user-friendly Face ID to securely unlock your phone using the front-\nfacing camera. This clever tech also allows for new Animoji or ‘animated\nemojis’ that inject more personality in your messages.\n\nBecause the back is now made from glass, the iPhone X now also supports\nconveniently wireless fast charging. Goodbye frayed Lightning cables.\n\n* * *\n\n### iPhone X not the phone for you?\n\n**Consider these:**\n\n  * **Related:** [Best iPhone XS deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-iphone-xs-deals-3565210)\n  * **Related:** [Best iPhone XS Max deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-iphone-xs-max-deals-3565655)\n  * **Related:**[Best iPhone 7 deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-iphone-7-deals-2993225)\n  * **Related:** [Best iPhone 8 deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-iphone-8-deals-3260322)\n  * **Related:** [Best iPhone 8 Plus deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-iphone-8-plus-deals-3289474)\n  * **Related:** [Best Samsung Galaxy S9 deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s9-deals-3402357)\n  * **Related:** [Best Samsung Galaxy S8 deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-samsung-galaxy-s8-deals-2993182)\n  * **Related:** [Best Huawei P20 deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-huawei-p20-pro-deals-3433993)\n  * **Related:**[Best SIM only deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-sim-only-deals-2943877)\n\n* * *\n\n## How to choose the best iPhone X deals for you\n\n![iPhone\nX](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\n### Make sure you have enough data\n\nPractically every contract is going to offer you more than enough minutes and\ntexts than you’ll ever need, if not just providing an unlimited amount. Most\npeople will therefore prioritise how much data is provided each month, as this\nwill impact how much browsing and streaming you can do.\n\nAs more and more of us use the likes of iMessage, FaceTime, WhatsApp or\nFacebook Messenger to message and call one another, traditional texts and\nminutes are also becoming more redundant. It’s all about that data when\npicking the best iPhone X deals.\n\nIf you’re going to be a moderate data user – such as streaming only a little\nNetflix, YouTube or Spotify over 4G – then you’ll want to aim for at least\n5-10GB of data a month. If you plan on tethering your 4G connection, so that\nyou can have internet access on your laptop or tablet, you’ll likely want to\nhave at least 15GB of data each month, if not more. Just be sure to check how\nmuch data you’re allowed to use while tethered, as some operators limit your\nuse.\n\nCompare contract prices between lower data and higher data tariffs, too.\nIncreasingly, you get a much better deal for more data, sometimes paying the\nsame money as you would for less. There’s really no reason not to go for more\ndata than you think you might need in that case. It’ll leave you some\nbreathing room if you do suddenly find yourself binge-watching your favourite\nshow on your next train journey.\n\n![iPhone\nX](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\n### Decide what you’re willing to pay upfront\n\nAs mentioned, the Apple iPhone X is a seriously pricey phone if you buy it SIM\nfree. Not everyone has £999.99 lying around to buy one outright, so a contract\nis the best way to get hold of a shiny new iPhone and spread the cost.\n\nDifferent contracts will have different upfront costs, which is the amount you\npay at the beginning for the iPhone X. Paying more at the beginning can mean\npaying less each month, and vice versa. Typically, if you pay more upfront\nyou’ll spend less over the course of the contract (called the Total Cost of\nOwnership or TCO).\n\nTo work out the TCO of a contract, simply multiply the monthly cost by the\nterm of the contract (typically 24 months), then add the upfront cost. When\nfinding the best iPhone X deals, you might be put off by a higher TCO, but\nkeep in mind your personal financial circumstances. While you might end up\npaying more in the long run, a lower upfront cost could be the key to landing\nyourself your perfect phone while spreading the cost to something you’re\ncomfortable with.\n\n### How to pick a network provider\n\nBeyond just the price of the contracts, there are a range of reasons to think\nabout what network provider you want to sign up with.\n\nIn the past, you might have gotten perks like free calls to the same network,\nbut considering you now get more minutes and texts than you’ll probably ever\nneed, making sure you’re on the same phone network as your friends and family\nis no longer an issue.\n\nBut there are other things to consider when deciding which network provider to\nuse.\n\nFirst off, you’ll want to make sure you have good network coverage for both\ncalls and 4G. You don’t want to find out you’re living in a blackspot. You can\ncheck the network coverage of the big networks using these links:\n\n  * [O2 network coverage checker](https://www.o2.co.uk/coveragechecker)\n  * [Vodafone network coverage checker](https://www.vodafone.co.uk/explore/network/uk-coverage-map/index.htm)\n  * [EE network coverage checker](https://ee.co.uk/why-ee/mobile-coverage)\n  * [Three network coverage checker](http://www.three.co.uk/Discover/Network/Coverage)\n  * [iD network coverage checker](https://www.idmobile.co.uk/help-and-advice/uk-coverage-checker)\n\nJust pop a postcode in and you’ll be able to see everything from 2G, 3G and 4G\ncoverage. Be sure to check any places you’ll regularly be using your phone\nsuch as your home and work.\n\n![Three wi-fi\ncalling](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Wi-Fi Calling\n\nOne way to get around spotty network coverage is Wi-Fi Calling. This is a\nfeature now supported by all four of the UK’s big network operators and\nessentially lets you use a Wi-Fi internet connection to make and receive calls\nand texts.\n\nThis is far more reliable and better quality than relying on network reception\nand lets you still use your phone anywhere you have an internet connection.\n\nYour call minutes and text messages are still taken out of your standard\ntariff when using Wi-Fi Calling.\n\nIt simply requires you to turn on the necessary settings on a compatible\nphone. You can find out more about each network’s Wi-Fi Calling and how to\nactivate it here: [EE](https://ee.co.uk/help/help-new/getting-started-and-\nupgrading/using-your-phone-features/how-do-i-use-wifi-calling) |\n[Three](http://www.three.co.uk/discover/three_intouch) |\n[Vodafone](https://www.vodafone.co.uk/explore/network/network-improvements/wi-\nfi-calling/) | [O2](https://www.o2.co.uk/connectivity/wifi-and-4g-calling).\n\n### Network perks and benefits\n\nEach network also offers some perks to entice you and we’ve listed some of\nthem below:\n\n**Three**\n\nGo Binge is available on select Three contracts and lets you stream as much as\nyou want from a select number of services, and these won’t count against your\ndata allowance. Services include Netflix, Apple Music and Deezer (you can see\nthe full list [here](http://www.three.co.uk/go-binge)). This is great if\nyou’re a Netflix binger as you won’t have to worry about how much data you’re\nusing. Three also offers ‘Feel at Home’ roaming in 71 countries, letting you\nuse your allowance while abroad.\n\n**EE**\n\nEE customers can get three months of free BT Sports on their mobile letting\nyou watch a wide range of sports including football and rugby. There’s also\nsix months of free Apple Music for pay monthly subscribers.\n\nEE also supports Wi-Fi calling, so if your phone also has that function, you\ncan make regular calls through an internet connection. Perfect if you ever\nhave patchy network coverage. If you live in London, you also get Wi-Fi on the\nLondon Underground.\n\n**Vodafone**\n\nCertain Vodafone Red Entertainment plans give you 24 months of Spotify\nPremium, Sky Sports Mobile, Now TV or Prime Video. The latter is a new\naddition to Red Entertainment’s stable. Some of these services are quite\ncostly, so it’s worth factoring these in when making a choice.\n\nVodafone has recently announced an expansion to its roaming on Red\nEntertainment plans, called Global Roaming Plus, adding an additional 29\ndestinations. This brings its total to 77 countries worldwide where you can\nuse your Vodafone contract without additional charge. There are also an\nadditional 75 ‘Roam-further’ destinations where you can pay from £6 a day for\nservice abroad.\n\nGlobal Roaming Plus is available to new and upgrading Vodafone customers from\nSeptember 4th. The original 48 Roam-free destinations can be found\n[here](https://www.vodafone.co.uk/cs/groups/public/documents/webcontent/vfcon079682.pdf).\n\nThe newly added destinations include: Albania, Anguilla, Antigua, Aruba,\nAustralia, Barbados, Bermuda, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Canada, Cayman Islands,\nDominica, Ghana, Grenada, Jamaica, Kenya, Lesotho, Mexico, Monsterrat,\nMozambique, Netherland Antilles, New Zealand, South Africa, St Kitts and\nNevis, St Vincent, St Lucia, Trinidad & Tobago, Turks and Caicos, UK Virgin\nIslands, USA.\n\n**O2**\n\nO2 gives you O2 Priority, which can give you early access to tickets to gigs\nand shows and exclusive offers for O2 customers. O2 also provides free access\nto certain public Wi-Fi networks across the UK for its customers. O2 has also\nannounced it’s adding more countries to its list of supported roaming\ndestinations, taking the total to 75 countries.\n\n**iD Mobile**\n\niD Mobile has the perk of data rollover. This means any data you don’t use\nfrom your month’s allowance is added to the next month’s. This gives you a\nsecond chance to use it, so it doesn’t go to waste.\n\n### Keep your old phone number\n\nGone are the days of messaging everyone in your phone book to tell them you\nhave a new phone number. Even if you change network providers, you can keep\nyour old phone number.\n\nTo port your old number between providers, you’ll need to contact your old\nprovider and ask for something called a PAC code. This stands for Port\nAuthorising Code. Once you have this, just contact your new provider and they\ncan handle the transfer of your number. This usually takes about 24 hours.\n\nYou usually have 30 days to give your new provider the PAC code, as they tend\nto expire after this period. Fear not, you can always request a new PAC.\n\n_We may earn a commission if you click a deal and buy an item.
