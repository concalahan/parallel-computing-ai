It was unveileved back in September as the first to include built-in\naudio, thanks to a pair of integrated headphones.\n\nWhen the VR company announced the new model it claimed it was now working as\nhard on the audio experience as the video and promised further details on the\nnew sonic skills in the ‘coming months.’ These appear to be those details.\n\nDespite appearing at CES, Oculus is still staying mum about a potential\nconsumer release date for the pioneering VR headset. Most observers expect it\nto land in time for the holidays, but it is yet to be confirmed.\n\nCEO Brendan Ibe told [The\nVerge](http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/6/7504099/oculus-rift-audio-sdk-\nces-2015) the firm is attempting to confirm some aspects of the final design\nin order to get the manufacturing supply chain in place, so perhaps we can\nexpect some news soon.\n\n"}
