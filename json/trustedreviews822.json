When the Xbox One launched it had a heavy\nfocus on the use of Microsoft’s own Cortana assistant which can be used to do\neverything from launch games to take screenshots.\n\n**Related:[Best Xbox One Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-xbox-\none-games-3435271)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nImage Credit: Windows Central\n\n## Exact functionality remains unclear\n\nTo our mind, the console’s voice assistant support could take two forms.\nEither Alexa or Google Assistant could be packed directly into the console,\nallowing you to access their functionality without the need for external\nhardware, or else the idea could be that you use your existing smart speaker\nhardware to control the console.\n\nOf the two we think the latter is most likely, and we think it could be a very\ngood thing for the console. Our favourite aspect of the console’s Cortana\nsupport was being able to launch a game with our voice without having to pick\nup a controller, so being able to do this same thing with our Amazon or Google\nhardware would be a great piece of functionality.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nWe’ll have to wait for an official confirmation from Microsoft before we know\nexactly what the functionality will entail, but with [E3\n2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/e3-2018-2949170) just around the\ncorner, an announcement could be on the way very shortly.\n\n**Would you use Alexa to control your Xbox console?
