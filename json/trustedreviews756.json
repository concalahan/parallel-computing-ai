The only five watches that won’t be getting the update are the LG G\nWatch, Samsung Gear Live, Moto 360 (2014), Sony Smartwatch 3 and the first\nAsus ZenWatch.\n\nThe update comes at a time when Apple is poised to extend its vast lead in the\nsmartwatch market thanks to the Apple Watch Series 4. Google’s best shot at a\ncomeback lies with the Qualcomm Wear 3100 processor, which promises a\nsignificant improvement in battery life.\n\n**Can this update help Google reel in the Apple Watch?
