As a general rule, the more you’reable to pay upfront, the less you’re going to be paying over the life of yourcontract, which is typically 24 months.To calculate your total cost of ownership (TCO), you simply need to multiplythe monthly cost by your contract duration, and then add the upfront cost.So, for a theoretical contract of £100 upfront, £30 a month for 24 months youwould use the following:(24 x £30) + £100 = £820It’s then worth looking at what the current SIM free cost of the phone youwant, which will help give you an idea of how much you’re spending on youractual mobile service. If you shop around, you can find that you’re actuallypaying very little for your phone tariff.### Work out how much data you needNowadays, the biggest commodity when it comes to a mobile phone contract isthe data, whereas in the past people might have looked at how many minutes andtexts they got as part of their package. Today, most contracts will give youmore call minutes and text messages than you’ll ever need, so don’t be easilywon over by thousands of minutes or even ‘unlimited’. The networks know you’renever going to use them, so they can aim for the stars.Most of us browse social media and the web, and stream music and video fromour phones. These all require data. While browsing web pages and Instagramwon’t use that much data, streaming video is the biggest user of data. So ifyou’re planning on streaming lots of Netflix on the move, you’ll want to optfor a plan that has more data. Moderate users should still get by with around8GB, but if you’re a particularly heavy user look for double digits.Similarly, if you plan on tethering a second device, you’ll want more data.You can use your phone as a mobile hotspot, letting you share your dataconnection with other devices like tablets or laptops. Great for when you’reaway from Wi-Fi and need to get online. But doing this can burn through yourdata allowance rapidly. So go for a higher data package if this is you.Finally, compare packages. A lot of high data packages have exactly the samecost as lower data packages if you’re paying attention. There’s no reason notto go for the higher data package just in case you find yourself wanting thatextra data.### How to choose the right mobile networkEven if you’re pretty sure which network you’d like to go with when youupgrade, it’s always worth finding out what else the main networks areoffering as part of their mobile contracts.
