Making Spidey control like a sports car in\nthree dimensions is the game’s crowning achievement, and you feel it while\nplowing through the city, and in every combat encounter.\n\nSwing. Punch. Dodge. Every one of these actions sees Spider-Man’s entire body\ncascading through the air with tremendous momentum, which at first merely look\nlike great animations, but later becomes something you can _feel_ as you play.\nAt top speed, Marvel’s Spider-Man is one of the best action brawlers of the\nyear, rivalling even Rocksteady’s Batman series for the open-world superhero\ncrown. However, too often it’s bogged down by its own ideas with forced\nstealth sequences and a few too many ideas that aren’t quite developed to\ncompletion. It’s when the pace dips that these problems become apparent.\n\nMarvel’s Spider-Man is the game, narratively, that comic fans have been\ncraving for decades. It’s been several years since Peter Parker first put on\nhis tights, and the webhead is confident in his abilities, whizzing around the\ncity with ease.\n\nHell, within the first ten minutes you are shown NYPD cops who trust Spider-\nMan, informed of the rogue’s gallery Spider-Man has already put away and\nyou’re climbing Fisk’s skyscraper to bring him down. This isn’t a trick, the\nend of these first few sequences have you fighting Fisk and turning him over\nto the police.\n\n**Related:[Best PS4\nGames](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/ps4-games-3431751)**\n\n![spider man\n](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nMeanwhile, J Jonah Jameson has graduated from his well-known role as the\neditor and publisher on newspaper The Daily Bugle and is now an Alex Jones-\nesque truther, spouting nonsensical half-truths about Spider-Man on a podcast,\nwhere the mere mention of the webhead is enough to send him into a foaming\nrant.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Bang & Olufsen announces Bronze Collection of multiroom speakers\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/bo-bronze-collection-3613043 \"Bang &\nOlufsen announces Bronze Collection of multiroom speakers\")\n\n  * [ ![OnePlus 6T head on](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### The OnePlus 6T might soon be available from Three\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/three-uk-oneplus-3613430 \"The OnePlus 6T\nmight soon be available from Three\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Google Home](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Google Home Black Friday Deals: What to expect and deals live now\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/google-home-black-friday-3333404\n\"Google Home Black Friday Deals: What to expect and deals live now\")\n\n  * \n\nSpider-Man and his presence are established here. I immediately felt at home,\nexploring a world made up of chunks of our hero’s comic history, blended with\na mix of deep cut locations like Josie’s Bar and big Marvel Cinematic Universe\nlocations like the Strange Sanctorum and the Avengers Tower.\n\nIt doesn’t draw in too much of Spider-Man’s rogue gallery throughout the 20\nhours of story, but it’s an entertaining comic book yarn, with plenty of\nsurprises, the now comic-book standard post-credits scene (there are two, by\nthe way) and an ending that leaves me looking forward to see what else\nInsomniac have planned for the universe.\n\nTonally, the game is enjoyably light, only dipping into a darker tone a few\ntimes during the game. The change can be jarring; it’s tonally a little odd to\nsee our wisecracking hero at the helm and watching a terrorist atrocity.\n\nThe game works best as a light-hearted superhero romp, and I enjoyed the\nentire narrative from the slightly plodding opening hours to a taut final\nthird. You can probably guess several of the plot points before they come to\npass, but the story reaches them with gusto.\n\n**Related:[Upcoming PS4 Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/upcoming-\nps4-games-3530401)**\n\n![spider\nman](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nPeter, and by extension Spider-Man, have the same problems that we do. His\nrent is too expensive, he’s never on time for anything and he’s in an awkward\nrelationship with his ex where even a simple text conversation is fraught with\nmisunderstandings and anxiety. He’s human, and his interactions, quips and\nworries imbue the entire game with charm.\n\nThe best Peter Parker is one who is comfortable with his place in the world\nbut struggling to make everything work, and it’s great to see him here: it\nhumanises him as we go through an increasingly fantastical narrative. That’s\nimportant because with comic book heroes it’s never just about the hero, but\nthe person wearing the spandex.\n\nHowever, it’s when the game puts you in the shoes of regular civilians that\nthings start to chug. The game has several playable characters, dropping you\ninto them at different times to make you feel powerless. Often, this means a\nregrettable stealth segment, but it’s used to strong effect here in the\naftermath of a brutal attack that caps off the first half, with players dumped\ninto the shoes of a civilian trying to escape the atrocity.\n\nWhile a couple of stealth segments are well done, mostly it just involves the\nplayer as Mary Jane skulking around behind cardboard boxes and soldiering on\nuntil the game lets you control Spidey again. Later, these stealth segments\ngive you extra options, whether that involves distracting enemies with\nhacking, gadgets or even just getting Spider-Man to descend from the roof to\nbattle your enemies. Thing is, watching Spider-Man do his thing isn’t as cool\nas getting to do it yourself.\n\nTalking of cool stuff, combat in the game takes advantage of Spider-Man’s\nagility, letting you dodge and weave, taking enemies into the sky to pummel\nthem, or sliding through their legs to leather them in the spine. Combat works\nbest when you’re in the thick of it, hurtling enemies against each other and\ntossing gadgets — ranging through impact webbing to electric webs and\nconcussive blasts — into the fray to try and carve yourself some breathing\nspace.\n\n**Related:[Best PSVR Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/psvr-\ngames-3523296)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nWebs are one of the most unique aspects, and they form the backbone of the\ngame’s combat. After dodging an enemy, you can hit them in the back with\nimpact webbing, sending them flying into a wall, trapped against it. Many of\nyour fights will end with your enemies webbed to walls, ceilings, hanging\nupside down on the side of a city bus or the underside of a bridge.\n\nThere’s something uniquely Spider-Man about the whole thing, and it never\nfails to put a smile on my face when you throw a webbed up enemy off of a\nroof, and later find them stuck to the side of the building opposite, safe in\ntheir webby cocoon.\n\nBecause combat is so heavily influenced by the world around you, each fight\nfeels fairly unique even if the building blocks are the same. Once you’ve\nfought in one alleyway, you’ve fought in them all, but there’s a pleasing\nvariation to the fights that make them a joy to replay, which is a plus\nbecause you’re going to be knocking around a whole lot of goons over the\ncourse of the game.\n\nStealth plays a big part too, but the similarities to Batman’s Arkham Series\nmean it’s almost not worth going into detail. You flit around from perch to\nperch, hanging enemies up by their feet using your webs, or taking them out\nfrom afar with your gadgets. Here too, webbing up your enemies adds a unique\nelement, but the stealth isn’t as well done here as in Batman, but the\nmechanics feel remarkably similar, which isn’t a great look when you consider\nthe age of the game that it’s aping. Still, it’s Spider-Man, and it looks\ngreat, it’s just that stealth isn’t a particularly interesting option,\ncompared to punching.\n\nWhat Marvel’s Spider-Man does best is movement and I adore it. The swinging.\nThe neat little web-zip you do to keep altitude. The giant jump you can pull\noff after you hit the ground and roll. This is Spider-Man’s city, and with\nsome practice, it’ll be your city. Learning to get around is a treat, and when\nyou master all of the overlapping systems, just traveling is a rewarding\nexperience. About a third of the way into the game, a fast-travel system opens\nup. I used it twice.\n\n**Related:[Fallout 76](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/fallout-76-news-\nrelease-date-gameplay-3479330)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nWhatever your playstyle there are a wealth of additional costumes for Spider-\nMan on offer, and in addition to some tremendous fan-service — hi, Scarlet\nSpider — they offer unique abilities to help you with things like traversal,\ncombat or even just restocking your gadgets on the fly. The powers can make\nyour fights feel like a real comic book experience, letting you become\nimpervious to harm, deflect bullets back at your attackers, or letting out a\nburst of EMP to stun enemies and disable their weapons. I used several\ndifferent abilities during my time with the game, and once you unlock the suit\nthey ship with, you can use whichever works best for you, giving you a lot of\nfreedom to play however you want.\n\n## **Verdict**\n\nMarvel’s Spider-Man has a surprising amount to say for itself and continues\nSony’s run of best-in-show first party exclusives. Comic book fans will fall\nin love with Insomniac’s loving rendition of the webhead’s Manhattan, but fans\nexpecting the next God of War might find themselves a little disappointed.\n\nStill, there’s a lot to enjoy here. It’s uncomplicated fun, and it should\ndeliver fun evenings defeating Spidey’s Rogue’s Gallery, exploring the city or\neven just pelting around at high speed hoovering up collectibles.\n\n## Score\n\n  \n\n"}
