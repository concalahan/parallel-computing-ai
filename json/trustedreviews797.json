Here's everything you need to know about\nApple's next-generation streaming tech.\n\nAt WWDC 2017, Apple teased AirPlay 2 – the update to Apple’s longstanding\nstreaming protocol. Now, a whole year later, it has finally rolled out as part\nof the the iOS 11.4 update. That was some wait.\n\nBut what is AirPlay 2 and should you care? And how do you get it? We’ve pulled\ntogether everything you need to know about AirPlay 2 below.\n\n## **What is AirPlay 2?**\n\nAirPlay 2 is the second generation of Apple’s proprietary wireless streaming\ntech, which comes built into all of its hardware products.\n\nIt’s designed to throw content from your iDevice – often music, but it also\nworks with video and photos – to a compatible receiver over your Wi-Fi\nnetwork, be that a wireless speaker or [Apple\nTV](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/apple-tv).\n\nOriginally released in 2010 as part of iOS 4, an update was long overdue,\nwhich is exactly what AirPlay 2 aims to deliver.\n\nWhile it retains the media capabilities of the original AirPlay, AirPlay 2 now\nadds extra functionality, allowing you to stream multiroom audio to any\ncompatible speaker, as well as set up two [Apple\nHomePod](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/apple-homepod) speakers in\nstereo.\n\n**Related:[Best headphones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nheadphones-3449433)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n![HomePod multiroom\nAirplay](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## **Airplay 2 – new features**\n\nArguably the biggest addition in AirPlay 2 is multiroom functionality.\n\nIt’s a refreshing move from Apple, since it isn’t limited to just the\ncompany’s products. Any AirPlay 2-compatible speaker, such as the [Sonos\nBeam](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sonos-beam) or the [Naim Mu-\nSo](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/naim-audio-mu-so), will work\nhappily in a multiroom setup alongside the Apple HomePod, for example.\n\nUse Apple’s Home app to name your speakers (“Bedroom”, “Kitchen”, and so on),\nafter which you’ll be able to select the AirPlay icon within your music app of\nchoice, group speakers together from the pop-up AirPlay menu, and then adjust\nthe volume of each one individually from the Control Centre.\n\nThe only sticking point is that unless you’re an [Apple\nMusic](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/apple-music) subscriber, you’re\nlimited to playing the same music across all speakers. It isn’t as flexible as\na more dedicated multiroom solution, such as\n[Sonos](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/sonos-deals-3281985).\n\nIf you _are_ an Apple Music subscriber, then rather than digging through pages\nof menus, you can leave it to Siri to make your musical dreams a reality. Why\nnot ask her to play AC/DC in the lounge, and Taylor Swift in the kitchen?\n\n**Related:[Best Bluetooth\nspeakers](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/bluetooth-speakers-3431819)**\n\n![HomePod Stereo pairing\napp](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## **Airplay 2 – What else can it do?**\n\nFor HomePod users with enough disposable cash to splash out on more than one\nunit, AirPlay 2 also introduces the ability to hook up two speakers in stereo.\n\nThis is once again achieved through the Home app. Simply click one speaker,\nselect the option to set it up as a stereo pair and then pick the second\nHomePod as its pairing mate.\n\nFrom here, they’ll perform as a single speaker, with one receiving the left\naudio channel, and the other receiving the right, for a more traditional hi-fi\nexperience.\n\nThankfully, Siri will only respond to requests through one, to save you being\ndeafened by booming weather updates in stereo.\n\nIf you want to use your second HomePod in another room, rather than as part of\na duo, you can unpair the devices in the Home app as quickly as you paired\nthem. They’ll simply revert back to individual mono speakers.\n\nFinally, Apple TV users can also benefit from a little AirPlay 2 hack, in that\nany speaker or soundbar connected to a compatible Apple TV will become an\nAirPlay 2 speaker by default. Pretty neat.\n\n**Related:[Spotify vs Apple\nMusic](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/spotify-vs-apple-music-best-\nstreaming-service-2913394)**\n\n![apple\nhomepod](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## **What devices support AirPlay 2?**\n\nWhen it comes to compatible Apple kit, your device will need to be running iOS\n11.4 (or tvOS 11.4, in the case of Apple TV) in order to use AirPlay 2.\n\nThat means the any iPhone from the 5S and above will work, as will most iPad\nmodels from the mini 2 onwards.\n\nApple iPod and Apple TV owners won’t get quite as much flexibility – they’re\ncompatible from 6th-gen and 4th-gen respectively, so from around 2015. While\nmost Mac, iMac and MacBook models from around 2010 onwards will be fine.\n\nAs for third-party kit, Apple has published a [full list of compatible\nspeakers](https://www.apple.com/ios/home/accessories/) on its website, with\nmanufacturers including Bang & Olufsen, Naim, Sonos, Libratone and Bowers &\nWilkins all supporting it in current or forthcoming speakers.\n\n![Airplay\n2](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\n## **Will my old kit be upgradable to AirPlay 2?**\n\nMaybe. If you see your speaker on the compatible products list on Apple’s\nwebsite, an update to AirPlay 2 is incoming. Most are rolling out within the\nnext couple of months, so you might not see anything new just yet.\n\nLibratone, for example, has confirmed its\n[Zipp](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/libratone-zipp-nordic-black) and\nZipp Mini products will be upgradable to AirPlay 2 from September. An update\nfor Sonos products is coming in late July, while B&O is expected to roll out\nnew software in August.\n\nOlder Bowers & Wilkins speakers, on the other hand, won’t be so lucky.\nAlthough the manufacturer has said future products will work with AirPlay 2,\ndevices such as its popular [B&W Zeppelin\nWireless](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/bowers-wilkins-zeppelin-\nwireless) speaker will stay firmly rooted in the past.\n\nOriginal AirPlay will continue to work as before, however, so there’s not too\nmuch worry for older products – you just won’t be able to take advantage of\nthe newer features.\n\n## **When can I get AirPlay 2?**\n\nAirPlay 2 is available now on all compatible Apple devices with iOS 11.4\ninstalled – but as mentioned above, the wait for it to roll out on third-party\nspeakers might be a little longer. You’ll need to check with the\nmanufacturer’s directly for details.\n\nFeeling impatient? HomePods are of course all up to date and ready to go,\nmeaning you can take advantage of all the AirPlay 2 goodness immediately.\n\n"}
