Sounds a bit boring, but it could make all the difference when\ntrying to find the enemy taking cover in a ditch.\n\nThe Ultra HD edition of the Acer Nitro XV273K monitor will cost €1049 once it\nships towards the end of this year.  \n\nAnd if your budget can’t stretch to 4K, there are two WQHD (Wide Quad HD)\nconfigurations available instead, with one having an IPS (In Panel Switching)\nscreen that has wide viewing angles, and the other toting a TN (Twisted\nNematic) screen that prioritises brightness and power efficiency.\n\nThe former will cost €599/$499 and the latter €529/$449. We’re yet to be told\nabout UK prices, but will be sure to update this article once we’re given one.\n\n## **Predator Thronos Gaming Chair**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIf simple monitors aren’t enough to fully immerse you, then take a look at\nthis gaming chair. With room for three 27-inch monitors overhead, sitting on\nthe Predator Thronos will likely feel like being in a cockpit, with vibrations\nadding even more realism to every punch, kick and crash.\n\nAllowing you to maximise comfort, the Thronos chair is adjustable, able to\nrecline up to 140 degrees and even features a footrest.\n\nAcer has yet to reveal any details regarding price or release date, but expect\nit to be extremely pricey – and that’s before you’ve bought the monitors to\nhook it up to.\n\n**Do any of these cool accessories tickle your fancy?
