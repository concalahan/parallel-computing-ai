Perhaps it’s a new breed of voice-controlled connected\nspeaker or perhaps even specs with built-in headphones?\n\nThere are more clues within the other job listings. There’s a [product manager\nposition](https://www.spotify.com/us/jobs/view/oPi84fw3/) available where the\nsuccessful candidate will be working with “major external platform providers\nwithin the voice space.”\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nMeanwhile another product manager will be working on teams “dedicated to\nbuilding the components of the Spotify conversational interface.”\n\nWhile there’s no guarantee the latter two positions involve working on the\nhardware project, there’s at least a hint Spotify is taking voice commands\nmore seriously.\n\n**What do you think Spotify is up to?
