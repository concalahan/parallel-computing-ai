It comes enclosed in an ultra-rugged case out of\nthe box, protecting the handset from extreme temperatures, salt water and\nthermal shock.\n\nWhat’s more, the Explorer has a slew of neat software features that the\naverage outdoorsman is bound to find useful, like detailed topographic mapping\noptions from ViewRanger with an Augmented Reality Skyline feature and instant\naccess to a dashboard that includes weather information, sensor data and an\nSOS light toggle.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n“This is the smartphone we’d all like to own – a perfect combination of design\nand functionality that embodies the Land Rover DNA and enables customers to be\noutdoors for longer, with the confidence to go further,” said Joe Sinclair,\nDirector of Branded Goods at Land Rover, in a statement on the firm’s digital\n[newsroom](https://media.landrover.com/en-gb/news/2018/02/phone-thats-tough-\nland-rover).\n\nThere’s also a number of add-ons that can be used to extend the functionality\nof the Explorer, including an Adventure Pack, Battery Pack and Bike Pack – all\nof which are outlined below. And those looking to pair the unit with their\nLand Rover, or even high-end [Range\nRover](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/range-rover-velar-2017-price-\nrelease-date-specs-features-preview-3068648), can take advantage of various\nin-car applications.\n\n**Adventure Pack**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n  * 3600mAh additional battery\n  * 25 x 25mm ceramic patch GPS antenna\n  * TPU protective case\n  * Stainless steel carabiner with canvas strap\n  * IP68 and 1.8-metre drop tested\n\n**Battery Pack**\n\n  * Bike mount and case for both stem and handlebar\n  * Tilt to adjust viewing angle or change device orientation\n\n**Bike Pack**\n\n  * Ultimate battery performance, additional 4,370 mAh of battery capacity\n  * IP68 and 1.8-metre drop tested\n\nThe Land Rover Explore with Adventure Pack will cost £599 when it hits the\nshelves in the United Kingdom – though there’s no word on when that will be.\nWe’ve had a chance to go hands-on with this ruggedised adventure phone at MWC\n2018 and you can see our early thoughts below.\n\n**Related:[MWC 2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/mwc-2018-news-\nrumours-dates-preview-barcelona-3372243)**\n\n### First impressions from Richard Easton at MWC 2018\n\nThe adventure-proof credentials of the Land Rover Explore were centre stage at\nthe MWC stand. Not only were Land Rover Explore phones being subjected to a\nconstant torrent of water, but display models were being baked under a heat\nlamp and chilled under an air conditioner. All to prove that the Explore won’t\nmiss a beat regardless of what exploits you might put it through.\n\n![Land Rover\nExplore](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nA Bullit Group rep told me the phone could withstand being dropped from around\n1.8 metres, but unfortunately there was no display model being thrown around.\nThe Explore certainly feels like a phone that’s built to withstand a few\nknocks, however. It feels robust in your hands with plenty of grip.\nUnsurprisingly, it feels rather chunky to give it that needed resilience.\n\n![Land Rover\nExplore](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSlightly disappointingly, the Explore is still running Android 7.0, but an\nupdate is supposedly on the horizon. Bullit Group has provided a few\ncustomisations in the form of its Outdoor Dashboard, so you always know what\nconditions you might be facing. For sports enthusiasts, this could be snow\nconditions or wind direction.\n\n![Land Rover\nExplore](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe add-ons feel very much like Moto Mods and are going to add quite a bit of\nheft to the device. But that’s the trade-off if you want the more accurate GPS\nor extended battery life. These just snap onto the back with magnets.\n\n![Land Rover\nExplore](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAll-in-all, the Land Rover Explore could be a smartphone worth considering if\nyou prioritise ruggedness above all else. Either that or you’re particularly\nfond of Land Rover.\n\n**Have you been patiently waiting for a rugged smartphone like the Land Rover\nExplore?
