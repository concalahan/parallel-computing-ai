Here’s everything you need to know about the deal,\nincluding why Amazon is buying Whole Foods, analysis, what the buyout means\nfor grocery stores globally, and how Amazon’s share price has been affected.**\n\n## Amazon Whole Foods Deal: What do we know so far?\n\nOn Friday, June 16, Amazon Inc. confirmed that it would pay an incredible\n$13.7 billion USD (£10.7 billion) to purchase Whole Foods Market Inc.\n\nThe deal, which is Amazon’s biggest buyout ever, will see the company pay $42\nin cash per share of Whole Foods.\n\nIt has also been confirmed that John Mackey, the co-founder and CEO of Whole\nFoods, will continue to run the business.\n\nThe deal trumps Amazon’s previous biggest acquisition, when the retail giant\nbought out Twitch Interactive Inc. for $970 million in cash back in 2014.\n\nIn a press release, Amazon explains the next steps for the acquisition:\n“Completion of the transaction is subject to approval by Whole Foods Market’s\nshareholders, regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. The\nparties expect to close the transaction during the second half of 2017.”\n\n![jeff\nbezos](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)_Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos says “millions of people love\nWhole Foods” and Amazon “wants that to continue” (via Wikimedia Commons)_\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n## What is Whole Foods? Locations, employees, market cap, value and…South Park  \n\nWhole Foods Market Inc. is a major US-based supermarket chain that operates\nacross 431 locations through the USA, Canada, and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe company opened back in 1980 in Austin Texas, and now has 91,000 employees\nglobally.\n\nWhole Foods is currently publicly traded on the NASDAQ, and became a Fortune\n500 company in 2005. It’s also the 30th largest retailer in the United States,\nbased on 2014 revenue.\n\nAt the time of writing, Whole Foods Market Inc.’s market capitalisation is\n$12.53 billion. That’s the value of a single share combined by the total\nnumber of shares issued – just one way of gauging the financial worth of a\ncompany.\n\nWhole Foods was also very famously parodied in the animated TV series South\nPark. Here’s a clip:\n\n## Why is Amazon buying Whole Foods? Analysis and official statement from CEO\nJeff Bezos  \n\nIt’s not exactly clear what Amazon’s plans for Whole Foods are just yet. In a\nfrustratingly vague statement, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said: “Millions of people\nlove Whole Foods Market because they offer the best natural and organic foods,\nand they make it fun to eat healthy.”\n\nBezos continued: “Whole Foods Market has been satisfying, delighting and\nnourishing customers for nearly four decades – they’re doing an amazing job\nand we want that to continue.”\n\nWhole Foods CEO John Mackey is similarly opaque: “This partnership presents an\nopportunity to maximize value for Whole Foods Market’s shareholders, while at\nthe same time extending our mission and bringing the highest quality,\nexperience, convenience and innovation to our customers.”\n\nThe obvious connection is with AmazonFresh, a subsidiary of Amazon that\noperates a grocery delivery services through the USA and UK. The service is\nonly currently available in select locations in those two countries, so by\nbuying Whole Foods, Amazon could be making a serious play to dominate the\ngrocery market in areas where Whole Foods currently operates.\n\n![amazonfresh](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)_Amazon may want to use Whole Foods as an easy way\nto expand its existing AmazonFresh grocery delivery service (via Flickr)_\n\nSpeaking to Bloomberg, Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said:\n“Amazon clearly wants to be in grocery, clearly believes a physical presence\ngives them an advantage. I assume the physical presence gives them the ability\nto distribute other products more locally. So theoretically you could get\n5-minute delivery.”\n\nAmazon has also shown great interest in brick-and-mortar retail – despite\nhaving built almost all of its retail empire through online channels – with\nthe launch of Amazon Go.\n\nIn October last year, the company announced plans to build Amazon Go\nconvenience stores that would operate on an automatic system that didn’t\nrequire physical staff. The first such store opened to Amazon employees back\nin December, and a store designed for use by the general public is expected to\nopen later this year.\n\nBy purchasing Whole Foods, Amazon may be hoping to rollout this autonomous\nshopping experience across existing Whole Foods stores – although such a move\nhasn’t been officially confirmed. However, the decision would make sense as a\ncost-saving ploy in terms of reducing the need for staff, and would also mean\nAmazon wouldn’t need to invest further in retail locations, as WSJ Financial\nEditor Dennis K. Berman neatly outlines:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/statuses/875701677504024576\n\nAnd if all of the above is wrong, our in-house video producer Tom Honeyands\nhas his own crackpot theory that might just be on the money:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/statuses/875708311127166976\n\n## How will Amazon’s Whole Foods acquisition affect grocery stores?\n\nWhatever Amazon’s reason for buying out Whole Foods, it’s clear that\nsupermarkets across the UK and USA will be feeling very nervous right now.\n\nAmazon’s sweeping dominance online has left the firm with very well-padded\ncoffers, and now the company will have overwhelming access on a brick-and-\nmortar level too. If Amazon can successfully reproduce its rapid delivery\nsystem that it uses for general goods for grocery shipping and retail, it\ncould cause major problems for food giants like Walmart and Tesco.\n\nIn a statement sent to _TrustedReviews_ , Maria Prados, VP of Global Retail\nand eCommerce at Worldpay, said: “Amazon’s move to buy Whole Foods is a clear\nsign of its intention to disrupt the grocery industry globally. From the\n“Dash” buy button, to the launch of the AmazonFresh service last year, the\neCommerce giant has been taking clear steps to build its position in the\ngrocery sector. And investing in a physical presence could be the key to\nAmazon’s success in this space.”\n\n“With one in ten Brits now doing all their grocery shopping online, it is now\neasier than ever to buy household necessities from the comfort of our sofa,”\nshe continued.\n\nPrados added: “We have reached a tipping point in the evolution of the UK\ngrocery market, and it will be interesting to see whether Amazon will continue\nto focus on their culture of convenience and reliability, or whether they will\nend up creating a whole new online shopping experience, taking the chore out\nof the weekly shop.”\n\n![whole\nfoods](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)_Whole Foods Market in the Lower East Side of New\nYork (via Wikimedia Commons)_\n\nSpeaking to Reuters, Jan Rogers Kniffen, Chief Executive of retail consultancy\nJ. Rogers Kniffen WWE in New York, said: “I think that I would not like to be\nsomebody playing in the grocery space right now.”\n\n“Whole Foods has given up a lot of market share because they didn’t capitalize\non being the leader in organic, but they still have a footprint,” he\ncontinued. “It’s a little different when you’re Amazon. Whole Foods has to\nmake money, Amazon doesn’t have to make money. All Amazon’s got to is grow.\nAnd now they’ve got a platform for doing that!”\n\nKniffen closed: “I think we’ll see very aggressive pricing out of Amazon in\ngrocery, which will include the Whole Foods component.”\n\n## Amazon Share Price: How has Whole Foods buyout affect Amazon stock?\n\nUnsurprisingly, this acquisition has improved Amazon’s share price, which is\nup 2.62% to $989.46 USD per share today, as recorded at the time of writing.\nHowever, it’s still below the firm’s year high of $1,011.34 per share.\n\nThe company’s market capitalisation is now $466.55 billion, which means it\ncurrently ranks as the fourth most valuable company in the world, behind Apple\nInc., Alphabet (Google’s parent company), and Microsoft.\n\n**Related:[Best Alexa skills](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-\nskills-amazon-echo)**\n\n**Do you think Amazon buying Whole Foods is sensible?
