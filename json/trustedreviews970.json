Switch Online will cost £20 (and\n$20) for the year, and a little under £4 per month if that is your preferred\nway to pay.\n\n**Related:[Fortnite Weekly Challenges\nGuide](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/fortnite-weekly-challenges-guide-\nseason-5-3564952)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThis is a boon for Fortnite, allowing players to continue to enjoy the title.\nSony seems to have a similar deal, with players able to play the PlayStation 4\nversion of the title without a valid PlayStation Plus subscription. Nintendo\nhas hinted at other games that will duck the subscription requirement, but as\nof yet only Fortnite has been singled out.\n\n**Are you a Fortnite player happy to avoid picking up a Switch Online\nmembership, or salty that you won’t be able to play Smash Bros without forking\nout a little extra?
