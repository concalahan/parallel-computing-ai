Environments are vast,\nproviding the player with multiple avenues of exploration, although you’ll\nneed certain abilities to reach specific areas without any trouble.\n\nNew abilities will be obtained as you progress, granting Ori access to areas\npreviously impossible to reach. Skills can also be upgraded, providing you\nwith an advantage in battle and manoeuvrability while opening up the game\nworld as a consequence.\n\nThe original game was very challenging at times, and hopefully, that is\nretained in Will of the Wisps. At the same time, a difficulty setting that\nallows new players to enjoy the story without too much resistance would also\nbe welcome.\n\n## Ori and the Will of the Wisps trailer – how does it look?\n\nAt E3 2018 we were treated to a brand new gameplay trailer for the game, which\nshows off much of the game georgious visuals that were introduced with the\n[debut trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kPSl2vyu2Y) shown during the\n2017 conference.\n\n**Are you excited for Ori’s next adventure?
