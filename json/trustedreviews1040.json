So, which should you buy?\n\nIn this versus we’ll take a look at the differences between the two devices so\nyou can determine which phone fits your needs better.\n\n## **Samsung Galaxy S9 vs S9 Plus specs – Which is faster?**\n\nFor the second year in a row, Samsung’s smaller device doesn’t come with many\nperformance compromises over its bigger sibling.\n\nBoth phones are powered by the same[ Snapdragon\n845](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/snapdragon-845-benchmark-phones-\nspeed-3390981) mobile platform – Qualcomm’s latest chip that’s built using the\nsame ultra-efficient 10nm process as the 835. If you’re in Europe, your S9/S9\nPlus will be powered by Samsung’s own Exynos 9810 chip, but there really isn’t\nmuch difference between the two.\n\n### The Top Samsung Galaxy S9 Deals Right Now\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=422&clickref=TR-\nGalaxyS9&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.e2save.com%2Fcontract%2Fsamsung%2Fsamsung-\ngalaxy-s9-black%3Ftariffcode%3DDD1YEFEB18%26giftcode%3DNA16)\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=422&clickref=TR-\nGalaxyS9&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.e2save.com%2Fcontract%2Fsamsung%2Fsamsung-\ngalaxy-s9-black%3Ftariffcode%3DDD1YEFEB18%26giftcode%3DNA16)\n\n###\n\n[Samsung Galaxy S9 – 4GB, £23pm, £100 upfront from Vodafone (use code EPICTEN\nto save £10)\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=422&clickref=TR-\nGalaxyS9&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.e2save.com%2Fcontract%2Fsamsung%2Fsamsung-\ngalaxy-s9-black%3Ftariffcode%3DDD1YEFEB18%26giftcode%3DNA16)\n\ne2save has come out with this brilliantly affordable contract for the Galaxy\nS9, made even better with a £10 discount when using the code EPICTEN.\n\n[e2save\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=422&clickref=TR-\nGalaxyS9&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.e2save.com%2Fcontract%2Fsamsung%2Fsamsung-\ngalaxy-s9-black%3Ftariffcode%3DDD1YEFEB18%26giftcode%3DNA16)\n\n|\n\n£110 upfront w/code\n\n|\n\nNow £23pm\n\n[View\nDeal](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=422&clickref=TR-\nGalaxyS9&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.e2save.com%2Fcontract%2Fsamsung%2Fsamsung-\ngalaxy-s9-black%3Ftariffcode%3DDD1YEFEB18%26giftcode%3DNA16)\n\nNow £23pm\n\n|\n\n£110 upfront w/code\n\n|\n\n[e2save\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=422&clickref=TR-\nGalaxyS9&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.e2save.com%2Fcontract%2Fsamsung%2Fsamsung-\ngalaxy-s9-black%3Ftariffcode%3DDD1YEFEB18%26giftcode%3DNA16)\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=3202&clickref=TR-\nBestMobileDeals&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fsamsung%2Fgalaxy-s9-black%3Fcontracts%3D1)\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=3202&clickref=TR-\nBestMobileDeals&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fsamsung%2Fgalaxy-s9-black%3Fcontracts%3D1)\n\n###\n\n[Samsung Galaxy S9 – 30GB, £36pm, no upfront from Vodafone\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=3202&clickref=TR-\nBestMobileDeals&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fsamsung%2Fgalaxy-s9-black%3Fcontracts%3D1)\n\n30GB of data and no upfront cost for only £36pm?

It seems odd for Samsung to\nrestrict the higher amount of RAM to the bigger phone, but during our review\nwe didn’t really notice any issues on the smaller model with the lower amount\nof RAM.\n\nArguably, the biggest difference between the two devices is the addition of a\nsecondary camera sensor on the S9 Plus – and, again, it’s a shame it’s been\nleft off the smaller phone.\n\n![Samsung Galaxy\nS9](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIt works as it does on the[ Galaxy Note\n8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-8), offering up\n2x optical zoom without sacrificing picture quality. It also enables some\nportrait modes for increasing bokeh – that silky blur you often see in\nprofessional photos. We wouldn’t recommend you opt for the Plus model for this\nfeature alone, but it’s a good additional bonus.\n\nYou’ll be happy to hear that there’s parity between both devices with regards\nto the rest of the camera. Each has a main 12-megapixel sensor featuring a\nclever mechanical aperture that moves between f/2.4 and f/1.5, depending on\nthe surrounding environment. In bright sun it will use the f/2.4 aperture; the\nwider f/1.5 will kick in when the light dims. We’ve seen such software that\nmimics variable aperture on phones before, but this is the first time there’s\na switcher in the camera.\n\nPictures shot with these two phones are excellent: sharp, colourful and\nreliable. Although not the best smartphone camera out there – that honour goes\nto the Google Pixel 2 XL – it isn’t far off. With the f/1.5 aperture in play\nresulting low-light snaps are bright, although this is at the expense of\ndetail and edges can become smudged as a result.\n\nThe camera supports 4K video shot at 60fps, plus there’s a new super slow-\nmotion trick that will shoot a burst at 960fps when it detects fast-moving\nmotion.\n\n![Samsung Galaxy\nS9](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nBoth the S9 and S9 Plus sport 8-megapixel cameras around the front, featuring\na wide f/1.7 aperture for capturing those selfies. The front cameras feature\nAR Emoji, a trick similar to Apple’s Animoji. These emoji far more resemble\ncartoon characters than typical emoji and will capture your facial\nexpressions. They’re nothing but a gimmick, however – and a cheap one at that.\n\nIn a move that will surprise no-one, the Galaxy S9 Plus includes a larger\n3500mAh battery than the Galaxy S9 (3000mAh). Even with the increased\ncapacity, you’ll get around a day of battery life from both phones – if you’re\nlucky. At least the S9 and S9 Plus offer support for Qi wireless charging,\nalong with quick-charge capabilities through the USB-C port when you use the\nright cables and plugs.\n\n**Related:**[ **Best smartphones**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nsmartphone)\n\n## **Samsung Galaxy S9 vs S9 Plus design – Do they look different?**\n\nConsidering the huge overhaul the S-series received last year, the S9 was\nunlikely to see a dramatic change. Both phones retain the curvy glass and\nmetal look with minimal bezel, the headphone jack and an IP68 rating for\nwater-resistance.\n\nThankfully, the fingerprint scanner has been moved to sit beneath the camera\nsensor. As a result, it’s easier to hit.\n\nThe Galaxy S9 Plus tips the scales at 189g, which is marginally heavier than\nthe 163g Galaxy S9. The extra screen real-estate also makes the Plus model\ntaller and more difficult to comfortably grip in one hand.\n\n![Samsung Galaxy S9\nPlus](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nBoth devices will be available in black, blue or purple at launch. Purple is\nour colour of choice.\n\n## **Samsung Galaxy S9 vs S9 Plus price – Which is better value?**\n\nThese are flagship phones and that status is represented in their price.\nNeither is cheap and there’s been an price increase over the S8 and S8 Plus.\n\n**Related:**[ **Best Samsung Galaxy S9\ndeals**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-samsung-\ngalaxy-s9-deals-3402357)\n\nThe smaller Galaxy S9 will cost £739 for the 64GB model, and the Galaxy S9\nPlus will be priced at £869. This puts the phones in similar vicinity to the\niPhone 8 and 8 Plus, but cheaper than the £999[ iPhone\nX](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-x).\n\n## **Samsung Galaxy S9 vs S9 Plus – Verdict**\n\nAside for the additional camera, there isn’t much separating the S9 and S9\nPlus – and that’s good to know. The Plus model does include extra RAM and a\nbigger battery, but in use these didn’t amount to huge bonuses.\n\nSo really the decision over which phone you choose will come down to size: do\nyou want a bigger phone with a larger screen or one that’s more compact?\nWhichever model you opt for, you can be assured that you’ll be getting a great\ndevice.\n\n**_Which Samsung flagship would you pick?
