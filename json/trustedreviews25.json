There’s a[brand new\nuser interface](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-wear-os-update-\nrelease-3594734) rolling out, a [new processor to boost battery\nlife](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/montblanc-\nsummit-2-wear-3100-price-3605353) and now the long overdue arrival of a staple\napp.**\n\nSpotify for Google’s Wear OS (v2.0 and up) is [rolling\nout](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2018-10-17/hello-wear-os-by-googletm-\nspotify-here/) as a standalone app, enabling users to stream their tunes\ndirectly from the wrist without the need for a smartphone.\n\nThe app offers easy access to playback controls, as well as support for\nSpotify Connect for beaming the music to compatible speakers. Users will also\nbe able to access their recently played content, as well as the ability to add\nsongs to a list of favourites.\n\nUnfortunately, the app is currently nigh-on useless to those outside of Wi-Fi\nrange, because it does not support Spotify’s offline playlists feature. That\nmeans users with limited data plans won’t have much leeway for streaming\nmusic.\n\n**Related:[Best smartwatch 2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nsmartwatch-3434307)**\n\nIn a statement (via [Wareable](https://www.wareable.com/android-wear/spotify-\napp-wear-os-6623)), Spotify said: “We’re excited to introduce a standalone\nSpotify app for Wear OS by Google smartwatches. This is the first version of\nthe app, and we will continue to improve the Spotify experience.”\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThat appears to suggest it will be added in the future, but at present the app\nis limited to connected streaming online. Those who’ve been patiently awaiting\nthe app will need to hang tough for now.\n\nCurrently, the Google Play Music app for Wear OS gives users the opportunity\nto download tracks for offline playback by tapping a download option next to\nalbums, playlists and radio stations within the app.\n\nThe rollout of the feature appears to be limited at present because it is not\nyet appearing on the Google Play Store. The company says it’s coming to all\nWear OS users in the coming week.\n\n**Was the Spotify app your number one demand for Wear OS? Let us know\n@TrustedRevierws on Twitter.**\n\n"}
