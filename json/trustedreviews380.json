It was a\nsurprisingly underwhelming show, coming in at 30 minutes or so with a small\nyet exciting slate of games being shown off during the presentation. Sadly, we\nsaw nothing of [Final Fantasy 7\nRemake](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/final-fantasy-7-remake-release-\ndate-2993127) or [The Avengers\nProject](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/the-avengers-square-enix-project-\nrelease-date-trailer-news-preorder-gameplay-characters-2951432).\n\n_Trusted Reviews_ has compiled everything you need to know about the Square\nEnix E3 2018 Showcase including the all the news and announcements you need to\nknow.\n\n## Square Enix E3 2018 Showcase Summary – How was it?\n\nIn a word – strange. It feels like the announcements Square Enix had yet to\nunveil during this showcase could have been part of other conferences instead\nof dedicating resources to its own. The trailers for [Kingdom Hearts\n3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/kingdom-hearts-3-release-date-2993095)\nand [Shadow of the Tomb Raider](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/shadow-of-\nthe-tomb-raider-release-date-preview-2939265) included footage we’d already\nseen, and the lack of new details left us feeling dissapointed.\n\nThat being said, the reveal of Platinum Games’ Babylon’s Fall looked\nincredibly cool, and could be the cryptic action title the studio has been\nteasing in recent months. We were also treated to extended looks of [Just\nCause 4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/just-cause-4-release-\ndate-3478275) and [Dragon Quest\n11](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/dragon-quest-11-echoes-elusive-age)\nbefore things drew to an unceremonious close. Here’s hoping\n[Sony](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-watch-sony-\nps4-e3-2018-press-conference-3471683) and\n[Ubisoft](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-watch-ubisoft-e3-press-\nconference-3480123) will pick up the slack before E3 2018 draws to a close.\n\n## Square Enix E3 2018 Showcase – Where can I watch it?  \n\n## Square Enix E3 2018 Showcase liveblog – All the news as it happened\n\n**1800:** The Showcase has begun and the president of Square Enix is here to\nintroduce a variety of new titles to explored throughout today’s stream. First\nup is Eidos Montreal’s Shadow of The Tomb Raider with a brand new trailer and\ngameplay presentation. Lara is caught up in a range of perilous escapades once\nagain in this third instalment. During this adventure she will race to stop a\nMayan apocalypse, although she’ll once again be outgunned and outnumbered.\n\n**1806:** The gameplay demo follows Lara as she creeps through a jungle\nstabbing mercenaries to her heart’s content. She could be hunting for\ntreasure, but whatever floats her boat I suppose. Either way, it looks like\nanother great entry for the series.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n**1808:** Hugely popular MMORPG Final Fantasy 14: A Realm Reborn has received\na new trailer exploring a substantial patch, adding new missions and narrative\nnuggets for hardcore fans. Known as Under the Moonlight, it will be with you\nsoon as a free update!\n\n**1810:** Final Fantasy 14 and Monster Hunter World have teamed up for an\nofficial crossover event set to debut in Summer 2018. It looks ridiculous, and\nwe really hope there’s a massive raid to be explored in all this.\n\n**1810:** DONTNOD Entertainment’s The Awesome Adventure of Captain Spirit is a\nnew entry in the Life is Strange universe, and will be available for free\nacross PS4, Xbox One and PC on June 26. It’s not Life is Strange Season 2, but\ninstead the first steps into its expanded universe.\n\n**1814:** Dragon Quest 11: Echoes of An Elusive Age is here with a new\ntrailer. The upcoming JRPG is the first to hit consoles in over a decade, and\nSquare Enix isn’t slouching when it comes to showing off its lush visuals and\nretro gameplay.\n\n**1818:** A new IP has been announced in the form of Babylon’s Fall by\nPlatinum Games. Coming to PS4 and PC in 2019, it appears to be an epic fantasy\naction experience packed with dark, gritty fantasy combat and plenty of\ndetailed lore. Check out the trailer below:\n\n**1821:** Next up is a more detailed glimpse at Avalanche Studio’s Just Cause\n4. The sandbox action title will offer the same level of chaotic ambition\nplayers expect alongside a new weather system which can have a huge influence\non movement, gunplay and other elements. Enemies now present a more\nintelligent threat to Rico with some wielding heavy weapons as others turn\ninvisible. It sounds like absolute nonsense, and we love it. You can play it\non December 4, 2018.\n\n**1825:** The Quiet Man is a new brawler from Square Enix coming to PS4 and\nPC, and you appear to play as a deaf protagonist who uses heighten senses to\nhis advantage. It looks very unusual, and gives off the impression of a PS2\ngame. Now we’ve got another look at Kingdom Hearts 3. And yes, it still looks\nwonderful.\n\n**1830:** And that’s wrap! Square Enix put on a far shorter showcase than we\nexpected. However, we still saw a range of interesting titles set to launch in\nthe coming months. ****\n\n**What did you think of Square Enix at E3 2018?
