So, in terms of Telsa\ncool points the stakes are about as high as they could be.\n\nThose only making it half way there will still get $1,000 for every one of\nreferrals, but will also be invited to the grand opening of Tesla’s\ngigafactory in Reno, Neveda.\n\n**Read more:[What is Tesla Powerwall: Can this home battery change the\nworld?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/tesla-powerwall-explained-the-\nhome-battery-to-spark-an-energy-revolution)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nOf course, the scheme sounds enticing, but it’ll only be within reach of a\nvery exclusive club.\n\nFirst of all you’re going to have to own a Tesla – no small investment – and\nsecondly, you’re going to need a host of wealthy friends. Good luck.\n\n"}
