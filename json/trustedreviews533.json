The Dark\nPictures Anthology is set to introduce a new series of horror stories,\nstarting with Man of Medan in 2019.\n\n_Trusted Reviews_ has compiled everything you need to know about The Dark\nPictures Anthology including all the latest news, release date, gameplay and\nmore.\n\n**Related:**[ **Upcoming Xbox One\nGames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/upcoming-xbox-one-\ngames-2018-3531040)\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## The Dark Pictures Anthology – what is it?\n\nDescribed as “intense standalone horror games” by Supermassive CEO Pete\nSamuels, it will follow in the footsteps of Until Dawn where “your decisions,\nyour reactions to horror thrown at you, will determine who will and who won’t\nsurvive.”\n\nThis isn’t a PS4 exclusive or being published by Sony, instead launching for\n[PS4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/playstation-4), [Xbox\nOne](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/xbox-one-s) and\n[PC](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/best-gaming-pc-2993099). It also runs\non different technology, utilising Unreal Engine 4 as opposed to the Decima\nEngine.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### The Dark Pictures – Man of Medan: Celebrate Halloween with a spooky new\ntrailer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/the-dark-pictures-anthology-news-\nrelease-date-gameplay-3550643 \"The Dark Pictures – Man of Medan: Celebrate\nHalloween with a spooky new trailer\")\n\n  * [ ![G Flex](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) The 2015 LG G Flex \n\n### LG foldable phone set for CES 2019 – could it steal Samsung’s thunder?\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-foldable-phone-3613552 \"LG foldable\nphone set for CES 2019 – could it steal Samsung’s thunder?\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Blizzcon 2018](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### BlizzCon 2018: All you need to know before this weekend’s big show\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/blizzcon-2018-news-dates-virtual-ticket-\ngoody-bag-schedule-3603422 \"BlizzCon 2018: All you need to know before this\nweekend’s big show\")\n\n  * \n\n## The Dark Pictures Anthology trailer – how does it look?\n\nWe have a brand new trailer for Man of Medan to celebrate Halloween. It\nappears that, much like Until Dawn, this spooky adventure will also have a\nstrange man judging your decisions throughout each playthrough, transporting\nyou back to unusual office as the game progresses. His performance gives us\nthe chills, striking a perfect balance between genuine fear and campy\nsilliness.\n\nBelow you can also watch the announcement trailer for Man of Medan, which is\ncurrently intended as the first entry in Supermassive Games’ Dark Pictures\nAnthology, which will include several episodic titles both touching upon\ndifferent characters, locations and supernatural threats.\n\n## The Dark Pictures Anthology release date – when is it coming out?\n\nMan of Medan, the first entry in the series, will be launching in 2019. No\nspecific release date has been confirmed, though.\n\n## The Dark Pictures Anthology Gameplay Preview – How does it play?\n\nA heck of a lot like Until Dawn, as it turns out. Supermassive Games has\nclearly taken the ‘if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it’ approach with The Dark\nPictures Anthology, and it’s worked wonders. At least, it proved both spooky\nand compelling in the short demo I had a chance to play at Gamescom 2018.\n\nTaking place on an abandoned ship haunted by what is presumably an ancient\ncurse, Man of Medan features a group of hapless teenagers eager to party. As\nexpected, things go terribly wrong and you’re left to fight for survival. My\ntime with the game begins right in the thick of things as I’m taken hostage\nand escorted through the ship’s rusty corridors. My captor is clearly just as\nuneasy as me, making the entire situation ooze a palpable dread.\n\n**Related:**[ **Best PS4\nGames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/ps4-games-3431751)\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nControls feel very similar to Until Dawn as you move around a singular\ncharacter while they explore a specific environment to progress the narrative.\nIt’s strictly linear, only deviating from the established path when you make\ndecisions, which can be both major and minuscule in magnitude.\n\nFor example, I could choose to inspect corpses for a little extra insight or,\nby the end of demo, leave a friend behind to be eaten alive by living corpses.\nChoices like this punctuate the entire experience, and they’re all made to\nserve the unsettling atmosphere that permeates everything.\n\nCamera angles shift majestically to take perfect advantage of the environments\nyou explore. As I descended down a corridor my character was thrust to the\nback of the frame, allowing for a dastardly jump scare as an alien hand crept\naway in the corner. It’s fun, spooky and the exact kind of campy horror I\nsigned up for.\n\n## First Impressions\n\nBeyond what was mentioned above, there isn’t very much more to say about Man\nOf Medan. It’s an extension of Until Dawn both in terms of narrative ambition\nand gameplay mechanics. If you’ve experienced Supermassive’s previous horror\neffort, you’ll likely adore what’s to come in The Dark Pictures Anthology.\n\n**Are you ready to be spooked by Man of Medan?
