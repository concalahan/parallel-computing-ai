Like, crazy,” said Musk. He added that\nthere had been 38,000 pre-orders for the Powerwall, which apparently amounts\nto “crazy off the hook” numbers.\n\nThese pre-orders should account for Tesla’s production output through to mid\n2016, so the Powerwall is essentially sold out for the next year.\n\nTesla has also received 2,500 reservations for the industrial-sized PowerPack.\nGiven that these orders average 10 units each, Musk reckons that this figure\nis more like 25,000.\n\nThe Powerwall is a sleek stationary battery pack designed to be mounted on a\nwall in the average home. Its ability to harness solar energy means that it is\n“completely sustainable, zero carbon,” and can be charged from the existing\npower grid and from sustainable sources.\n\n**Read More:[What is Tesla\nPowerwall?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/tesla-powerwall-explained-\nthe-home-battery-to-spark-an-energy-revolution)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nIt can also carry out money-saving load shifting, which means that it charges\nup overnight when energy rates are cheapest for use during the day when it’s\nmost expensive. Meanwhile solar power can provide a free top up during the\nday, if available.\n\nTesla’s Powerwall is essentially made from the same Lithium Ion cells that\npower its electric cars, such as the Model S. It costs $3,500 (around £2,281)\n– or it will when you can finally get your hands on one.\n\n"}
