This year both the Mate 20 and Mate 20 Pro showcase\none of the market’s first 7nm chipsets in the [Kirin\n980](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/kirin-980-features-release-\ndate-3548238), which happens to boast an enhanced dual-NPU and offer a gamut\nof other benefits too.\n\nIn truth, both the Mate 20 and Mate 20 Pro have a lot in common. Like last\nyear, screen size and technology differ along with battery capacity and the\ninclusion of a handful of different sensors on the Pro model, but beyond that,\nyou can expect a decidedly similar top-tier Android phablet experience; one\nthat Huawei has worked hard to swiftly cultivate in recent years.\n\n**Related:[Best Phablet](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nphablet-3500572)**\n\n## Mate 20 vs Mate 20 Pro: Do they look different?\n\nWhile it’s fair to say that Huawei has taken a fairly holistic approach to\nimproving its smartphones more recently, design is an area where the brand has\ncome on in leaps and bounds.\n\n![Huawei Mate 20\nPro](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nEven before you consider the premium Porsche Design partnership devices we’ve\nseen in recent times (like last year’s [Huawei Mate\nRS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/huawei-mate-rs-porsche-design)),\nthe brand’s flagship phablet line has evolved from a series of unassuming\nmetal slabs into expertly crafted curved glass beauties. The same is true of\nboth the Mate 20 and Mate 20 Pro, which offer rounded glass forms in an array\nof eye-catching hues, no doubt inspired by the likes of the gradient-backed\nTwilight [Huawei P20](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/huawei-p20) from\nearlier this year.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThe Mate 20 Pro’s OLED display also curves away at the edges while the\nstandard Mate 20 is the first of the company’s phones to offer a ‘Dewdrop’\nnotch – a small rounded triangle cut-out that barely encroaches on the screen\nat all, designed explicitly to house the phone’s 24-megapixel front-facing\ncamera.\n\nThe different aspect ratios between these two phones mean the Mate 20 Pro’s\nsmaller 6.39-inch panel lends the phone a much narrower and more ergonomic\nfootprint than the more sizeable Mate 20 (72.3mm vs 77.2mm wide), although\nboth phones weigh about the same.\n\nThe standard Mate 20 features a fingerprint sensor ever so slightly inlaid on\nits back, just like last year’s Mate 10 Pro, while the Mate 20 Pro leaves the\ndesign feature out completely. It instead opts for a more cutting edge in-\ndisplay fingerprint sensor, making this the first phone to bring the\ntechnology to the table on a truly mass market device (it was previously found\non niche handsets like the [Vivo Nex\nS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/vivo-nex) and the aforementioned\nHuawei Mate RS).\n\n![Huawei Mate 20\nPro](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Related:[Best Phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nsmartphone-3431175)**\n\nExpect superior water resistance from the IP68-certified Pro model, but those\nafter a headphone jack will likely side with the marginally less hardy\nstandard Mate 20, especially as Huawei isn’t including a USB-C-to-3.5mm\nheadphone jack adapter in the Pro’s box this time around.\n\nThe rounded square element found all over these phones’ marketing material and\nin physical form on the back of both devices is actually a new triple-camera\narray. Aside from a resolution bump on the Pro, you get a similar imaging\nhardware on both devices, but more on that later.\n\n## Mate 20 vs Mate 20 Pro: How do their specs and features compare?\n\nAs you’ll spot from the comparison table below, whichever Mate 20 grabs you,\nyou’ll benefit from that shiny new Kirin 980 processor. Depending on the\nmarket, with 4GB or 6GB of RAM on the Mate 20 and 6GB available wherever the\nMate 20 Pro can be found, these phones are expected to dole out an exceptional\nflagship experience across the board.\n\nThe big.Middle.LITTLE architecture of the octa-core Kirin 980 chip supposedly\npromises around a 20% speed improvement and a 40% improvement in power\nefficiency when compared to last year’s top Huawei silicon; not to mention\nCat21 LTE support (up to 1.4Gbps) and speedier Wi-Fi than the status quo (up\nto 1.732Gbps).\n\n| **Mate 20** | **Mate 20 Pro**  \n---|---|---  \n**Dimensions** |  158.2 x 77.2 x 8.3mm | 157.8 x 72.3 x 8.6mm  \n**Weight** |  188 grams | 189 grams  \n**Display** |  6.53-inch ‘Dewdrop’ RGBW, 18.7:9, DCI-P3, HDR  \nFHD+ (2244 x 1080) display | 6.39-inch ‘FullView’ curved OLED,  \n19.5:9, DCI-P3, HDR  \nWQHD+ (3120 x 1440) display  \n**Processor** |  Kirin 980 | Kirin 980  \n**RAM** |  4GB/6GB | 6GB  \n**Rear camera** |  16 + 12 + 8-megapixel triple camera | 40 + 20 + 8-megapixel\ntriple camera  \n**Front camera** |  24-megapixel | 24-megapixel w/ depth-sensing face unlock  \n**Battery** |  4000mAh | 4200mAh  \n**Software** |  Android 9.0 Pie w/ EMUI 9 | Android 9.0 Pie w/ EMUI 9  \n**Storage** |  128GB + microSD up to 256GB | 128GB + microSD up to 256GB  \n**Wireless charging** |  None | Yes (15W fast) + wireless reverse charging  \n**Colour** |  Emerald Green, Midnight Blue, Twilight, Pink Gold, Black |\nEmerald Green, Midnight Blue, Twilight, Pink Gold, Black  \n  \nBeyond the core powerplant of these phones, it’s here where the deviations\nbetween the standard and Pro models really start to show. The larger Mate 20\nuses an RGBW LCD panel instead of the Pro’s curved OLED display; although both\nadhere to the DCI-P3 colour space and both tote HDR too. You get a much\nsharper viewing experience on the Pro though, so lack of headphone jack aside,\nthat might be the better choice for media lovers.\n\nMoving over to software, you get Google’s latest and greatest mobile OS out of\nthe box, with [Android 9.0\nPie](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/android-pie) running on both\nofferings from the get-go. That said, Huawei’s updated EMUI 9.0 is as heavy-\nhanded as ever, meaning it’ll feel like previous versions of the company’s\nskinned experience, albeit with a few new improvements like AI-powered\nefficiency bumps and the option of [iPhone\nX](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-x)-like gesture-driven\nnavigation.\n\n**Related:[Best Android Phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nandroid-phones-3438996)**\n\nBoth Mates sport seriously sizeable batteries; the Mate 20 with its 4000mAh\npack, in theory, should match or surpass the longevity of the equally\ncapacious cells found on the [Huawei P20\nPro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/huawei-p20-pro).\n\nThe Mate 20 Pro, meanwhile, showcases a stonkingly huge 4200mAh battery that\nnot only debuts Huawei’s impressively fast new 40W SuperCharge tech (which\npromises 70% charge of the Mate 20 Pro’s big battery in just 30 minutes) but\nfor the first time on a Huawei device, sports up to 15W rapid wireless\ncharging. What’s more, in an industry first, the Pro has the ability to double\nas a wireless charger itself, supplying power to other Qi-enabled smartphones.\n\nThree of the four corners of the Huawei Mate 20 line’s camera setup feature a\ndifferent imaging sensor, while the fourth features a dual-tone LED flash.\nInstead of the monochrome sensor as on its previous flagships, Huawei is now\nconfident that the raw megapixel count of its latest sensors will allow the\nphones to render enough detail outright. As such, both Mates sport an\n8-megapixel _f/_ 2.4 telephoto sensor with OIS (optical image stabilisation),\nand on the Pro a 40-megapixel primary _f/_ 1.8 wide-angle RGB sensor and a\n20-megapixel _f/_ 2.2 ultra-wide angle RGB sensor that can also judge depth\nfor portrait mode style shooting (12 and 16-megapixels respectively on the\nstandard Mate 20).\n\nInitial tests show that this new imaging set-up is even more advanced than the\nalready excellent triple camera on the P20 Pro. It boasts AI-enhanced\nshooting, impressively stabilised 4K video recording at up to 30fps (as tested\non the Mate 20 Pro) and real-time visual effects like colour-pop that use AI\nto better distinguish subject from background.\n\nBoth phones also tote 24-megapixel front-facing sensors, although unlike the\nunobtrusive ‘dewdrop’ notch on the Mate 20, the Mate 20 Pro sports a decidedly\nmore familiar and wider notch that houses 3D depth-sensing technology,\ngranting [iPhone XS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xs)-style\nface unlock security. Unlike Apple’s smartphones, however, Huawei’s tech\ndoesn’t play nice with banking apps and other experiences that support\nbiometric security, so aside from unlocking the phone, you’ll seldom be able\nto make use of it for anything else, unless developers actively choose to\nintegrate Huawei’s specific API’s into their experiences.\n\n## Mate 20 vs Mate 20 Pro: How much are they and when can I get one?\n\nExpect to pay €799 for the 4GB RAM model or €849 for the 6GB RAM version of\nthe Huawei Mate 20. The Mate 20 Pro will cost considerably more, joining the\ngrowing number of flagships hovering around the €/£/$1000 mark, priced at\n€1049. Both phones are slated to launch on October 16.\n\n**Which new Huawei Mate 20 takes your fancy?
