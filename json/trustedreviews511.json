It allows players who\npurchase a digital game on one platform to receive the game for free on the\nother.\n\n## Xbox Play Anywhere launch date\n\nThe Xbox Play Anywhere initiative is available now, with games such as\n[ReCore](https://www.trustedreviews.com/recore-review), [Forze Horizon\n3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/forza-horizon-3-review) and [Gears of War\n4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/gears-of-war-4-review) among the first to\ntake advantage.\n\n“The Windows 10 Anniversary Update and the related Xbox update coming this\nsummer will enable the Windows Store on Windows 10 and Xbox One to support\nXbox Play Anywhere games,” a Microsoft spokesperson told Polygon.\n\n“Then, beginning with the launch of ReCore this fall and continuing with Forza\nHorizon 3, Gears of War 4, Halo Wars 2 and others, when you digitally purchase\na game that supports Xbox Play Anywhere, you have access to the game on both\nXbox One and Windows 10 PCs for one price and your progress, game saves and\nachievements are shared seamlessly across both platforms.”\n\n## What is Xbox Play Anywhere?\n\nThis new service means that, by purchasing a digital game on either Windows 10\nor Xbox One, you’ll receive a free copy of the game on the other platform.\n\nAll games on Xbox Play Anywhere will support cloud saves, cross-play and\nachievements via Xbox Live.\n\nIn a nutshell, you are essentially getting two games for the price of one.  \n**  \nRelated:[ Best Xbox One Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-xbox-one-\ngames_round-up)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n###  Fortnite Guide: How to Complete the Fortnitemares Challenges\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/fortnite-guide-complete-fortnitemares-\nchallenges-3610226 \"Fortnite Guide: How to Complete the Fortnitemares\nChallenges\")\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Google Assistant’s new Roomba trick could allow Google map your home\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-assistant-irobot-roomba-3613603\n\"Google Assistant’s new Roomba trick could allow Google map your home\")\n\n  *   * [ ![uncharted lost legacy](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Best PS4 Games 2018: All the top titles that belong in your library\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-ps4-games-3431751 \"Best PS4 Games\n2018: All the top titles that belong in your library\")\n\n  * \n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## What games are supported?\n\nSome of the games currently announced for the service include:\n\n  * Ark: Survival Evolved\n  * Crackdown\n  * Cuphead\n  * Everspace\n  * Forza Horizon 3\n  * Gears of War 4\n  * Halo Wars 2\n  * Killer Instinct Season 3\n  * Recore\n  * Resident Evil 7\n  * Sea of Thieves\n  * State of Decay 2\n  * The Culling\n  * We Happy Few\n\n**Related:[Xbox One S vs Xbox One – What’s the\ndifference?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/xbox-one-s-vs-xbox-one)**\n\nMicrosoft has clearly dedicated to Xbox Play Anywhere, so we imagine a number\nof titles will be announced in the near future.\n\nRecently there seemed to be some confusion over the phrasing of different\nquotes from Microsoft over exactly which games will be available on Xbox Play\nAnywhere. Some wording led many to believe that all future releases would\nsupport the scheme, but TrustedReviews contacted Microsoft for clarity and\nreceived this comment:\n\n“When we unveiled Xbox Play Anywhere, we said that every new Microsoft Studios\ntitle shown at the Xbox E3 2016 Briefing will support Xbox Play Anywhere.\n\n“We understand that a recent blog post didn’t specify that the only Microsoft\nStudios titles we’ve confirmed to date as Xbox Play Anywhere were shown at the\nE3 2016 Xbox briefing. We’ve updated the blog post and apologize for any\nconfusion. You can go to www.xboxplayanywhere.com to see the current list of\nparticipating games.”\n\nSo while not all games will support the scheme, Microsoft has clarified that\nonly the games shown at E3 2016 currently support Play Anywhere. However,\nthere’s still plenty of potential for future releases to offer the service.\n\n## How do I use it?\n\nIt’s simple and easy. So long as you own a valid game on Xbox One or Windows\n10, you will gain access to the game digitally on both platforms.\n\nThe service will require you to have a Windows 10 anniversary edition update\non your PC, which will launch on August 2, along with the summer update on\nyour Xbox One console. Play Anywhere will only support digital download\nversions of games, not retail disc copies.\n\nThe service will be supported by Xbox One, Xbox One S and any compatible\nWindows 10 PC. We can also expect it to be supported for [Project\nScorpio](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/xbox-scorpio-release-date-specs-\nnews-rumours-4k-vr) when it launches later this year.\n\n_Will you be taking advantage of Xbox Play Anywhere?
