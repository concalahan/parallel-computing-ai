Its Emoji Minis will customise the\nexisting emoji characters in your library to make them look more like you.\n\nIn a blog post Google explains the feature uses a selfie to learn your\nphysical traits, even down to hats, glasses, freckles and piercings. From\nthere you’ll see options to select your personalised Mini when selecting from\nthe existing library of emojis.\n\nBeyond broadening the diversity options, the idea is to add a more personal\ntouch to a hug you may be sending to a friend feeling down in the dumps, for\nexample.\n\n**Related:[Best smartphone 2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nsmartphone-3431175)**\n\nThat means the laughing out loud emoji, the wizard, or the shrugging emjoi\nwill be featured within the Minis menu. Furthermore, users will have the\nability to customise the Minis, giving themselves different colour hair and\naccessories on different days.\n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-\nprod/original_images/Emoji_Characters_Quad_1.gif)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Google Halloween Doodle 18](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Google’s 2018 Halloween Doodle is an addictive multiplayer game – here’s\nhow to play\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-halloween-doodle-2018-game-\nplay-3613241 \"Google’s 2018 Halloween Doodle is an addictive multiplayer game\n– here’s how to play\")\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Google’s Gboard keyboard now creates emoji that look just like you\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-emoji-minis-gboard-3613215\n\"Google’s Gboard keyboard now creates emoji that look just like you\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Apple Watch Series 4](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Apple watchOS 5.1 arrives alongside iOS 12.1, but major feature still\nmissing\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/watchos-5-1-features-3613211 \"Apple\nwatchOS 5.1 arrives alongside iOS 12.1, but major feature still missing\")\n\n  * \n\nIn a [blog post](https://www.blog.google/products/search/green-hair-dont-care-\ncreate-emoji-look-exactly-you-gboard/) the company explains: “After you take a\nselfie, emoji Minis use Google’s machine learning algorithms, known as neural\nnetworks, to suggest a skin tone, hair style and accessories that you can fine\ntune.\n\n“Then, you choose a colour for your hair, facial hair or different types of\nhead coverings and eyewear. Add freckles or wrinkles—a little or a lot—if\nyou’d like. Design your Minis so they resemble what you look like in your\neyes—or in your mind.”\n\nThe feature expands upon the ‘Bold’ and ‘Sweet’ Minis Stickers, which\npreviously enabled users to send customised stickers to each other via Gboard.\nThe feature is now rolling out to the popular keyboard on iOS and Android from\ntoday.\n\n**We aren’t seeing the new Gboard feature yet, so be sure to drop us a line\n@TrustedReviews on Twitter when it turns up on your end.**\n\n"}
