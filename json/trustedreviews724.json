We’re still\nawaiting the update to the Snapdragon 845 and this will likely come towards\nthe end of 2018.\n\n“As OnePlus is at the forefront of technology and innovation, we hope to\ncontinue breaking barriers and be the first to release a phone which supports\n5G,” said Carl Pei, the co-founder of OnePlus.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nObviously, even if a phone has the ability to support 5G it will still need to\nbe connected to the right network to make use of those improved speeds and\nbandwidth. [EE has already trialled\n5G](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ee-5g-trial-uk-three-o2-3482006) in\nthe UK and Qualcomm announced that BT would be one of the global operators to\ntrial 5G with the X50 modem. Whether or not we get an actual 5G service in the\nUK in 2019 remains to be seen.\n\n**Related:[Best smartphones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nsmartphone-3431175)**\n\nOnePlus tends to release two phones year: a main flagship first and then a\nsmaller upgrade usually 6 months later. For instance, the [OnePlus\n6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/oneplus-6) was announced in May with\na new notched-screen design, improved dual-sensor camera system and the\nSnapdragon 845 chipset. The OnePlus 6T, which will be announced on October 29\n– the day before [Apple’s big iPad/Mac\nevent](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-event-october-2018-3607444) –\nlooks set to introduce a smaller notch similar to the Huawei Mate 20 and an\nin-display fingerprint sensor.\n\nOther than the rumoured 5G support, little else is known about the 2019\nOnePlus flagship. However this will likely change in the run up to release.\n\n**Are you going to be buying a 5G-capable phone in 2019? Tweet us\n@TrustedReviews.**\n\n"}
