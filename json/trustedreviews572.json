One glance at the official trailer’s\nlike/dislike ratio is a clear indication that fans aren’t exactly happy with\nthe surprise that closed [BlizzCon\n2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/blizzcon-2018-live-3603422).\n\nBut you shouldn’t judge a book by its cover, especially when it’s covered in\nsuper cool barbarians and demons duking it out. Diablo Immortal is far more\naccomplished than naysayers would have you believe and appears to translate\nthe dungeon-crawling formula to mobile with relative ease.\n\nObviously, it’s been trimmed down in a few places, but that’s a sacrifice\nNetEase would have to make. But it’s still fun, lined with a coating of RPG\nmechanics that encourage you to team up with friends and go hunting for loot.\n\n**Related:**[ **Best iPhone\nGames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/iphone-games-3543122)\n\n![Diablo\nImmortal](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe BlizzCon 2018 demo was rather brief, beginning with me picking between a\nWizard, Monk or Barbarian class. I only had a chance to run the demo with two\nof them, but even then I found sufficient variety amongst all the kills and\nabilities. Barbarians can slam down a series of hammers or whip forward a trio\nof chains to damage enemies in a display of brutality\n\nWizards, on the other hand, prioritise ranged attacks and teleportations due\nto a smaller health bar and the ease of which enemies can obliterate them. My\npersonal favourite is a skill that allows you to zip multiple times around\nfoes, disorientating them before dishing out a couple of lethal attacks.\nThey’re both fun to play, largely thanks to the simple control system.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThere are no keyboard shortcuts here, just a series of touch controls to\nexplore each level and execute myriad abilities. Within seconds I was drawn\nin, able to experiment with moves all with short cooldowns and flashy\nanimations. It’s perhaps a bit too simple, as even the demo’s final boss was a\nbreeze with a few allies by my side.\n\n**Related:**[ **Overwatch – Ashe First\nLook**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/gaming/overwatch-ashe-release-\ndate-3614718)\n\n![Diablo\nImmortal](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAfter a brief tutorial with the one and only Deckard Cain, I’m thrown into a\n15-minute demo where other BlizzCon 2018 attendees are exploring dark, haunted\nswamps and spooky cathedrals alongside me. The aesthetic here is distinctly\nDiablo, albeit with a smaller, more simplified footprint to fit a broad range\nof mobile devices. That being said, it still proved engaging.\n\nYou’re shepherded through stages by simple objectives that require you to kill\ncertain enemies or reach specific areas. These apply to all players in the\nsame instance, so it’s encouraged to get to enemies before they can unless\nyou’re partied up. This is where the massively multiplayer elements of Diablo\nImmortal come into play.\n\nDespite not being entirely developed internally, Blizzard has pitched this\nmobile exclusive as an experience that can easily be played with anyone,\nwhether they’re casual or hardcore. This is likely where some of the criticism\nhas surfaced, delivering something that is anything but a traditional sequel\nin the beloved series. But it deserves a chance and presents something with a\nlot of potential.\n\nJoining other players before entering new areas was seamless, although we were\nonly a few feet away in the same room. How this will work over mobile data or\nregular wi-fi remains unknown, but is a feather in Diablo Immortal’s cap it\nreally can’t afford to lose. But even without that, there’s so much we still\ndon’t know about Diablo Immortal.\n\n**Related:**[ **Best PC Games**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-pc-\ngames-3520096)\n\n![Diablo\nImmortal](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nHowever, the controls are intuitively smooth and combat is light yet\nsatisfying and absurdly easy to pick up and play. The real question is whether\nNetEase can translate Diablo’s absurd depth and uncompromising lore to a\nportable experience outside the main series. It’s a legitimate concern, but\none we can’t draw conclusions on just yet.\n\n## First Impressions\n\nDiablo Immortal is a complicated beast, having already become an object of\ncontroversy simply because it dares to diverge from the legacy Blizzard has\nmade for the series after so many years.\n\nBut I feel it’s in good hands and plays well enough that I can see anyone\ninstalling it on their phones and having a good time. We still know so little\nabout its monetization or progression system, two core ideas that’ll make or\nbroke Immortal in the end.\n\n## Diablo Immortal Release Date\n\nBlizzard is yet to announce a concrete release date, but Diablo Immortal is\nset to launch for iOS and Android devices.\n\n## Diablo Immortal Trailer\n\n**What are your thoughts on Diablo Immortal?
