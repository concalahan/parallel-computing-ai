Jaguar says that eTrophy will be a support\nseries for the FIA Formula E championship, and describes it as the “world’s\nfirst international championship for production-based electric cars”.\n\nAs eTrophy is a support series, all races will take place on the same weekends\nas the same city circuits as the core Formula E races, with Jaguar’s offering\nset to begin in late 2018. It’s similar to how the Porsche Supercup series\nsupports the main Formula One races, for context.\n\nSpeaking about the announcement, Gerd Mäuser, Chairman of Jaguar Racing, said:\n“Jaguar returned to racing in 2016 with the mission ‘Race to Innovate’. With\nthe launch of the Jaguar I-Pace eTrophy we have strengthened our commitment to\nbattery electric vehicles, international motorsport and Formula E.”\n\nBut that’s not all; Jaguar has also announced a dedicated racing version of\nthe Jaguar I-Pace, aptly named Jaguar I-Pace eTrophy.\n\nThe Jaguar I-Pace SUV was first unveiled back in 2016 at the Los Angeles motor\nshow, and is Jaguar’s first all-electric vehicle. It’s still not available,\nbut Jaguar currently slates the motor for release in the second half of 2018.\n\nThe racing version will be built by the team at Jaguar Land Rover Special\nVehicle Operations in Warwickshire, UK, and will feature reconfigured\nsuspension, a roll-cage, and a rear spoiler.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n“We’ve always said we want to prove our electrification technologies on the\ntrack – this is the proof,” said Mäuser. “I am looking forward to seeing a\nfull grid of Jaguar I-Pace racecars in late 2018, soon after the first Jaguar\nI-Pace hits the road in Europe.”\n\nHe added: “Ultimately, this innovative series will enhance the technology in\nour future electric vehicles and benefit our customers.”\n\nBoth announcements come just days after Jaguar Land Rover revealed that all\nnew models launched by the firm from 2020 and beyond would utilise either a\nfully-electric or hybrid drivetrain. It’s a decision made partly in response\nto the UK government’s decision to ban the sale of all new petrol and diesel\ncars from 2040.\n\n**Related:[Jaguar E-Pace](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/jaguar-e-pace-\nrelease-date-uk-price-specs-features-top-speed-images-2993596)**\n\n**What do you think of this announcement?
