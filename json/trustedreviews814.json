However, when it\ncomes to the home environments GPS satellites and its Street View cameras\ncan’t penetrate, the company is found wanting.**\n\nThat could explain part of the reason for the web giant’s [new partnership\nwith iRobot](http://media.irobot.com/2018-10-31-iRobot-and-Google-Collaborate-\nto-Advance-the-Next-Generation-Smart-Home), the maker of the Roomba vacuums,\nwhich maps out an owner’s home to ensure a more effective clean.\n\nRoomba cleaners are now integrated with the Google Assistant, enabling Google\nHome owners to say “Hey Google, clean the kitchen.” In a press release, iRobot\nsays devices like the Roomba i7+ are “ideally suited to enable intuitive and\npersonalised smart home experiences.”\n\nBeyond summoning the Roomba to a particular room following a spill, iRobot\nsays the partnership could simplify smart home setup “based on an ability to\nlearn a home’s floor plan.”\n\n**Related:[Best vacuum cleaner\n2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-vacuum-cleaner)**\n\nThis would, for example, enable Google to more clearly identify which smart\nhome gadgets are in which room, beyond the manual input from users. It could\nassist users in positioning devices like the Home speakers or the mesh Google\nWi-Fi routers for maximum effectiveness.\n\nThe pair plan to “seek additional ways to integrate their platforms, providing\ncustomers with the choice to opt in to new innovative smart home experiences\nthat leverage a broader understanding of the home’s space. For example, the\nspatial awareness of the home that Roomba maintains may help to simplify smart\nhome setup and enable powerful new automations.”\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nIt will also give Google more precise in-home data than it could ever hope\nfor. The company does offer indoor maps of places like airports and shopping\nmalls, but this requires some extremely labour intensive data gathering\ntechniques similar to what it uses for Street View.\n\nNaturally, no-one is letting Google into their homes to carry out that kind of\nwork, despite the fact the company probably would if it could.\n\nWhile the integration could make life easier for consumers, this is certainly\nsomething to keep an eye on. Roomba owners should look for updates to iRobot’s\nprivacy policy to reflect potential amendments acknowledging data sharing with\nGoogle.\n\n**Are you a Roomba owner who’d be willing to improve your smart home set-up by\nsharing data with Google?
