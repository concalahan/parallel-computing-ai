AptX HD is the version that offers the highest possible\nmusic quality, while AptX low-latency focusses on offering (you guessed it) a\nlow latency of below 40ms. Standard AptX, which transmits less data than AptX,\nworks better when there’s lots of radio interference around.\n\nSo each standard has a reason to exist, but the problem is that we use our\nphones for many different things throughout the course of the day. Maybe\nyou’re listening to music in the office when you want the best possible audio\nquality, but when you’re playing a game or two on the bus home you’re likely\nto care far more about latency.\n\n**Related:[What is aptX and aptX\nHD?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/info/aptx-3481900)**\n\n## One standard to rule them all\n\nQualcomm’s solution to this problem is AptX Adaptive. For now, the company has\nconservative ambitions for the standard. It’s replacing AptX Low Latency for\nnow, but AptX’s director, Jonny McClinktock, confirmed to Trusted Reviews that\nthe hope is for it to one day be able to unify the whole lineup under a single\nstandard.\n\nAptX Adaptive’s unique feature is for it to analyse both your content and\nenvironment and change the way it transmits audio appropriately. If it senses\nfrom the audio’s metadata that you’re playing a game, then it will\nautomatically optimise itself to minimise latency.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Call of Cthulhu](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Call of Cthulhu\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/call-of-cthulhu \"Call of Cthulhu\")\n\n  * [ ![iPad Pro 2018](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: MySmartPrice / @OnLeaks \n\n### New iPad Pro 2018 leak shows Apple is almost certainly dropping the Home\nbutton\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ipad-pro-2018-release-date-specs-\nprice-3482812 \"New iPad Pro 2018 leak shows Apple is almost certainly dropping\nthe Home button\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Pete Lau on stage at the OnePlus 6T launch](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### The OnePlus 6T ditched the headphone jack, CEO Pete Lau tells us why\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ceo-pete-lau-oneplus-6t-headphone-jack-\nwireless-charging-3612475 \"The OnePlus 6T ditched the headphone jack, CEO Pete\nLau tells us why\")\n\n  * \n\nMeanwhile, it’s also able to scale the bitrate (read: quality) of the audio\nit’s sending depending on how much radio interference is around you at any\ngiven moment.\n\nIt’s going to take a little while before you’re actually going to make use of\nthe new standard. Qualcomm is releasing chips for the headphone side of the\nequation this September, but the manufacturers buying it are unlikely to have\nheadphones that support it available until next Summer.\n\nEven then, you might want to proceed with caution on the new standard.\nQualcomm is launching AptX Adaptive with support for 24-bit / 48kHz, but the\neventual aim is for it to be able to transmit audio going all the way up to\n96kHz in resolution.\n\nAlthough the difference will be on the software side (meaning the first batch\nof Adaptive headphones should be capable of being upgraded), Qualcomm wasn’t\nable to promise that every pair of headphones would receive an update since it\nwill be up to the individual manufacturers.\n\nIt might take a little while for AptX Adaptive to fully take over, but given\nQualcomm’s dominance of the Bluetooth audio market, we’re betting it will\narrive sooner than you think.\n\n**Do you care about AptX support when you’re buying a phone?
