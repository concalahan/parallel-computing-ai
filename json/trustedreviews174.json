If\nyou’ve got friends, or you think you might one day have friends, this is worth\na purchase.\n\n[**Friday the 13th –\n£4.49**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/438740/Friday_the_13th_The_Game/)\nA game of two sides: on one, you play as Jason Vorhees and hunt down a variety\nof campers to do a murder on them with your mighty weapon and the environment\naround them. On the other, you don’t play as Jason, and you try to put off\nyour inevitable demise as long as possible.\n\n[**The Witcher 3 –\n£13.99**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/292030/The_Witcher_3_Wild_Hunt/)\nThis critically acclaimed RPG is a phenomenal title to lose yourself to. Buy\nThe Witcher 3 on the strength of its several million game of the year awards,\nand prepare to lose all of your free time until the new year.\n\n[**No Man’s Sky –\n£19.99**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/No_Mans_Sky/) After a\ndisappointing launch, No Man’s Sky quietly became one of the best space\nexploration games ever made. Among the features the team added, there’s now\nmultiplayer, buildable bases and a recent Halloween content drop called the\nAbyss that makes things extra spooky.\n\n[**Warhammer Vermintide 2:\n£11.89**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/552500/Warhammer_Vermintide_2/)\nKill rats, orcs and chaos minions in Fatshark’s Vermintide sequel. Warhammer:\nVermintide 2 is a compelling first person title with a focus on melee, and\nit’s all fun and games until you get punted into the middle distance by an\nangry troll.\n\n[**Dead By Daylight:\n£7.49**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/381210/Dead_by_Daylight/) This\nhorror game is, for my money, the best multiplayer horror title out there.\nDead By Daylight takes advantage of several strong licensing deals to let\nkillers stalk and kill the opposing team using Michael Myers, Leatherface or\neven the woman from Saw that used to help Jigsaw out. She’s wearing a pig mask\nhere. Spooky.\n\n[**Terraria: £3.49**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/105600/Terraria/)\nWhat if Metroid, Zelda and Minecraft had a 2D baby? Terraria. That’s what.\nThis is a great adventure game with the ability to let you do a variety of fun\nbuilding and crafting, but also has some challenging boss fights and a\nsurprising amount of depth. Better yet, it’s co-operative. Pour one out for\nthe canned sequel.\n\n[**Left 4 Dead 2:\n£1.43**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/550/Left_4_Dead_2/) Zombies, 4\nplayer co-op and some cracking set pieces, Valve’s classic set the standard\nfor online cooperative games.\n\n[**Prey: £9.99**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/480490/Prey/) One of the\nbest immersive sims of the last few years, Arkane’s space simulator is a\ncracker.\n\n[**Payday 2: Ultimate Edition:\n£8.54**](https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/3756/PAYDAY_2_Ultimate_Edition/)\nTeam up with friends, do crimes.

Also John Wick is a playable character.\n\n[**Graveyard Keeper = £\n11.61**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/599140/Graveyard_Keeper/) Like\nStardew Valley, but with fresh corpses.\n\n## When is the next Steam Sale?
