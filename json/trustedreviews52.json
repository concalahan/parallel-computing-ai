Here’s everything we now know, including details of the UK and US\nnetworks that will offer them, plus pricing, release date, and battery life\ninformation.**\n\nThe key selling point for this new range of laptops is that, by utilising\nQualcomm’s 10nm [Snapdragon\n835](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/snapdragon-835-phones-processor-\nspecs-speed-benchmark-chipset-cores-2944086) SoC instead of the more power\nhungry Intel processors typically found in [Windows\n10](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/windows-10) laptops, all-day\nbattery life could finally be a reality for PCs.\n\nThis will be aided by the fact that the devices in question will run\nMicrosoft’s stripped back Windows 10 S operating system (now Windows 10 S\nMode), rather than the chewier Windows 10 Home or Windows 10 Pro.\n\nBack at the company’s 2017 5G Summit in Hong Kong, Executive VP of Qualcomm\nTechnologies Cristiano Amon told _Trusted Reviews_ to expect the devices to\noffer an “extreme gain in battery life” compared to traditional laptops,\nsaying:\n\n> “For Netflix streaming with LTE, we’re looking at 28, 29 hours playback.\nWe’re looking at all-day computing with everything on in excess of 16, 17, 18\nhours.”\n\nThere’s currently a trio of Snapdragon 835 laptops ready to hit shelves in the\nnear future, which have been variously teased since late-2017. These are the\n[Lenovo Miix 630](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/lenovo-miix-630)\n(pictured below), [HP Envy x2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/hp-\nenvy-x2), and [Asus NovaGo](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/asus-nova-\ngo). As well as the Snapdragon 835, they’ll also be equipped with Qualcomm’s\nSnapdragon X16 modem, which offers Gigabit LTE speeds and eSIM functionality\n\nCrucially, Qualcomm has now unveiled its network and retail partners in a\nnumber of key markets, including the UK and US.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nIn the UK, Snapdragon laptops are initially lined up as an EE network\nexclusive, while our US readers will be able to choose from T-Mobile, AT&T,\nSprint and Verizon. You’ll be able to buy them from Asus Stores, BT Shop, John\nLewis, Microsoft Stores and PC World here in Blighty, while over in the States\nthe launch retailers are Amazon and Microsoft Stores.\n\nUK-specific pricing for the trio of devices hasn’t been confirmed yet, but\nwe’re hoping to find out at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.\n\nHowever, we do know that the Miix 360 will start at $799, while Qualcomm\nDirector of Product Management, Monte Giles, told us back at [IFA\n2017](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ifa-2017-news-rumours-\nhighlights-2993271) that initial pricing will range from $600-$800. That’s\nabout £450-£600 before you account for taxes and regional premiums, so we’d\nproffer that £499-£699 is what the UK market can expect.\n\nIn terms of a final release date, we’ve only be told that Q2 2018 is the\nwindow to watch, but again, we’ll be digging for more concrete details out in\nSpain.\n\n**Related:[Best laptops](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-laptops)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Snapdragon Laptops: Why you should care about these new Windows 10\nnotebooks\n\nPCs with built-in mobile transceivers have been around for ages, so what’s\nactually new here? That’s a good question.\n\nWhat makes this an interesting batch of new products is the fact that\nQualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 will be powering laptops for the first time. This is\nbig, because Qualcomm chips are based on ARM designs, which are very different\nto the x86 architecture used on AMD and Intel chips – the kind you’ll find in\nregular laptops.\n\nUntil fairly recently, Windows didn’t work on ARM-based chips, but with that\nhurdle out of the way, the first-generation of Snapdragon laptops are poised\nto offer the kind of thin and light design most consumers want, combined with\nample processing power and – perhaps most importantly – more robust battery\nlife.\n\nThis is because the Snapdragon 835 uses what’s called bigLITTLE tech, where\nfour cores are high power and four are low power, so background tasks are\nrelegated to the lower-powered cores when they’re not urgent and your battery\nlife is better preserved.\n\nAs we’ve said, that means we’re being told to expect true all-day or even\nmulti-day battery life from Snapdragon-powered laptops, even if they’re being\nused for high-intensity tasks like streaming.\n\nHere’s what Pete Bernard, Principal Group Program Manager for Connectivity\nPartners at Microsoft, told us last year about the stamina of Windows 10\nSnapdragon laptops.\n\n> “The final numbers aren’t in, but the battery life is really, really good.\nTo be frank, it’s actually beyond our expectations. It’s the kind of battery\nlife where I use it on a daily basis, I don’t take my charger with me. I may\ncharge it every couple of days or so. It’s that kind of battery life.”\n\nThe other really attractive thing about the Snapdragon 835 in terms of\nconnectivity is Qualcomm’s latest X16 LTE modem, which has a theoretical\nmaximum speed of a gigabit. Whether you get that will depend on your mobile\nreception, of course, but it should mean that on-the-go Netflix binging is a\ndawdle.\n\nWe’ll have to test the first batch of Snapdragon 835-powered laptops in full\nbefore we can corroborate these promises, but it’s safe to say that the\ncombination of high-speed, ‘always on’ LTE connectivity and day-plus battery\nlife would be one of the most exciting PC developments in some time.\n\n**Related:[Snapdragon\n845](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/snapdragon-845-benchmark-phones-\nspeed-3390981)**\n\n**_Are you excited for the first-generation of Snapdragon laptops to launch?\nTweet your thoughts to us @TrustedReviews._**\n\n"}
