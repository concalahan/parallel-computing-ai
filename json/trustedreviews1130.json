You’ve got the [iPhone\nXS,](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-xs-release-date-specs-price-\nuk-3551351) iPhone XS Max and [Apple Watch\n4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-watch-series-4-3487177). Plus\nthere’s the iPhone XR coming in October. But how does it compare to the\n[Samsung Galaxy S9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9)?\n\n**Related:[iPhone XR vs iPhone XS vs iPhone XS\nMax](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-xr-vs-iphone-xs-vs-iphone-xs-\nmax-3565104)**\n\n## **iPhone XS vs Samsung Galaxy S9 – Design**\n\nBoth flagship devices are constructed from metal and glass, but that’s where\nthe similarities end. The Samsung Galaxy S9 is all curves and slopes, whereas\nthe iPhone is flat and rounded.\n\nThe stainless steel rim of the iPhone XS is made to be seen, while the\naluminium rim sandwiching the front and rear of the Galaxy S9 almost melts\ninto the glass.\n\n**Related:[iPhone XR](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-xr-release-\ndate-specs-price-3579137)**\n\n![iphone\nXS](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Call of Cthulhu](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n###  Call of Cthulhu\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/call-of-cthulhu \"Call of Cthulhu\")\n\n  * [ ![iPad Pro 2018](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: MySmartPrice / @OnLeaks \n\n### New iPad Pro 2018 leak shows Apple is almost certainly dropping the Home\nbutton\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ipad-pro-2018-release-date-specs-\nprice-3482812 \"New iPad Pro 2018 leak shows Apple is almost certainly dropping\nthe Home button\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Pete Lau on stage at the OnePlus 6T launch](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### The OnePlus 6T ditched the headphone jack, CEO Pete Lau tells us why\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ceo-pete-lau-oneplus-6t-headphone-jack-\nwireless-charging-3612475 \"The OnePlus 6T ditched the headphone jack, CEO Pete\nLau tells us why\")\n\n  * \n\nAnother difference between the two devices can be seen on the front. The\niPhone XS adopts the notched screen, featuring a cut-out at the top that\ncontains the front-facing camera. The Galaxy S9, on the other hand, extends\nthe bezel slightly to fit this functionality in. Not everyone will love the\nnotch since it impedes what’s on the screen. Personally, we prefer the\napproach taken by Samsung.\n\nThe other reason Apple opts for the notch solution is the sheer amount of tech\nrequired for its [Face ID](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/face-\nid-3286453) facial recognition to work. Apple has completely ditched all other\nforms of biometric security, so the only way of unlocking the iPhone – other\nthan a PIN – is with your visage.\n\n**Related:[Best smartphones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nsmartphone-3431175)**\n\nFocusing on one form of security means that Apple’s solution works far better\nthan that of Samsung. Both the iris scanner and face recognition on the Galaxy\nprove hit or miss. Samsung does also have a fingerprint sensor, which some\nusers will appreciate.\n\nBoth handsets pack water-resistant\n[IP68](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/what-is-ip68-ip-ratings-\nexplained-2947135) bodies and Qi wireless charging, plus speakers that push\nthe sound towards your face. The Galaxy S9 is the only one of the two to boast\na headphone jack, however.\n\n### Trusted Reviews Exclusive iPhone XS Deal\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n###\n\n[Apple iPhone XS – 10GB, £40pm with £350 upfront on O2\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\nGiving you plenty of data for the low price of just £40 a month, this monthly\ncontract with O2 is an incredible deal that can't be missed if you want to be\none of the first people to own an iPhone XS.\n\n[Mobiles.co.uk\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n|\n\n£350 upfront\n\n|\n\n£40/month\n\n[View\nDeal](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n£40/month\n\n|\n\n£350 upfront\n\n|\n\n[Mobiles.co.uk\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n## **iPhone XS vs Samsung Galaxy S9 – Specs and features**\n\n| **iPhone XS** | **Galaxy S9**  \n---|---|---  \n**Display** |  5.8-inch 19.5:9  \n1124 x 2436 AMOLED | 5.8-inch sAMOLED  \n**Processor** |  Apple A12 | 845/Exynos 9810  \n**RAM** |  4GB | 4GB  \n**Rear camera** |  Dual 12-megapixels | 12-megapixels  \n**Front camera** |  7-megapixels | 8-megapixels  \n**Battery** |  TBC | 3000mAh  \n**Software** |  iOS 12 | Android 8  \n**Storage** |  64/256/512GB | 64/256GB  \n  \nPowering the Samsung Galaxy S9 is a selection of top-end specs: Snapdragon\n845/Exynos 9810 CPU (depending on which part of the world you’re in), 4GB of\nRAM, a modem with support for Gigabit LTE, and all the latest Bluetooth and\nWi-Fi standards. There’s also a slot for expandable storage – a feature you’ll\nnever see on an iPhone.\n\nAnother high-end spec is the screen. On the front of the Samsung Galaxy S9 is\na 5.8-inch [OLED](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/oled-vs-qled-3530313)\npanel with a QHD+ resolution, offering 1000 nits of brightness, and support\nfor [HDR](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/hdr-tv-high-dynamic-\ntelevision-explained-2927035) from Prime Video, YouTube and Netflix. It’s a\nglorious display that’s one of the best around. There’s a larger Galaxy S9\nPlus available, too, sporting a 6.2-inch screen.\n\nThe iPhone XS also uses OLED tech for its display and, again, is available in\ntwo sizes. There’s the regular iPhone XS with a 5.8-inch display and the\nlarger iPhone XS Max with a 6.5-inch screen. Like the Galaxy S9, these devices\nsupport HDR through the Dolby Vision format.\n\nThe iPhone XS (and the XS Max) runs the new [A12\nBionic](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-a12-3462239) 7nm chip from\nApple, along with 4GB RAM and comes with storage ranging from 64GB to 512GB.\n\n**Related:[iPad Pro 2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ipad-\npro-2018-release-date-specs-price-3482812)**\n\n![Samsung Galaxy S9\nfront](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nWe’ve tested the Galaxy S9 thoroughly and found it impressed in the\nperformance stakes, so it will be interesting to see how the iPhone XS and\niPhone XS Max compare.\n\nBoth the iPhone XS and Samsung Galaxy S9 have voice assistants in Siri and\nBixby respectively, with the S9 also able to double-up as a desktop computer\nthanks to [DeX](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-dex).\n\n## **iPhone XS vs Samsung Galaxy S9 – Camera**\n\nThe biggest update the to Samsung Galaxy S9 has been its camera. The\n12-megapixel sensor has a variable aperture lens that can switch between f/1.5\nand f/2.4, depending on the environment and what you’re shooting.\n\nThis is clever, and it works well in practice. If the room you’re shooting in\nis dark, the lens will open up to f/1.5 and let more light into the sensor,\nresulting in a brighter picture. When the light is better, the lens will\nshrink down to f/2.4.\n\n![iPhone\nXS](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe Galaxy S9 also supports 4K video at 60fps, super slow-motion recording,\nand features an 8-megapixel camera around the front for selfies. It’s a decent\ncamera setup, but one that even so has been beaten by the [Google Pixel\n2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-2).\n\nThe camera also happens to be one of the biggest areas of improvement for the\niPhone XS.\n\nYou’ve still got two 12-megapixel sensors, one for regular photos and one for\nzoomed shots, but Apple says the sensor has been completely rebuilt with\nlarger pixels. The front-facing 7-megapixel camera is also faster than before\nand it can now shoot video with stereo-sound.\n\nLike the Google Pixel 2, the iPhone XS uses computational photography and the\nneural engine inside the A12 Bionic to power the new Smart-HDR mode. This\ntakes multiple shots as soon as you open the camera app and it’ll even shoot a\nfew overexposed shots to improve the highlights and shadows.\n\nBoth phones have a portrait mode and they both allow you to alter the strength\nof the bokeh effect in post-production.\n\n## **iPhone XS vs Samsung Galaxy S9 – Price**\n\nWhen it launched in April 2018, the Samsung Galaxy S9 retailed for £749 for\nthe regular version and £869 for the larger Plus-sized version.\n\nThe iPhone XS is a lot pricier, starting at £999 for the base 64GB version and\nrising to £1099 for the larger 6.5-inch Max. If you want more storage you’ll\nhave to pay £1149 (256GB) or £1449 for the 512GB version.\n\n### Trusted Reviews Exclusive iPhone XS Deal\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n###\n\n[Apple iPhone XS – 10GB, £40pm with £350 upfront on O2\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\nGiving you plenty of data for the low price of just £40 a month, this monthly\ncontract with O2 is an incredible deal that can't be missed if you want to be\none of the first people to own an iPhone XS.\n\n[Mobiles.co.uk\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n|\n\n£350 upfront\n\n|\n\n£40/month\n\n[View\nDeal](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n£40/month\n\n|\n\n£350 upfront\n\n|\n\n[Mobiles.co.uk\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n## **Early verdict**\n\nNeither of these phones is a huge update over their predecessors, but they\nstill have upgrades to important aspects, such as the camera. Whether the\niPhone XS is worth over £250 more than the Galaxy S9 remains to be seen.\n\n"}
