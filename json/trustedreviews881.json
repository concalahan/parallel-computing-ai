The PowerRay is an underwater\ndrone that lets you do just that, and it might help you catch your dinner,\ntoo.**\n\nThink of a drone and you’ll probably think of something like the [DJI Mavic\nPro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/dji-mavic-pro), the [GoPro\nKarma](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/gopro-karma) or [Parrot\nMambo](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/parrot-mambo). Namely, you think\nof something that takes to the air. Well you throw those misconceptions right\nout the window right now.\n\nThe PowerRay will let you take to the waters, diving into the deep unknown.\nWith a diving depth of 30m and 4 hour diving time, that’s plenty to get a view\nof the deep blue without the need to squeeze yourself into a scuba suit. The\nPowerRay will work in salt, fresh or even chlorinated water without a problem.\n\n![PowerVision\nPowerRay](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nBattery life is far higher than your average airborne drone for a number of\nreasons. Not having to take to the air and keep weight low is going to be one\nof them, but the other is that the PowerRay remains tethered to a land-based\npower pack, which stores a battery. It also communicates with the PowerRay’s\nremote control, which otherwise would not be able to communicate to the\nPowerRay through the water. The PowerRay has a 2m/s diving speed.\n\n> Like something from an episode of Stingray…\n[#IFA2017](https://twitter.com/hashtag/IFA2017?src=hash)\n[pic.twitter.com/IRiywhkMv5](https://t.co/IRiywhkMv5)\n\n>\n\n> — Richard Easton (@chocojetpack) [September 1,\n2017](https://twitter.com/chocojetpack/status/903652171983486976)\n\nThe PowerRay can capture 4K footage and stream in 1080p to a remote display or\nVR headset, so you can have a view of the deep blue you otherwise wouldn’t\nget. It can also capture 12-megapixel stills. Onboard is 32GB or 64GB of\nstorage.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n![PowerVision\nPowerRay](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe PowerRay’s other defining feature is its skills as a fishing companion\nthrough optional accessories. There’s a Fishfinder that works alongside to see\nreal-time information on fish distribution, landscape, underwater temperature\nand depth. You can even get fish alerts from the app so you can take a\ntactical nap. Then there’s the Precision Remote Bait Drop, which allows you to\nplace the fish bait at a desired position. Top that all off with a fish luring\nlight on the front and you might find yourself with a serious prize catch.\n\nThe PowerRay costs between €1,599 to €2,099 and is available now.\n\n**Are you going to add one to your bait box?
