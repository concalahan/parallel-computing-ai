She’s lost family and friends and\nhas grown up in a world filled with undead horrors. She’s also a proven\nbadass, having killed more zombies than we could ever dream of. But now, her\nadventure is coming to an end, with one final round of episodes.\n\nWe’ve compiled everything you need to know about The Walking Dead: The Final\nSeason including all the latest news, release date, story details and more.\n\n## **What is The Walking Dead: The Final Season?**\n\nTelltale has made it clear that this will be Clementine’s swansong; her final\nadventure before disappearing into the apocalyptic night. Story details are\nthin, although we can draw a few ideas from the way in which the last season\nconcluded. We’ll go into more, **spoiler-filled** detail below.\n\n**Related:**[ **The Wolf Among Us Season\n2**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/wolf-among-us-season-2-everything-\nknow-3132016)\n\n![the walking\ndead](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## **The Walking Dead: The Final Season release date – When is it coming\nout?**\n\nThe first episode of The Walking Dead’s final season will launch for\n[PS4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/playstation-4), [Xbox\nOne](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/xbox-one-s),\n[PC](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/best-gaming-pc-2993099) and other\nplatforms on August 14.\n\n## **The Walking Dead: The Final Season story – What’s it about?**\n\nTaking place after the events of [The Walking Dead: New\nFrontier](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/telltales-the-walking-dead-\nseason-3-a-new-frontier), Clementine finds herself setting off in search of\ninfant AJ after learning of his location from Dr Lingard.

Melissa Hutchison\nreprises her role once again, and seems awfully excited about things to come.\n\n## **The Walking Dead: The Final Season wishlist – What we’d love to see**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Closure for Clementine**\n\nClementine has cemented her place as one of gaming’s greatest characters since\ndebuting in 2012. Her evolution from a helpless child to a responsible and\ncapable young adult has been compelling.\n\nBut now, it’s time to put her story to rest. We want to see this final season\nbring her narrative arc to a satisfying conclusion. Perhaps she finds a way to\nlive peacefully in this undead world, or goes out in a heroic flourish. Either\nway, we don’t want to see our time with her end on a cliffhanger.\n\n**Expand on the Telltale formula**\n\nThe New Frontier made a commendable effort in regards to revitalising the\nTelltale formula. Some of your decisions were subverted, and the updated\nvisuals helped overcome the usual technical shortcomings. Despite this, each\nepisode still followed a rigid path of progression that hasn’t really changed\nin years.\n\nIf possible, The Final Season should expand upon the binary decision-making\nwe’ve come to expect from Telltale’s usual adventures. Perhaps Clementine’s\ndialogue could be made more ambiguous, meaning the good/evil moral quandaries\nare far less obvious.\n\nOne such decision in The New Frontier asked you to sacrifice a character’s\nlife, and upon making up your mind, the carpet was pulled from under you and a\ncompletely different ultimatum occurred. Outside of the box, narrative shifts\nsuch as this are more than welcome.\n\n**Related:**[ **Xbox One X**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/xbox-\none-x)\n\n![the walking dead\n](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\n**A more compelling villain**\n\nIt’s hard to blame Telltale for failing to capture the same sense of\nvillainous loathing seen in the likes of Negan and The Governor in _The\nWalking Dead_ ’s TV show and comics. They’re absolutely despicable human\nbeings, having committed acts that would make even the most hardened of\nwarlords blush.\n\nWe’d love to see The Final Season conjure up a similar big bad, who feels\ngenuinely terrifying to encounter. If this truly is Clementine’s final outing,\nit’s about time she met her match.\n\n_What’s on your wishlist for The Walking Dead: Final Season? Let us know on\nTwitter and Facebook!_\n\n"}
