Add to that an incredible number of stages,\nassist characters, items and everything we’ve ever loved about this franchise,\nNintendo is going all out to make the Nintendo Switch entry definitive. The E3\n2018 demo is beautiful and bombastic, but it does raise the question of where\non earth the series goes in the future.\n\nJumping into some four-player smash, it’s as chaotic as you’ve always\nremembered it. Of course, Ridley is my first port of call, and the iconic\nvillain is fun to control but doesn’t have the fluidity of others on the\nroster. Ridley will be one for experts, as moves are slow but certainly pack a\npunch. It feels like Ridley will belong in the Ganondorf camp where, when used\ncorrectly, will be absolutely devastating.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\n**Related:[Mario Tennis Aces](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/mario-\ntennis-aces)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSpeaking of, once again Ganandorf feels massively overpowered. Let him charge\nup an attack and you’ll be flying off the screen in seconds. We can see both\nnewcomers and veterans alike taking advantage of the villain.\n\nMy new favorite character is almost certainly Inkling, despite the match in\nwhich I played as her being my worst performance. She’s quick, agile and her\nmoves are most certainly going to drive other players insane. She can freeze\nplayers in ink using the Splat Roller, which gives players an opportunity to\nland a barrage of attacks while planted. She’s not a high damage-dealer, but\nthe speed makes up for it.\n\nRyu and Snake were next up and both were excellent fun. Ryu, in particular, is\namazing to control with all his moves being exactly where you’d want them to\nbe. Shoryuken on the up special, Hadouken as the basic special and Tatsumaki\nSenpukyaku as the toward special. He controls more precise than I could have\never hope for.\n\nBut of course, amongst all this precision, is the utter chaos of a Smash Bros\ngame. At times you’ll completely lose your character’s position on-screen, and\noften barely know what is going on amongst the madness, especially when\nassisting characters and screen-filling items are added to the mix, but that’s\nall part of what makes Smash so special, and it’s almost perfected in\nUltimate.\n\n**Related:[Let’s Go: Pikachu and Let’s Go: Eevee!\nPreview](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/pokemon-lets-go-pickachu-eevee-\nnintendo-switch-release-date-gameplay-3479295)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nOne potential criticism which can be levied at Ultimate at this point is it\ndoesn’t really do anything new, rather it does literally everything the\nfranchise has ever done in one package. It’s naturally the best-looking Smash\nthere’s ever been, but it’s also going to feel very familiar at the same time.\nBeing a compendium or almost ‘greatest hits’, it has an almost unintentional\nfeeling of being a phenomenal endpoint for the series.\n\nIt’s hard to imagine a game such as this getting a sequel because it’s so\ndefinitive. It’s so complete and utterly chock-full of everything a Smash fan\ncould ever want.\n\n## First Impressions\n\nThis is the most refined, definitive and biggest Smash Bros. game there has\never been. To bring together pretty much everything the series has ever seen\nin one package is a bonkers but brilliant idea.\n\nThe only question is how on earth Nintendo plans on topping this if they ever\ndo so.\n\n**Related:**[ **Upcoming Nintendo Switch\nGames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/upcoming-nintendo-switch-\ngames-3522184)\n\n![super smash bros\nultimate](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Smash Bros Ultimate Trailer – How does it look?\n\n## Smash Bros Ultimate Roster – who is confirmed?\n\nUltimate has a staggering amount of familiar faces alongside a few new ones\njoining the crossover’s fray.\n\nEveryone is back.
