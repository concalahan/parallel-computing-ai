The [Sony Xperia\nXZ3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sony-xperia-xz3) comes a mere six\nmonths after the XZ2 and might be a bit of a blow to those who have recently\ninvested in the device.\n\nWhile the launch of a flagship so soon might not be welcomed by all, the fast\nturnaround does mean that Sony can quickly address any issues and offer new\nfeatures without having to wait for a further six months to do so.\n\nThe Xperia XZ2 was a step in the right direction for Sony Mobile, but the XZ3\ntakes things even further. Could this be Sony’s best phone yet?\n\n## **1\\. Display – OLED or LCD**\n\nArguably the biggest upgrade with the XZ3 is the display. Sony has ditched LCD\nand instead taken inspiration from its\n[A1](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sony-a1-oled) television line,\nopting for OLED instead.\n\n**Related:[Best smartphones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nsmartphone-3431175)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThis is the same display tech seen in handsets such as the [Samsung Galaxy\nS9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9) and [iPhone\nX](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-x), and it gives better\ncontrast, brighter colours and more immersive blacks. Even after only a couple\nof hours with the XZ3, the improvements were obvious.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThe display resolution has been boosted too, now sitting at quad-HD+ rather\nthan FHD+. HDR support remains, as does the 18:9 aspect ratio and a distinct\nlack of notch.\n\n## **2\\. The design is a big improvement**\n\nThe components required for an OLED panel are thinner than those needed for\nLCD, which means you can produce a slimmer phone as a result. And that’s\nexactly what Sony has done.\n\nThe XZ3 is notably better-looking than the XZ2, thanks to a curvier body and a\nrugged aluminium rim holding the Gorillas Glass 5 in place.\n\nOne issue that remains is the poor positioning of the fingerprint sensor. It’s\nfar too close to the middle of the rear and is difficult to hit accurately.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## **3\\. Not much has changed in the camera, apart from the UI**\n\nLike the [Sony Xperia XZ2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sony-xperia-\nxz2), the XZ3 boasts a Sony-made 19-megapixel sensor with an f/2.0 aperture\nand the ability to properly record 4K HDR video. Sony reps did say the\nunderlying software has been improved since the XZ2’s release, so there’s a\nchance you might see better pictures.\n\nThe real updates have come in the camera interface, which is a lot cleaner and\neasier to navigate than before. No longer are the various modes buried beneath\nmultiple menus, instead easily available with a swipe.\n\n## **4\\. Android Pie is here at launch**\n\nWhen it launches in October, the Sony Xperia XZ3 will be one of the first\nphones to come running the latest version of Android.\n\n[Android 9 Pie](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/android-pie) brings in\nnew Digital Wellness features, an updated look and lots more features.\n\n**Related:[When will my phone get Android\nPie?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/android-pie-9-phones-3535543)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nOne feature missing is the updated navigation keys and the new multitasking\nview. Instead, you get the traditional Android back, home and overview keys,\nand the Rolodex-style multi-tasking menu.\n\nSony has also added a few new software features of its own. You can quickly\nraise the phone to engage the camera, or tap the sides of the screen to bring\nup a quick app launcher.\n\n## **5\\. A bigger battery, but no likely performance boosts**\n\nInternally, there’s very little to differentiate the XZ3 and XZ2. Both are\npowered by a Snapdragon 845, have 4GB of RAM and 64GB of expandable storage.\nMore RAM would have been nice, but 4GB will likely get the job done.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nOne upgrade is the battery size, which is now 3330mAh as opposed to 3180mAh.\nPair that larger cell with the more efficient screen and there’s hope this\nphone could last longer between charges.\n\n_**Would you upgrade from the XZ2 to the XZ3?
