The Portal Plus, meanwhile, features\na 15-inch, 1920 x 1080 pivoting display (in portrait), and is up for pre-order\nfor $349 (~£270). For context, the 7-inch Echo Show costs £199.\n\n**Related:[Google Home vs Amazon\nEcho](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-home-vs-amazon-\necho-2945424)**\n\nOther than the size and resolution differences, and the fact that one has a\nscreen that can pivot and the other doesn’t, the only difference between\nPortal and Portal Plus is the general design. You can buy them both\n[here](https://portal.facebook.com/).\n\n![facebook\nportal](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nFacebook says both Portal and Portal Plus start shipping in November, but\nthere’s no word yet on whether or not the devices will ever see a UK release.\n\nFirst and foremost, they’re video chat devices. That means they’re equipped\nwith a camera and a microphone, but to calm fears from privacy-conscious\nconsumers, the social network will let you disable the camera and microphone\nwith a single tap. There’s also a camera cover.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nThe company says Portal’s camera is AI-powered, and it can automatically pan\nand zoom to keep everyone in view. The microphone, meanwhile, has a feature\nthat Facebook calls ‘Smart Sound technology’, which is designed to minimise\nbackground noise and enhance the voice of the person speaking.\n\nYou can use Portal to call any of your Facebook friends through Messenger,\nwhether or not they also own a Portal device. Portal supports group calls of\nup to seven people at a time, Facebook says, and you can make use of a\nselection of Snapchat-inspired AR effects too.\n\n![facebook portal\nplus](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nYou can start a video call hands-free by saying “Hey Portal” and the name of\nthe person you’d like to call.\n\n“We know that privacy and security are important when you bring new technology\ninto your home,” wrote Facebook in a blog post. “That’s why we designed Portal\nwith tools that give you control.”\n\nIt continues: “To manage Portal access within your home, you can set a four-\nto 12-digit passcode to keep the screen locked. Changing the passcode requires\nyour Facebook password.\n\n“We also want to be up front about what information Portal collects, help\npeople understand how Facebook will use that information, and explain the\nsteps we take to keep it private and secure:\n\n“Facebook doesn’t listen to, view, or keep the contents of your Portal video\ncalls. Your Portal conversations stay between you and the people you’re\ncalling. In addition, video calls on Portal are encrypted, so your calls are\nalways secure.\n\n“For added security, Smart Camera and Smart Sound use AI technology that runs\nlocally on Portal, not on Facebook servers. Portal’s camera doesn’t use facial\nrecognition and doesn’t identify who you are.\n\n“Like other voice-enabled devices, Portal only sends voice commands to\nFacebook servers after you say, ‘Hey Portal’”.\n\nFacebook says you can delete Portal’s voice history in your Facebook Activity\nLog, which you can access by clicking the downwards-pointing arrow that\nappears in the top-right corner of any Facebook page, and selecting Activity\nLog from the popup menu.\n\n**Read more:[Best security camera](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nsecurity-camera-wifi-wireless-smart-home-monitor-pet-dog-cat)**\n\nThe Portal and Portal Plus were\n[reportedly](https://public.eagleapi.io/magpie/time-inc/trusted-\nreviews/AUTO/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloomberg.com%2Fnews%2Farticles%2F2018-03-28%2Ffacebook-\nis-said-to-delay-home-speaker-unveil-amid-data-\ncrisis&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.trustedreviews.com%2Fnews%2Ffacebook-smart-\nspeaker-3435134&vars%5BipcTags.contentId%5D=3435134&vars%5Bmagpie_data.ga_id%5D=338623836.1522053779)\noriginally supposed to launch at the start of May.\n\nHowever, Facebook is believed to have pushed back its original plans because\nof the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which escalated in March. Because of this\napparent delay, [according\nto](https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20180423PD205.html) DigiTimes, Facebook\nhas also cut its 2018 order volume by around 20%.\n\n**Do Facebook’s rumoured smart speaker plans concern or excite you?
