He\nsaid that owning a traditional car would become like owning and riding a horse\n– something you do for sentimental rather than practical reasons.\n\nMusk also claimed to be surprised that two of his three major ventures – Tesla\nand private space travel company SpaceX – were still running. At the outset,\nhe only gave both companies a 10 percent chance of succeeding.\n\n(apester:56671355b8db3ddc5ef5c366)\n\nWhat do you think about Musk’s comment’s against Apple? Let us know below.\n\n"}
