But\nwhat makes the Galaxy S8 different from the Galaxy S7 when it comes to design,\nspecs and price? Here’s a complete guide.**\n\nLast year’s [Samsung Galaxy S7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-\ngalaxy-s7-review) was a truly wondrous phone, bagging itself a perfect 5/5\nscore from _TrustedReviews_. We even gave it our Phone of the Year award for\n2016, so enamoured were we with its design, performance and value for money.\n\nBut with the blip of the fiery Galaxy Note 7, and tough competition from the\niPhone 7, Samsung has had to return to the drawing board to create something\ntruly special in the Samsung Galaxy S8. We haven’t finished our full review of\nthe phone just yet, but so far we’re impressed.\n\nIf you’re thinking about upgrading to Samsung’s latest flagship (due out April\n28), here are the key differences between the Galaxy S8 and S7, and the Galaxy\nS8+ and S7 Edge.\n\n_If you can’t be bothered to read the full article, we’ve included a short\nsummary of what you need to know at the bottom of this page._\n\n## Samsung Galaxy S8 vs Galaxy S7 Design – What’s the difference?\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S7 received top marks from us last year, and for the most\npart that perfect score was down to the slick and refined design.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nWhat’s most impressive is that Samsung has actually improved on the phone’s\ndesign with the Galaxy S8. Thanks to the introduction of what the company\nrefers to as an ‘Infinity Display’, where screen occupies almost all the space\non the front of the phone, resulting in an incredibly thin bezel.\n\nBy **moving the fingerprint sensor to the back of the phone** , Samsung has\nbeen able to fit much more display into **a body that’s only marginally\nlarger** than the Galaxy S7. For instance, the Samsung Galaxy S7 dimensions\nare as follows: 142.4 x 69.6 x 7.9mm, with a 5.1-inch screen. But the Galaxy\nS8, with a whopping 5.8-inch display, is only slightly bigger at 148.9 x 68.1\nx 8.0mm.\n\n![s8plusbeware\n15](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)_Samsung Galaxy S8_\n\nThe Galaxy S8 is seriously gorgeous, and looks very different from Samsung\nGalaxy flagship smartphones we’ve seen before. It’s a huge step up from the\nGalaxy S7 – and from the ill-fated Note 7, which we thought was a great phone\n(until it blew up). It’s also worth noting that **both the Galaxy S8 and S8+\nfeature Samsung’s curved ‘Edge’-style display** , which is why there’s no\nseparate phone with ‘Edge’ branding.\n\nThe Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ are heavier than their predecessors, weighing in\nat 155g and 175g respectively. That’s in contrast to the Galaxy S7 and S7\nEdge, which weighed 152g and 157g respectively. These weight increases are\nnegligible, although anyone used to owning a small, light handset (such as the\n4-inch iPhone SE) might struggle to get to grips with the Galaxy S8+.\n\nThe only other point worth noting is that the Samsung Galaxy S8 is available\nin the UK in **black, blue, and silver colour options** , although we’d be\nsurprised if more colours weren’t added over time.\n\n**Here’s our Mobile Editor Max Parker’s take on the new design:**\n\n_“While the backs are similar, it’s all-change around the front for the S8 –\nand boy is this a gorgeous phone. The sloping sides, a screen that stretches\nalmost to each corner of the phone, plus subtle colour choices combine to make\nthis the best-looking phone I’ve seen. The S7 was simple, but the S8 takes it\nto a whole different level_\n\n![samsung galaxy s7\n11](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg) Samsung Galaxy S7\n\n## Samsung Galaxy S8 vs Galaxy S7 Specs – How much more powerful is the Galaxy\nS8?\n\nAlthough the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ aren’t significantly larger than their\npredecessors, they both feature **a much larger display**. The Galaxy S8 uses\na **5.8-inch Super AMOLED panel** , while the Galaxy S8+ rocks an even bigger\n6.2-inch screen.\n\nWhat’s quirky about the displays is that they use a new, **wider 18.5:9 aspect\nratio** , which means they have a slightly odd QHD+ screen resolution of 2960\nx 1440 pixels. That’s higher than the 2560 x 1440 pixel display on the Galaxy\nS7 – but the result of the bigger panel is a lower pixel density – check out\nthe table below for specifics.\n\nThe good news is that Samsung has also **significantly upgraded the Galaxy\nS8’s processor**. The Galaxy S7 used either a Samsung-built Exynos 8990 or\nQualcomm’s Snapdragon 820, depending on your market. These chips were built on\na 14nm process, but the processors in Samsung’s new phones are built on a much\nmore efficient 10nm process.\n\nSamsung is claiming that the **new phone is 10% faster** , thanks to the\nQualcomm Snapdragon 835 or Exynos 8995 chip inside. Accompanying this is 4GB\nof RAM (unchanged) and 64GB of storage (up from 32GB).\n\n![s8plusbeware\n7](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)_Samsung Galaxy S8_\n\nFor photography, it’s **largely the same camera setup** as before. There’s a\n12-megapixel DualPixel shooter on the back of the phone, with a wide f/1.7\naperture and optical image stabilisation (OIS) to boot. The front camera\noffers **higher-resolution selfies than the Galaxy S7** (8-megapixels versus\n5-megapixels), as well as a f/1.7 aperture and autofocus.\n\nPerhaps the only notable camera change is the introduction of multi-frame\nimage processing. This means that the Galaxy S8 takes three images when you\nhit the shutter button, and uses the trio of snaps to reduce blur and sharpen\nyour shots.\n\nElsewhere, you still benefit from a waterproof body, wireless charging and an\nSD card slot. The micro-USB has been switched out for the more versatile USB\nType-C port, which is a carry-over from the Note 7. We’ve also seen the\naddition of an iris scanner, which is another feature taken from the Note.\n\n**Related:[Best Android apps](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-android-\napps_round-up)**  \n![samsung galaxy\ns7](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)_Samsung Galaxy S7_\n\nAs far as battery life is concerned, it’s too soon to tell. The **Galaxy S8\nuses the same 3,000mAh cell as the Galaxy S7** , while the Galaxy S8+’s\n3,500mAh battery is slightly smaller than the 3,600mAh cell inside the Galaxy\nS7 Edge. But given that the screen resolution hasn’t changed significantly,\nand that Samsung has introduced a much more efficient processor, we’d be\nsurprised if battery life wasn’t improved.\n\nSamsung’s new phones run on Google’s latest Android 7.0 Nougat operating\nsystem, which is the same as the software we’ve seen on the Galaxy S7.\nHowever, there have been a few tweaks, the most notable of which is the\naddition of Samsung’s custom Bixby digital assistant – think Siri, but by\nSamsung.\n\n**\n\n  \n**  \n**For a full spec comparison, check out the table below:**\n\n|  Samsung Galaxy S8 | Samsung Galaxy S7  \n---|---|---  \n**Screen** |  5.8 inches (Super AMOLED) | 5.1 inches (Super AMOLED)  \n**Display Resolution** |  2960 x 1440 (567ppi) | 2560 x 1440 (577ppi)  \n**Aspect Ratio** |  18.5:9 | 16:9  \n**Primary Camera** |  12 megapixels | f/1.7 | OIS | 12 megapixels | f/1.7 |\nOIS  \n**Secondary Camera** |  8 megapixels | f/1.7 | AF | 5 megapixels | f/1.7  \n**Chipset** |  Snapdragon 835 (10nm) or Exynos 8995 (10nm) | Snapdragon 820\n(14nm) or Exynos 8990 (14nm)  \n**RAM** |  4GB | 4GB  \n**Storage** |  64GB | 32GB  \n**Battery Capacity** |  3000mAh | 3000mAh  \n**Waterproof?** |  Yes (IP68 certified) | Yes (IP68 certified)  \n**Fingerprint Scanner?** |  Yes | Yes  \n**Headphone Jack?** |  Yes | Yes  \n**Primary Port** |  USB Type C | Micro USB  \n**Iris Scanner?** |  Yes | No  \n**Wireless Charging?** |  Yes | Yes  \n**Micro SD Slot?** |  Yes | Yes  \n**Dimensions** |  148.9 x 68.1 x 8.0mm | 142.4 x 69.6 x 7.9mm  \n**Weight** |  155g | 152g  \n**Software** |  Android 7.0 Nougat | Android 7.0 Nougat  \n  \n**Related:[Best Samsung S7 deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/best-\nsamsung-galaxy-s7-deals)**\n\n## Samsung Galaxy S8 vs Galaxy S7 Price – Which phone is better value for\nmoney?\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S7 launched at a manageable £569 last year. Unfortunately,\nthe new Galaxy S8 pricing is far higher.\n\nSamsung has confirmed that the Galaxy S8 will start from £689, while the\nGalaxy S8+ will cost an even loftier £779.\n\n![s8plusbeware\n25](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)_Samsung Galaxy S8_\n\nIt’s important to remember that since last year, we’ve seen the value of the\nBritish pound plummet, which means many gadgets are selling for prices far\nhigher than we’ve seen before. Apple’s iPhone 7 retailed at £70 more than its\npredecessor, and the LG G6 is expected to make a similar price jump over the\nLG G5.\n\nGiven the fact that the Galaxy S8 is introducing mainly cosmetic changes, with\na few nice additional features over the Galaxy S7, it could be worth picking\nup last year’s Samsung flagship. If you’re in the market for a new phone, you\ncan grab a Galaxy S7 for around £450, and that price is sure to fall once the\nGalaxy S8 drops in April.\n\n**Related:[Best smartphones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-\nsmartphone_round-up)**  \n![samsung galaxy s7\n7](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)_Samsung Galaxy S7_\n\n## Samsung Galaxy S8 vs Galaxy S7 Summary – What’s the difference?\n\nHere’s what you need to know about the Samsung Galaxy S8, and how it’s\ndifferent from the Galaxy S7.\n\n**Design:** With an all-screen front, the Galaxy S8 offers a marked (and\nseriously sexy) departure from the already stylish Galaxy S7. It’s slim,\nmodern and suitably attractive for a top-end smartphone.\n\n**Specs:** The Galaxy S8 ushers in an ‘Edge’-style QHD+ screen, a nippy 10nm\nprocessor, as well as bonus features such as an iris scanner, USB Type-C and a\nrear-mounted fingerprint sensor. We’ve also seen a bump up in storage to 64GB\nas standard.\n\n**Price:** The Samsung Galaxy S8 will cost £689 and the S8+ £779.\n\n**Value:** The Samsung Galaxy S8 costs over £200 more than a Galaxy S7\ncurrently, so if you’re not concerned about the bleeding-edge specs, then the\nS7 may be the way to go.\n\n**Tell us what you think of the new Samsung Galaxy S8 and Samsung Galaxy S8+\nin the comments below.**\n\n"}
