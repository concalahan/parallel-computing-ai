The smart home speaker has been trained to recognise\nten of Disney’s most popular stories and will add a range of corresponding\nsound effects in-sync with the book.**\n\nAll users need to do is say: “Hey Google, let’s read along with Disney” and\nthe Home speaker will use its voice recognition nous to spring into action\nwhen you begin reading the text. So, for example, when Tinker Bell arrives on\nthe scene in Peter Pan, youngsters may hear the sprinkling of fairy dust.\n\nThe supported titles are: Mickey’s Christmas Carol, The Three Little Pigs,\nAlice in Wonderland, Cinderella, Coco, Jack Jack Attack, Mickey Mouse and His\nSpaceship, Moana, Toy Story 3 and Peter Pan.\n\n“We hope that it’s something that parents will do with their kids each and\nevery day,” Kelsey Gliva, Google Home product marketing manager, told\n[Adweek](https://www.adweek.com/digital/google-home-brings-sound-effects-and-\nmusic-to-disney-childrens-books/) (via\n[VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/2018/10/29/google-home-taps-disney-for-\nchildrens-books/)).\n\n“As we look to the future, thinking about the context of the family and ways\nthat we can enhance routines that they already do is something that we’re\nreally interested in. We know that parents and their kids are sort of fearless\nwhen it comes to assistant technology — they ask lots of questions and they\nengage, and we know with Disney’s iconic character voices, it’s a really\nfantastic way to bring this to life. So it’s a no-brainer to continue working\nwith them.”\n\n**Related:[Google Home Hub vs Amazon Echo\nShow](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-home-hub-vs-amazon-echo-\nshow-3602099)**\n\nThe integration is certainly a lot more involved than the previous bedtime\nstory feature which didn’t require parents to be present. The Apps For\nFamilies Assistant-based skill can read stories like Wallace & Gromit to the\nkids and launched in the UK in July this year.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n**Will the New Disney integration brighten-up bedtime for your wee ones?
