We went\nhands-on with [Ashe](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/gaming/overwatch-\nashe-release-date-3614718), the brand-new hero for\n[Overwatch](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/overwatch) and also had a\nchance to [chat with the team](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/overwatch-\nsix-heroes-works-set-improve-cast-diversity-3614909) about the roster’s\ndiversity. We also dove into [Diablo\nImmortal](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/diablo-immortal-release-\ndate-3614896) for iOS and Android before dying a lot as\n[Orphea](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/heroes-of-the-storm-orphea-\nrelease-date-abilities-3614922) in Heroes of the Storm.\n\nThis year saw an abundance of great announcements for all of Blizzard’s\nflagship titles. But, more importantly, it also had thousands of fans come\ntogether to celebrate everything they love about Blizzard Entertainment.\nObviously, some of them are deviously creative and rock up in some of the\nfinest cosplay imaginable purely to express their love for certain outfits and\ncharacters. We sadly didn’t a chance to dress up but did manage to snap a few\npictures of those who did.\n\n**_Trusted Reviews_ has compiled some of the cosplay from BlizzCon 2018\nincluding characters from Overwatch, World of Warcraft and more!**\n\n![BlizzCon\nCosplay](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSoldier 76 and Punk Tracer.\n\n![BlizzCon\nCosplay](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nA spot on Valeera Sanguinar, replete with glowing daggers.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n![BlizzCon\nCosplay](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nTeam Talon are on their day off it seems.\n\n![BlizzCon\nCosplay](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAntarctic Mei is absurdly adorable!\n\n![BlizzCon\nCosplay](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nImp Mercy is up to something…\n\n![BlizzCon\nCosplay](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nKaka!\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nA Pharmercy combo in the wild.
