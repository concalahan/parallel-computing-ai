Google Home Hub pulls in the full power of Google's services, but this\nisn't the best display for video and music.\n\n## Pros\n\n  * Easy to converse with\n  * Touchscreen displays extra information\n  * Dedicated smart home controls\n  * Integrated YouTube\n\n## Cons\n\n  * Doesn't like G Suite accounts\n  * Can't play Netflix\n  * No webcam\n\n## Key Features\n\n  * Review Price: £139\n  * Built-in Google Assistant support\n  * Bluetooth\n  * 7-inch LCD touchscreen\n  * Single 'full-range' speaker\n\n## What is the Google Home Hub?\n\nWith the Amazon Echo Show proving that the adding a display to a smart speaker\ndramatically increased usability, it was never going to be long before Google\nbrought out its rival. With the Google Home Hub, we finally have significant\ncompetition for Amazon, with a smartly-designed, well-thought-out smart\ndisplay.\n\nQuality smart home controls, integrated YouTube, and a brilliant use of the\ndisplay to give access to some Google services, such as Maps and Photos make\nthis model better than the Echo Show in some regards. Restrictive Google\nAccount support and the inability to play\n[Netflix](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/netflix-4k-ultra-hd) restrict\nthe appeal slightly.\n\n**Buy Now:[Google Home Hub at Ebay from\n£199](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/710-53481-19255-0/1?ff3=4&pub=5574857717&toolid=10001&campid=5338361201&customid=&mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.co.uk%2Fitm%2FBoxed-\nSealed-Google-Home-Hub-Smart-Display-Speaker-Worldwide-\nShipping%2F123443631115%3F)**\n\n## Google Home Hub – Design and build quality\n\nGoogle has worked hard coming up with a common design language for its more\nrecent products, combining soft-touch plastic and material across its range,\nfrom the [Google Home Mini](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-\nhome-mini) to the new [Nest Thermostat\nE](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/redesigned-nest-thermostat-e-comes-uk-\npre-programmed-smart-schedule-3596448) (a company owned by Google).\n\nIt’s no surprise to see that the Google Home Hub is designed along the same\nlines, with a display hanging off the material base. It’s a big step up from\nthe chunky original Echo Show and a bit nicer to look at than the [Echo\nShow](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/amazon-echo-show) (2nd Gen).\n\n![Google Home Hub\nside](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nWith a 7-inch screen, the Google Home Hub looks tiny (179 x 118 x 67mm). With\nvery thin bezels all around the screen adding to the effect; the original Echo\nShow had the same-size screen but looks massive in comparison.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Acer Predator Orion 9000\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/acer-predator-orion-9000 \"Acer\nPredator Orion 9000\")\n\n  * [ ![ipad pro 2018 leak](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Image Credit: @VenyaGeskin1/Twitter \n\n### New iPad Pro 2018 leaks suggest Apple will drop the Home button but keep\nthings notchless\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ipad-pro-2018-release-date-specs-\nprice-3482812 \"New iPad Pro 2018 leaks suggest Apple will drop the Home button\nbut keep things notchless\")\n\n  *   * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### MacBook Air 2018: Retina display and mini bezels tipped for new ‘entry-\nlevel’ model\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/new-macbook-air-2018-release-\ndate-3433474 \"MacBook Air 2018: Retina display and mini bezels tipped for new\n‘entry-level’ model\")\n\n  * \n\n![Google Home\nHub](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAround the back of the screen, there are dedicated volume buttons and a switch\nthat turns of the microphone to stop the Home Hub from listening in. For\nsound, you can just swipe up from the bottom of the display and use the touch\ncontrols instead.\n\n![Google Home\nHub](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThere’s no webcam on this model, with Google deciding that it wanted privacy\nfirst and foremost, giving people the confidence to place the Home Hub\nwherever they wanted. For night time the light sensor automatically turns the\nscreen off when it gets dark, so you won’t get disturbed if you use the Home\nHub as a kind of smart alarm clock.\n\nGiven the muck thrown at the [Facebook\nPortal](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/facebook-portal-smart-\nspeaker-3461010) smart display, you can’t help think that Google may have just\nscored some valuable Brownie points here. Although, a sliding physical shutter\nacross a webcam could have achieved the same privacy effect, without removing\nfeatures, as with the Lenovo Smart Display.\n\nTwo far-field microphones sit on top of the display, primed to listen for your\nvoice commands. Quality is pretty good, although I found that I occasionally\nhad to move a little closer to the display in my kitchen when I wanted to talk\nto Google.\n\n## Google Home Hub – Features\n\nBuilding a smart display is more than just whacking a screen on a smart\nspeaker and taking it from there. It’s about creating a new interface,\ncombining sight, speech and touch. From this point of view, Google has nailed\nwhat it is to have a smart display. In my [Google Assistant\nguide](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/google-asssistant-guide-\nfeatures-entertainment-smart-home-and-more-3462823), I’ve covered everything\nin more detail, but I’ll cover the specific points for the Home Hub here.\n\nFirst, it’s worth re-iterating that the Google Home Hub doesn’t support G\nSuite (paid-for) accounts for email, calendar appointments or Google Photos.\nThis has been a problem since launch and means that if you pay for your Google\nservices you’re effectively getting penalised. Given that the Echo range of\nproducts can access G Suite accounts, there’s no technical limitation, just\none that Google has artificially introduced.\n\nFrom the home screen, you can see the current weather and a list of news\nheadlines. You can tap either of these to get more information, all without\nhaving to use your voice. Swipe on the screen, and you can view music and\nsuggested YouTube videos. Do anything on screen, and you can swipe back to the\nhome screen; cleverly, the current content appears in a window, so you can\nswitch back to it when you want.\n\n![Google Home\nHub](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nGoogle services work brilliantly on the Home Hub. Ask for directions, for\nexample, and you get a map on-screen showing you the route. As with the voice-\nonly Google products, directions are also sent to your phone, too. Other\nsearch results have been formatted for the screen, too, including recent\nfootball scores, or illustrating a search with a photo.\n\nAs the Home Hub is powered by Google search, it’s far more accurate when\nfinding local businesses and answering generic questions than the Echo\ndevices. Google is also more conversational and doesn’t need quite the same\nrigid use of language that Alexa does.\n\nThird-party services are available, such as to give you Tube line status\nupdates, but you can’t see or install the list of skills; rather, when you ask\na question, Google will ask if you want to use a third-party skill to answer.\n\nIf you have an account that works with Photos, the Home Hub can display images\nautomatically on the lock screen turning your smart display into a digital\nphoto frame. You can, of course, use your voice to view specific photos and\nalbums, too.\n\nYouTube is built-in, which is great for watching all kinds of videos,\nincluding instructional videos. Touch controls on the screen let you pause and\nscrub through the content. And, you can cast from your phone, too.\n\n![Google Home\nHub](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe Google Home Hub is not a full Chromecast device, so you can’t stream\nNetflix to the display, for example. That’s a bit of a shame, as the rival\nEcho Show lets you watch Amazon Prime Video content.\n\nYou can play music using\n[Spotify](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/spotify-premium),\n[Deezer](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/deezer-music), [Google Play\nMusic](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-play-music-all-access) or\n[YouTube Music](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/youtube-music), with\nthe screen even showing you suggested music. You can group multiple speakers,\nbut if you want to play different tracks on different smart speakers, you’ll\nneed a YouTube Music Family account.\n\nRecipes are built in, with the Home Hub giving multiple results for each\nsearch. Generally, the results are spot on, too, with Google delivering better\nresults than the Echo Show. Some recipes are American, mind, so you have to\nget your head around odd measurements, such as a quart.\n\n![Google Home\nHub](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCalls are built into the Home Hub, letting you make free calls to UK numbers.\nAnd, if you set your mobile number in the app, caller ID even works properly.\nYou can now make Google Duo calls over the internet; as the Home Hub doesn’t\nhave a camera, you can’t make video calls, although other smart displays with\ncameras can.\n\nRelated: [How to make hands-free voice calls with Google\nHome](https://www.trustedreviews.com/how-to/make-hands-free-voice-calls-\ngoogle-home-3415441)\n\n## Google Home Hub – Smart Home\n\nSmart Home is the one area where Google has made plenty of strides this year.\nFor starters, the number of supported devices has grown exponentially. Google\nis still a little behind the Amazon Echo for the total number of supported\ndevices (there’s no Dyson Link option for controlling the likes of the [Dyson\n360 Eye](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/dyson-360-eye), for example),\nbut it’s very close.\n\nGoogle has recently brought custom Routines to everywhere in the world, after\nan initial US roll-out. Routines let you control several devices at once with\na single voice command, say making it easy to shut down your home when you go\nout.\n\n**Related:[How to create Google Home\nroutines](https://www.trustedreviews.com/how-to/create-google-home-\nroutines-3607768)**\n\nGoogle has overhauled and revamped the way that you can interact with smart\ndevices in your home. From the Home Hub, you can swipe down from the top of\nthe screen to show Home View. From here you can tap and control lights,\nthermostats and view cameras.\n\n![Google Home\nHub](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nNeatly, with the likes of [Philips\nHue](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/philips-hue), Home View can be\nused to change bulb colour as well as the brightness and toggling lights on\nand off. This is something that the Echo Show can’t do, only giving you on/off\nand brightness controls. The Google Home Hub also has better support for\nthermostats, and even let me change individual rooms with [Honeywell\nEvohome,](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/honeywell-evohome) something\nthat the Echo Show can’t do.\n\nSmartly, if you use your voice to change a thermostat or light, the Home Hub\nshow the touch controls on the screen. For example, you can turn your kitchen\nlights on and then use the touch controls to pick the exact brightness you\nwant.\n\nHome View is also available in the Google Home app, giving roughly the same\nlevel of control, although it doesn’t currently let you change bulb colour,\nwhich is a little strange.\n\n![Google Home\nHub](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIf you have a [Nest Hello](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nest-hello)\ndoorbell, the Google Home Hub now displays the video feed alongside an audible\nannouncement when someone presses the button. At the time of writing, the only\noption is to Ignore the call, but a future update will let you respond to the\nring without having to touch your phone. For other supported cameras, you can\nview the video stream, which is still a handy way to keep an eye on what’s\ngoing on.\n\n![Google Home\nHub](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Google Home Hub – Sound quality\n\nGoogle describes the Home Hub as having a full range speaker, but there’s no\nmore information than that. It’s safe to say that this isn’t a smart speaker\nin the same vein as the Google Home Max or even the Echo Show.\n\nAudio is better tuned for voice responses and YouTube video than music. I\nfound the Google Home Hub loud and clear. There’s a hint of bass, but\ncertainly not enough to bring the excitement and pump to music or films. The\nrange is somewhat compressed, too, so you don’t hear the subtleties in music\ntracks.\n\nUltimately, the Home Hub isn’t designed for music, TV shows or films, and if\nyou want a smart display with a bit more oomph, the Echo Show (2nd Gen) is a\nbetter choice.\n\n## Google Home Hub – Video quality\n\nBeyond stating that the Home Hub has a 7-inch touchscreen, there are no more\nspecs. That said, the quality of the display is excellent. Sharp, clear and\nwith decent contrast, it has been well tuned for the touch interface and\nYouTube video.\n\nViewing angles are great, and the image quality maintains whether you’re\nlooming above the screen or stood to the side. With the light-sensor built\ninto the screen, Ambient EQ adjusts the colour temperature of the display to\nmatch the ambient lighting. It does a decent job and the Home Hub’s screen\nalways looks natural.\n\n**Buy Now:[Google Home Hub at Ebay from\n£199](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/710-53481-19255-0/1?ff3=4&pub=5574857717&toolid=10001&campid=5338361201&customid=&mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.co.uk%2Fitm%2FBoxed-\nSealed-Google-Home-Hub-Smart-Display-Speaker-Worldwide-\nShipping%2F123443631115%3F)**\n\n## Why buy the Google Home Hub?\n\nThe Google Home Hub (and third-party smart displays) fill in a gap with the\nGoogle Assistant. Having video, pictures and a touchscreen display, as well as\nvoice responses, is a compelling package.\n\nWith the power of Google Search and Maps, the Home Hub gives more nuanced and\nuseful responses to many searches than Alexa does.\n\n![Google Home\nHub](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nI love the new Home View option, with the ability to control your smart home\nwith touch as well as voice increasing the options available. With Google\ncatching up with Alexa regarding the range of supported devices, the Google\nHome Hub is a smart home device that will suit the majority of people.\n\nYet, there are still some frustrations. YouTube support is great, but why not\nhave full Chromecast support to send content from Netflix (Amazon Prime Video\nisn’t Chromecast enabled)? And, the lack of support for G Suite accounts is a\ncontinued annoyance for some people.\n\nWhen it comes to media and music, the Echo Show (2nd Gen) is a better choice;\nfor general voice assistant duties and direct smart home control, I’d go with\nthe Home Hub.\n\n## Score\n\n  \n\n"}
