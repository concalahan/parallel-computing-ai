You can now also have group call in FaceTime.Thanks to the Face ID system, there’s Animoji and Memoji on the iPhone XR.These augmented reality emojis blend your facial animations with variouscharacters and can be pretty addictive. They’re limited to iMessage, whichseems odd. Surely there must be plans to brand them off into a singular app?Due to the lack of a physical home button, your main interaction with theiPhone XR is through a selection of gestures. Swipe up from the bottom to goto the Home Screen, pull down from the top left for notifications and topright for Control Center. Once you’ve got over the initial learning curve,it’s mostly a straightforward process.[ Next  Camera ](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xr-camera)"}
