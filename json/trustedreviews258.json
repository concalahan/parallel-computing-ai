Today, a single Bitcoin is valued at £305.\nThat’s significant growth compared to the £0.05 value it held in June 2010, so\nthere’s no denying the currency has seen some success.\n\nBut one obvious question remained: who is Satoshi Nakamoto?\n\nOn May 2, 2016, that question seemed to have finally been\n[answered](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/bitcoin-inventor-finally-\nconfirmed).\n\n![Bitcoin](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \n**Related:[What is Bitcoin?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/what-is-\nbitcoin)**\n\n## Who is Satoshi Nakamoto?\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto first entered public consciousness when he published his\noriginal paper, and subsequently went on to work with other developers to\nimplement Bitcoin.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nBut no one really knew who he was, much to the chagrin of journalists.\n\nThe mystery was especially compelling because Nakamoto was known – thanks to\nthe public Bitcoin transaction log – to be holding around $415 million worth\nof Bitcoin.\n\nIn 2012, Nakamoto’s P2P Foundation profile had him listed as a 37-year-old\nmale living in Japan. However, Nakamoto’s perfect English led some to suspect\nthat the biography wasn’t legitimate.\n\nThen on March 6, 2014, US magazine Newsweek seemingly revealed Nakamoto’s true\nidentity. An article identified a Japanese American man living in California\nwhose birth name was Satoshi Nakamoto. A number of circumstantial pieces of\nevidence suggested it was this Nakamoto that invented Bitcoin.\n\n![dorian\nnakamoto](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto, of California, USA\n– not the inventor of Bitcoin\n\nFor instance, Newsweek’s Nakamoto was trained as a physicist, worked as a\nsystems engineer and computer engineer, and had been employed by financial\ninformation services companies.\n\nNakamoto was hounded by press, but denied any involvement in Bitcoin. On the\nday of publication, the real Nakamoto’s P2P Foundation account posted a\nmessage – after five years of silence – confirming that the Californian\nNakamoto wasn’t the inventor of Bitcoin.\n\nLittle progress was made toward identifying Nakamoto for a while, until in\nDecember 2015, Wired reported that an Australian man named Craig Steven Wright\n“either invented Bitcoin or is a brilliant hoaxer who very badly wants us to\nbelieve he did”.\n\nIt looks like it turned out to be true.\n\n## Who is Craig Wright?\n\nOn May 2, 2016, Craig Wright finally admitted that he invented Bitcoin under\nthe pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto. Wright revealed the truth to the\n[BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36168863), the Economist, and GQ.\nAccording to Wright, his alias was inspired by 18th Century Japanese\nphilosopher Tominaga Nakamoto.\n\nCraig Wright was born in October 1970 in Brisbane, Australia. In his early\nlife, he held a research and lecturing position in computer science at Charles\nSturt University, and holds a PhD in theology.\n\n![bitcoin\ncreator](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)Craig Wright, during an interview with the BBC\n\nDuring Wright’s career, he worked in IT at various companies, including\nOzEmail, K-Mart, and the Australian Securities Exchange. He also designed the\narchitecture for what may have been the world’s first online casino –\nLasseter’s Online, launched in 1999.\n\nHe went on to become the CEO of a technology firm called Hotwire PE, and\nfounded cryptocurrency company DeMorgan Ltd. The 45-year-old is also the\nfounder of Panopticrypt Pty Ltd., which is a cybersecurity and computer\nforensics company.\n\n**Related:[Best VPN 2016](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/best-free-\nvpn-services)**\n\n## Is there any proof?\n\nCraig Wright invited members of the press – and Bitcoin experts – to “proof\nsessions” in London, where he digitally signed messages using cryptographic\nkeys that were created in the early days of Bitcoin’s development, according\nto the BBC.\n\nThose keys are “inextricably linked” to the blocks of Bitcoin that we already\nknow were mined (read: created) by Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\n“These are the blocks used to send 10 Bitcoins to Hal Finney in January [2009]\nas the first Bitcoin transaction,” Wright was quoted as saying. “I was the\nmain part of it, but other people helped me.”\n\nHe also published a [blog post](http://www.drcraigwright.net/jean-paul-sartre-\nsigning-significance/), detailing how it’s possible to verify a set of\ncryptographic keys, and said: “Satoshi is dead.”\n\n![Bitcoin](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nHe continued: “Since those early days, after distancing myself from the public\npersona that was Satoshi, I have poured every measure of myself into research\nI have been silent, but I have not been absent. I have been engaged with an\nexceptional group and look forward to sharing our remarkable work when they\nare ready.”\n\nAfter the revelation, a number of high-profile members of the Bitcoin\ncommunity spoke out in support of Wright’s claims.\n\nGavin Andresen, chief scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation, published a [blog\npost](http://gavinandresen.ninja/satoshi), which states: “I believe Craig\nSteven Wright is the person invented Bitcoin.”\n\nThe BBC reports Jon Matonis, an economist and a founding director of the\nBitcoin Foundation as saying:\n\n“During the London proof sessions, I had the opportunity to review the\nrelevant data along three distinct lines: cryptographic, social, and\ntechnical. It is my firm belief that Craig Wright satisfies all three\ncategories.”\n\n**Have you ever used Bitcoin? Tell us what you think about the cryptocurrency\nin the comments below.**\n\n"}
