But that’s exactly the big newchange to come in Madden NFL 19 and, despite its questionable name, it reallyhas changed almost every aspect of the experience.The fancy real player motion tag is really just a good way of grouping a lotof subtle changes together, but when you start to break it down it becomesclear just how impactful these changes are, and how they create the mostrealistic and satisfying Madden yet. After switching to the Frostbite enginelast year, the team has reformed the physical side of things, which hasresulted in better control over the run game, top players having signaturestyles and actions, and of course some much bigger hits.With new rules coming in to better protect players in the real NFL, it seems alittle strange that the Madden team would make big hits feel as good as theydo, but smashing into a running back who tried to make a big cut with a full-speed linebacker is insanely satisfying. With tons of new animation optionsfor tackles you never really feel like you were unfairly brought to theground.**Related:[Best PS4Games]()The real surprise of Madden 19 is just how good it’s story-driven Longshotmode is once again. Last year was great, but this time it’s even better, whichis quite the achievement. The story picks up quite a while after the close oflast year’s offering, but we are still following Devin Wade, who starts outbattling for a place on the Cowboys’ roster, and Colt Cruise, whose NFL dreamsseem to be on their last legs as things start out. Throughout the course ofthe story multiple twists and turns, along with some genuinely likeablecharacters, will keep you glued to your seat, and there’s a good chance you’llplay through it in one sitting.Without getting into spoiler territory the high school games are the undoubtedhighlight, thanks to the totally different setting and brilliant commentatorswho are significantly more entertaining than the standard commentary team whoreuse lines constantly. There are a few emotional punches that do have animpact and some twists that are genuine surprises.A few scenes are a little cliché, the big bad guy really doesn’t seem like acredible threat, and Devin’s story seems to disappear for most of the secondact, but these are all minor issues in what is a thoroughly enjoyable fewhours, and easily the best story any sports game has ever produced. It’s justa shame that you will have to rely on the questionable AI when playing asDevin, which can lead to a few frustrating moments.**VERDICT**There’s enough in terms of one field changes to make this feel like asubstantially different game to Madden NFL 18, and all of those changes arefor the better, with collisions and running being much improved. There arestill occasional physics issues but they are greatly reduced, and playingfeels incredibly satisfying most of the time.Off the field, improvements are severely lacking, with only minor additions toFranchise and Ultimate Team, but for most that won’t matter as the core ofthese modes can keep you entertained well past the Super Bowl. Longshot isonce again the star of the show, great big-name cameos and a story you willgenuinely care about make this a must play for everyone who picks up Maddenthis year.Madden NFL 19 is much more than a roster update, but if you were hoping forsweeping changes off the field you will be very disappointed.## Score"}
