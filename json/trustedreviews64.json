Fortunately, one intrepid user seems to have found an iPhone workaround\nthat lets you undo the dreaded February 2018 Snapchat update. Here’s what to\ntry if you want to get rid of the new Snapchat and revert to the old version\ntoday.**\n\nIt seemed like all hope was lost if you’d updated to the new version of\nSnapchat, but now it looks like there might be a functioning workaround – at\nleast on certain iPhones and potentially other iOS devices.\n\n_Mashable_[spotted](https://mashable.com/2018/02/10/snapchat-old-version-\nswitch-utility/#v1Rpwi6Y0mqq) a tweet by @clairejamess9, which offers step-by-\nstep instructions on how to revert to the old Snapchat. Just delete Snapchat,\nre-install it from scratch, input your email, and then say you’ve forgotten\nyour password. Opt to reset it via your phone, follow the prompts, and you\nshould find yourself back with the 2017 version of the app.\n\n**Related:[How to delete Facebook](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-\ndelete-facebook-account-2950145)**\n\n> PSA: how to reverse the Snapchat update ‼️\n[pic.twitter.com/EN2wY3Xo5S](https://t.co/EN2wY3Xo5S)\n\n>\n\n> — clare james (@clarejamess9) [February 9,\n2018](https://twitter.com/clarejamess9/status/962004840414027776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Call of Cthulhu](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Call of Cthulhu\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/call-of-cthulhu \"Call of Cthulhu\")\n\n  * [ ![iPad Pro 2018](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: MySmartPrice / @OnLeaks \n\n### New iPad Pro 2018 leak shows Apple is almost certainly dropping the Home\nbutton\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ipad-pro-2018-release-date-specs-\nprice-3482812 \"New iPad Pro 2018 leak shows Apple is almost certainly dropping\nthe Home button\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Pete Lau on stage at the OnePlus 6T launch](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### The OnePlus 6T ditched the headphone jack, CEO Pete Lau tells us why\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ceo-pete-lau-oneplus-6t-headphone-jack-\nwireless-charging-3612475 \"The OnePlus 6T ditched the headphone jack, CEO Pete\nLau tells us why\")\n\n  * \n\nWe haven’t been able to test this ourselves just yet but the ‘forgot password’\ntrick is a fairly common workaround that we’ve used successfully in other\nsituations, so it’s definitely worth a shot. The folks at _Lifehacker_ also\nsay they’ve successfully implemented the method and have a strong track record\nwhen it comes to such things.\n\nThat said, Snapchat may have already patched things up, so act fast if you\nwant to give it a whirl.\n\nFailing that, here’s [how to disable automatic Snapchat\nupdates](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/new-snapchat-turn-off-automatic-\nupdates-iphone-android-3390221) so you don’t fall foul of unwanted changes in\nthe future.
