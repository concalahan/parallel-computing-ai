Now we finally have the full details on the new\nchips, including how they’ll bring gaming to thin and light laptops.**\n\nBranded G-series, the new chips will use the existing H-series enthusiast\nmobile CPUs, combined with Radeon RX Vega M onboard graphics in a single\npackage.\n\nPowering the technology is the Intel Embedded Multi-Die Interconnect Bridge\n(EMIB), which joins the chips together. As a result of using EMIB, Intel is\nclaiming a 50% reduction in footprint compared to using discrete memory; and\nthe G-series chip is thin at just 1.7mm thick.\n\nThe net result is a package that can fit into very slim laptops, with Intel\npromising high performance and smooth gaming in light computers.\n\nIntel has joined its CPU to the GPU using an 8-lane PCIe 3.0 connector. And,\nthe GPU uses 4GB of High Bandwidth Memory (HBM2), which is far more power\nefficient compared to GDDR5.\n\n**Related:[Best GPU](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-graphics-\ncard)**\n\n## GPU specs\n\nDepending on the chip, the RX Vega M GPU can have up to 24 compute units, and\nsupports [Vulkan](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/what-is-\nvulkan-2946841) and DirectX 12. Its integrated Radeon Display Engine supports\nup to six displays, with support for 4K via DisplayPort 1.4 and HDMI 2.0b.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nAs well as the Radeon GPU, there’s an Intel GPU onboard, too. Using Hybrid\ngraphics, systems will be able to switch between the two chips, optimising for\nbattery life or performance, depending on need.\n\n## Power saving\n\nUsing EMIB, Intel has been able to fine-tune power saving, too. With Intel\nDynamic Tuning, components can be tuned individually to hit a combined TDP. As\na result, according to Intel’s figures, Dynamic Tuning can save up to 17.5W,\nwhile running at the same frame rate as a system with Dynamic Tuning turned\noff. Effectively, this should deliver better battery life while gaming,\nalthough we’ll have to wait for the first set of products to see how effective\nDynamic Tuning really is.\n\n## Versions\n\nIntel will ship a Core i5 and Core i7 chip with RX VEga M GL graphics.\nAccording to the specs for the i7 variant, the chip will have four cores and\neight threads, and a clock speed up to 4.1GHz. The RX Vega GL graphics will\nhave a base speed of 931MHz, a boost speed of 1011MHz, 20 Compute Units and 32\npixels per clock. These chips have a 65W TDP.\n\nA higher-end Core i7 part will ship with an RX Vega GH Graphics chip. As well\nas the processor having a faster max clock speed of 4.2GHz, the GPU has a base\nspeed of 1063MHz, a boost speed of 1190MHz, 24 Compute Units and 64 pixels per\nclock. This chip has a higher 100W TDP.\n\nThis latter chip will be the model for enthusiasts, with unlocked CPU, GPU and\nHBM2, giving the flexibility to overclock each of the chip’s components.\n\nFull specs can be seen in the table below.\n\n**Related:[Best CPU](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/best-intel-\nprocessor-core-i3-i5-i7-2937692)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Performance\n\nJust how fast will the chips be? Intel’s presentation compared the G-Series\nperformance to three-year-old desktop computers, which doesn’t particularly\nsay much. However, there were some actual figures in the results to give an\nidea.\n\nRunning Rise of the Tomb Raider, Intel claims that the higher-end RX Vega M GH\nis capable of managing 62fps, while Hitman also delivered 62fps. The lower-end\nRX Vega M GL chip had no Tomb Raider results but managed a smooth 46fps in\nHitman.\n\nIn other words, the higher-end chip looks like a decent 1080p gaming platform,\nwhile the lower-end chip seems ideal for lighter gaming. For single combined\nCPU/GPU the results are impressive, especially when you think about the size\nof laptop that they’ll be installed in.\n\n**Related:[Best laptops](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-laptops)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Laptops\n\nIntel has some OEM partners lined up to take the new chips, with laptops ready\nto be announced over the next few days at CES. Stay tuned to find out details\nas they come in. Of course, we’ll bring you reviews to tell you how good the\nIntel G-Series really is as soon as products are available.\n\n"}
