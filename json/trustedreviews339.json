This allows the chip to\nswitch between four 1.2GHz cores for regular, low-intensity tasks, and four\n1.5GHz cores for advanced tasks.\n\nLG also boasts of the NUCLUN chip’s LTE-A Cat.6 network support, which is the\nnext generation of super-fast 4G connectivity bringing download speeds of up\nto 225Mbps.\n\n“NUCLUN opens up a new chapter in LG’s history of innovation in the mobile\nindustry,” said LG’s Dr. Jong-seok Park. “With this in-house solution, we will\nbe able to achieve better vertical integration and further [diversify] our\nproduct strategy against stronger competition. NUCLUN will give us greater\nflexibility in our mobile strategy going forward.”\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThe LG G3 Screen will be the first device to run on the NUCLUN chip, and if it\nappears to be rather low key in all of this, that’s because it appears to be a\nbit of a test run. The Screen will only be launched in the Korean market.\n\nAside from LG’s CPU with its LTE-A support, the LG G3 Screen sports a 5.9-inch\nFull HD IPS LCD display, a 13-megapixel camera, and 32GB of storage with a\nmicroSD slot for backup. According to LG, the LG G3 Screen “inherits the\ndesign language, camera and UX features of the popular [LG\nG3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/lg-g3-review).”\n\nWhether LG will be able to use the NUCLUN series to power a true flagship\nmodel in the wider market next year is unknown at this point.  \n **  \nRead More:[Best Mobile Phone 2014](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-\nsmartphone_round-up)**\n\n**Via:** [NDTV](http://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/lg-g3-screen-smartphone-\nwith-firms-new-nuclun-octa-core-soc-launched-611240)\n\n"}
