Moving in the direction of how people use and access music,\nthe LSX is a true wireless set-up from both source and and between speakers,\nall housed in a compact package.\n\nWireless connectivity extends to [Apple AirPlay\n2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/what-is-airplay-2-3502091) (from\nJanuary 19th), which will enable use of multiple LSXs in different rooms in\ntandem with Siri voice control integration. [Spotify\nConnect](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/spotify-premium) is supported,\nas is the [Tidal](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/tidal-premium-hi-fi-\nmaster-3516521) music streaming service through 2.4GHz/5GHz dual band wi-fi.\nThe speaker system also features Bluetooth 4.2 and aptX for high-quality\nstreaming.\n\nBut music isn’t the only goal for these speakers. At the back is a TOSLINK\nconnection for those looking to hook the LSX up to their flatscreen TVs (the\nLSX also comes with an AUX connector).\n\nAll this is driven by the same technology KEF has had great success with – the\nUniQ driver array. Here it works in concert with KEF’s Music Integrity Engine,\na collection of bespoke Digital Signal Processing algorithms that help deliver\n“transparent bass with great extension”.\n\nThere are four Class-D amplifiers, one for each drive unit alongside dedicated\nDACs. Audio files up to 96kHz/24bit are possible for the optional wired\nconnection, with the wireless connection having to settle for 48kHz/24bit\nplayback. The LSX can support files all the way up to 192kHz/24bit, though.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nSpeaker operation is done through KEF’s Control app, available on Android and\niOS. The app also allows the system to receive over-the-air firmware and\nfeature updates. Through the optional Stream app you can control Tidal and\nDLNA streaming.\n\nDesigned in a collaboration between KEF and industrial designer Michael Young,\nthe LSX comes in five colours (blue, black, maroon, olive and a glossy white\nfinish), and makes use of a luxury fabric from Danish textile manufacturer\nKvadrat. In our brief experience with the speaker, the material used makes it\nfeel very plush.\n\nThe KEF LSX Wireless system retails for £1000 and is available now from select\nstores. We’ll be looking to review it in the near future.\n\n**Are you excited by the LSX Wireless system? Share your thoughts with us on\nFacebook, or tweet at us @TrustedReviews**\n\n"}
