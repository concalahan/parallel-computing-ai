So much so\nthat I went from being a doubter to a believer almost instantly,” explained\nChaffin.\n\n“From another source who travels in more rarified circles than yours truly, I\nalso learned that a lot of people at the top in Silicon Valley consider it a\ngiven that Apple is working on a car.”\n\nHe then added he was close ‘to 100 per cent’ certain that Apple was attempting\nto build a car for the consumer market.\n\n**Related:** [Apple CarPlay review](https://www.trustedreviews.com/apple-\ncarplay-review)\n\nLast week, BI also reported that an Apple employee revealed Tesla employees\nwere ‘jumping ship’ to work at Apple.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n“Apple’s latest project is too exciting to pass up,” the employee told the\nsite. “I think it will change the landscape and give Tesla a run for its\nmoney.”\n\nUnfortunately, the difference between Apple working on a car at its Cupertino\nHQ, and then actually launching a car for retail is pretty huge.\n\nCompanies will often explore new technologies but hold back on releasing them\nto the market for any number of reasons.\n\nApple currently employs around 50 ex-Tesla staff, many of which were\nengineers.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that Apple has invested plenty of cash in its CarPlay\ntechnology, so the Tesla employees could in fact be stationed in the\nsoftware/aftermarket hardware department at the firm.\n\n"}
