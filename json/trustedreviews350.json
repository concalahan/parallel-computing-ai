Now users will see a\nsub-menu offering five new choices, enabling them to identify the type of spam\ninvolved. One of those options is: “the account tweeting this is fake.”\n\nTwitter then promises users it’ll investigate to see if the account in\nquestion violates the rules, while it’ll also block that account from\ninteracting with you in any way. The announcement was made today using the\nTwitter Safety account, and you can see how the tool works in the animated GIF\nbelow.\n\n> Activity that attempts to manipulate or disrupt Twitter’s service is not\nallowed. We remove this when we see it.\n\n>\n\n> You can now specify what type of spam you're seeing when you report,\nincluding fake accounts.

With more details to review, we’ll be adding more resources to\nour review processes.”\n\n**Related:[Best smartphones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nsmartphone-3431175)**\n\nThe action comes after Twitter admitted it lost overall users in the last\nquarter due to the number of fake accounts being purged from the site.\nNaturally, the President of the United States complained that he was unfairly\ntargeted in the purge, which cost him followers.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\n> Twitter has removed many people from my account and, more importantly, they\nhave seemingly done something that makes it much harder to join – they have\nstifled growth to a point where it is obvious to all.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) [October 26,\n2018](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1055822810940129283?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nThe firm deleted 70 million accounts in May and June with Trump dropping a\nreported 200,000 of his then 53 million following. As for making it much\nharder to join? Well, Twitter is simply attempting to ensure those who do are\nactual human beings.\n\nIn June, the [company\nexplained](https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/company/2018/how-\ntwitter-is-fighting-spam-and-malicious-automation.html): “To make it harder to\nregister spam accounts, **we’re also going to require new accounts to confirm\neither an email address or phone number when they sign up to Twitter.** This\nis an important change to defend against people who try to take advantage of\nour openness. We will be working closely with our Trust and Safety Council and\nother expert NGOs to ensure this change does not hurt someone in a high-risk\nenvironment where anonymity is important. Look for this to roll out later this\nyear.”\n\n**Did you lose followers when Twitter got rid of all of those fake and spammy\naccounts this summer? Is Trump being a massive baby again? No need to answer\nthe second one @TrustedReviews on Twitter. It’s rhetorical.**\n\n"}
