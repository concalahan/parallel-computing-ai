In addition, there is an error in the driver of the Adreno 430 GPU.”\n\nIt’s pretty late in the game for Qualcomm to be facing production problems,\nespecially since a bunch of smartphone manufacturers were hoping to launch\nphones with the chip built-in early next year.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nQualcomm’s Snapdragon 810 is an octa-core processor that makes use of 4 quad-\ncore A57s and 4 quad-core A53s.\n\nThe chip is 64-bit friendly, and promises to fully support a 4K ultra-HD\ndisplay – tempting accolades for smartphone makers.\n\nSamsung is in a fortunate position in that it has its own range of chips – the\nExynos series – that could just as well be plugged into an upcoming\nsmartphone, but Sony isn’t so fortunate.\n\nLG does have its own application processor – NUCLUN – but [it doesn’t seem\nboast the performance required](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-\nconfirms-own-nuclun-cpu-and-first-phone-to-be-powered-by-it) to power a\nflagship device to a Snapdragon standard.\n\n**Read More:** [iPad Pro: When will we actually see\nit?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ipad-pro-12-9-release-date-concepts-\nstylus-specs-and-rumours)\n\n"}
