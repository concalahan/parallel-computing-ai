Instead, however, Google launched a Nexus 9, skipping an\n8-inch device.\n\nWe still don’t have any information regarding the manufacturer of the mooted\nNexus 8 however, so it’s tough to make any guesses as to the device’s specs or\ndesign.\n\nDo you think Google is going to unveil three Nexus devices on September 29?\nLet us know in the comments.  \n **  \nCheck out our smartphone group test video below:**\n\n"}
