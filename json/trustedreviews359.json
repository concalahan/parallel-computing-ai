The new Fortnitemares event has a rather ample\nfour unlockable items, which includes an emoticon, a spray, a trail, and a\nrather nifty glider. But how do you go about unlocking each of the spooky new\nunlocks just in time for Halloween? _Trusted Reviews_ is here to help with a\nquick and easy walkthrough.\n\n## Fortnite Season 6 – Fornitemares Challenges Part 1\n\n**Destroy Cube Monsters 0/200**\n\nYou’ve got two options here. The first is land at the floating island, where\nyou’ll find large cube fragments, which in turn spawn cube monsters. The\nsecond option, just play the game. Small cube fragments spawn randomly so the\nchances of running into cube monsters just through play is going to be very\nhigh. Just make sure you arm yourself with the weapons you’re best with and\nlet rip when you see their ugly faces.\n\n**Deal damage with Assault Rifles or Pistols to Cube Monsters 0/5,000**\n\nWhile that seems like a lot of damage, it’s not too terrible. It’s just going\nto take a while. Getting a rocket launcher and firing into a group of monsters\nwill help make this quicker, but you can’t always find a rocket launcher. The\nbest bet would be 50v50 and drive around the map farming the cube fragments.\nShoot at the fragment a couple of times to spawn enemies, kill them, then\nrepeat until the fragment is destroyed. Then it’s just a case of driving\naround until you find another one and starting again.\n\n**Visit a Corrupted Area in Different Matches 0/7**\n\nThis should be easy enough, and thankfully it’s not visit seven in one match.\nYou can either land at a corrupted zone, or if it’s too hot, grab a\nquadcrasher and mosey on down later in the match.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Fortnite Guide: How to Complete the Fortnitemares Challenges\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/fortnite-guide-complete-fortnitemares-\nchallenges-3610226 \"Fortnite Guide: How to Complete the Fortnitemares\nChallenges\")\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Google Assistant’s new Roomba trick could allow Google map your home\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-assistant-irobot-roomba-3613603\n\"Google Assistant’s new Roomba trick could allow Google map your home\")\n\n  *   * [ ![uncharted lost legacy](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Best PS4 Games 2018: All the top titles that belong in your library\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-ps4-games-3431751 \"Best PS4 Games\n2018: All the top titles that belong in your library\")\n\n  * \n\n**Dance in front of Gargoyles 0/5**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAs always we’ve got a handy map and a few pointers to let you know where the\neasiest gargoyles are to find.\n\n  * **Haunted Castle**\n\nThis one’s a bit tricky to get to. Head to the Haunted Castle as you normally\nwould. Enter into the main courtyard area, mine down through the floor, and\nyour gargoyle will be attached to a small pillar in the centre of the room.\nYou can go around the outside and follow the steps down if you like, but for\nspeed, mining is quicker.\n\n  * **Tomato Temple**\n\nYou’ll find this gargoyle at the centre of Tomato Temple surrounded by four\nbroken, small walls.\n\n  * **Viking Village (Skyrim!)**\n\nYou know the Viking area south-east of Snobby Shores? Head there. In the\nlarger house at the back-left you’ll find a gargoyle waiting for you.\n\n**Related:[Best PS4 Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nps4-games-3431751)**\n\n![fortnite](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n  * **Small Crack**\n\nTo the west of Lazy Links, and south from the motel, is a crack in the ground.\nOnce you get there it’s hard to miss, so just head to the location and you’ll\nbe able to see it. Drop into the mini canyon and follow it down to the wooden\nmining area. Inside is your gargoyle and a chance at a chest spawn.\n\n  * **Mountain Top**\n\nLook to Flush Factory then aim for the mountain just a tad north. At the\nsummit, in front of a rock with a hanging lamp and a bin next to it, is your\nfinal gargoyle.\n\nReward – Green fire emoticon\n\n## Fortnite Season 6 – Fornitemares Challenges Part 2\n\n**Destroy Cube Fiends 0/150**\n\nHere’s a nice and simple challenge to kick off Part 2. Feel free to use\nwhichever weapon you prefer and this will fly by in a few matches. For ease,\nwe recommend using the minigun with a healthy amount of ammo. As soon as a new\nwave spawns, spray bullets everywhere, loot any ammo the monsters drop, then\nrepeat. Easy stuff.\n\n**Deal damage with Shotguns or SMGs to Cube Monsters 0/5000**\n\nDon’t worry, 5000 isn’t that much when you have four-to-five enemies spawning\nevery few seconds. If you’re going the shotgun route, aim for the tactical\nshotgun or the heavy due to their superior firerate. Whereas if you opt for\nSMGs, the standard SMGs have the best clip size, which comes in useful when\nshooting down multiple enemies at once.\n\n**Eliminate Opponents near corrupted areas 0/3**\n\nThere’s a chest challenge coming in part 3, which we can complete at the same\ntime as this one. Other people will be going to the corrupted zones, so rather\nthan looting up elsewhere and then charging over to a zone, head to the\ncorrupted area straight away. If you grab the chest first, chances are you’ll\nbe able to spin around and gun down other players with the same idea.\n\n**Destroy a Ghost Decoration in different Named Areas 0/7**\n\nHead to a named area, preferably with houses to get you started, and shoot or\nsmack some ghost decorations.\n\nReward – Deadfire spray\n\n**Related:[Best Nintendo Switch\nGames](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/nintendo-switch-games-3435122)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Fortnite Season 6 – Fornitemares Challenges Part 3\n\n**Destroy Cube Brutes 0/25**\n\nWhile brutes do take a little bit longer to drop compared to the normal cube\nfiends, it’s not enough for them to prove challenging. So long as you keep\nthem at range, and don’t let them get within thwacking distance, you’ll be\nfine.\n\n**Deal damage with Explosive Weapons to Cube Monsters 0/2000**\n\nOnly use the grenade launcher for this challenge if there’s nothing else\nabout. It’s not exactly the most accurate weapon in the game, eh? If you can,\ntry to grab a rocket launcher. Then, group up the enemies and let rip into the\nmiddle of them and watch as a sea of damage numbers float off their lifeless\nbodies.\n\n**Search Chests in Corrupted Areas 0/7**\n\nAs we previously mentioned, the key here is landing first. Jump early, fly\nlow, and you should arrive before other players. It’s also worth keeping in\nmind sometimes a chest spawns around the back of the cube fragment, so be sure\nto check there before you leave. You should be able to net between two and\nthree chests per zone with minimal fuss.\n\n**Stage 1: Visit Wailing Woods**\n\n**Stage 2: Visit Fatal Fields**\n\n**Stage 3: Visit Haunted Hills**\n\nAnother easy one to finish this set on. Land Wailing Woods first, then in the\nnext match head over to Fatal, before finally, in another different match,\nland at Haunted Hills.\n\nReward – New trail\n\n**Related:[Best Xbox One Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/xbox-one-\ngames-3435271)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Fortnite Season 6 – Fornitemares Challenges Part 4\n\n**Destroy Elite Cube Monsters 0/10**\n\nAs with the brutes, these guys take a few extra bullets to drop. What you’re\nlooking for is the glowing enemies, which look similar to the bog-standard\nskinny cube fiends but, as we said, glow.\n\n**Damage Cube Fragments 0/2500**\n\nAgain, don’t let the number fool you. Just head from corrupted zone to\ncorrupted zone blasting or pickaxing the cube spikes. They take longer to\ndestroy than your average enemy so if you can rope in a squad to help you out\nthis’ll get done much quicker.\n\n**Deal Damage to Cube Monsters in a single match 0/1000**\n\nAgain, again, it’s not a massive amount. Two rockets into a group of fiends\nwill complete this challenge, as will several well-placed headshots with a\nsniper or shotgun. If you can’t get it done at one zone, just head to another\nin the same match and the progress will carry over.\n\n**Visit Different Corrupted Areas in the single match 0/4**\n\nRight. Okay. Normally these challenges are a ballache, but, thanks to the\nintroduction of the quadcrasher, they’re now a cakewalk. Drop in Salty Springs\nand by the gas station is a trailer with quadcrashers on the back. Grab one,\nthen head to the corrupted zone north of salty, then to the south, then head\neast towards the zone by Paradise Palms. With just the one zone left, head\nnorth to the area by Wailing Woods to complete this challenge.\n\nShould you happen to run into any enemies, just use the quadcrasher’s boost\nability to zip away in a flash.\n\n**Destroy Cube Fragments 0/3**\n\nIf you’re doing all the challenges in one go, this should double up with the\ndamage cube fragments challenge. As you can imagine, this is another fairly\nstraightforward affair. Head to a zone, smash the fragment and repeat two more\ntimes. That’s it.\n\n**Complete Fortnitemares Challenges 0/14**\n\nAnd to finish up everything, complete 14 of the Fortnitemares challenges. Part\n3 is full of easy challenges, as is Part 4. As for Part 1 and Part 2, you can\nignore the staged challenges that require you to complete several stages over\ndifferent matches and instead opt for anything to do with damage or kill.\nChances are, however, by the time you have to think about this challenge,\nyou’ll already have it completed.\n\nReward – New Glider\n\nOnce you’ve got all of the above completed, maybe it’s time to revisit the\nmain Battle Pass challenges?
