You can read our\nverdict below.**\n\nThe Star Wars: Battlefront 2 controversy has been spoken about more than the\nactual game itself. This, in many ways, was a shame. While it’s certainly an\narea that needed to be addressed, it did overlook what was a pretty decent\nonline shooter that took a big step up simply as it was using one of the most\nfamous licenses of all-time. It was always going to be the case, but a recent\npatch on behalf of EA and DICE aims to balance these inconsistencies. Of\ncourse, the question is whether or not it’s been successful.\n\nOn the one hand, the answer is a resounding yes. The target for many an upset\ngamer, ‘Star Cards’, have been removed from crates. This means that any loot\nbox in the game is now only good for cosmetic items or credits. Immediately\nthis is of benefit to the developer, because not only can you straight up\nignore these should you so wish, but if you choose to still indulge then\nyou’re basically buying non-impactful assets. Whether it’s of any worth is\ncompletely up to the player.\n\nIt certainly makes Battlefront 2 more fun to interact with, because opening\ncrates can be repetitive. Why anyone would want to be subjected to that upon\nbuying a game where you shoot laser guns at aliens is baffling – the quicker\nyou can get into the action, the better.\n\n**Buy Star Wars Battlefront 2 from**[ **Amazon UK**](http://amzn.to/2fKMJNK)\n**|**[ **Amazon.com**](http://amzn.to/2xcVsef)\n\nThis train of thought continues in that all heroes and ships have also been\nunlocked for everyone now. Another daft idea that originally came about\nbecause it felt like a timesink – finally, if you want to immediately use Luke\nSkywalker, you can. There’s no need to grind your way to success anymore, and\nthat really does streamline the experience and ensure you get to a point of\nenjoyment far quicker. What a concept…\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n**Related:[Call of Duty Black Ops 4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/call-\nof-duty-black-ops-4-3373836)**\n\n![Battlefront\n2](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nThe same idea has been applied to Arcade Mode as well, although DICE has gone\none step further here and opened up all ‘Star Cards’ from the off. Again, this\nhelps, because you’re not trying to jump obstacles anymore, or navigate\nthrough pretty murky waters. The setup is far more straightforward, and\nreally, what it should have been back in November 2017.\n\nThis doesn’t mean in-game purchases are gone altogether. Clearly, somewhat of\na passion project for EA (or, at the very least, an area it would like to get\nright), you can buy skins using credits or crystals – the latter of which\ncosts you actual money. They’re cosmetic only, however, so it’s no longer\npossibly to pay your way to victory – a major criticism it drew at launch.\nThat should certainly never be the answer when multiplayer is at a product’s\ncore.\n\nIn short, then, everyone involved has listened to the feedback and tried to\nintegrate that with their own desires, and it’s a fair compromise – or, at\nleast, more so than it was before. If you do indeed just want to pretend to be\nHan Solo then you now can instantly, and there’s a somewhat deeper system to\nexplore if microtransactions don’t rub you up the wrong way.\n\n**Related:[Battlefield 5 latest\nnews](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/battlefield-5-release-date-gameplay-\nnews-trailer-3231890)**\n\n![Battlefront\n2](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nThis, too, is important, because Battlefront 2 is a good shooter. Heroes Mode,\nin particular, is a riot. Knowing that it’s possible to concentrate on this\nalone is refreshing given the past few months. In terms of content, EA has\nalso released a new map in the form of Bespin. Taken from the previous title,\nit does its job as it expands the universe, even if it’s nothing to write home\nabout. The layout is decent at best, but a free map is no bad thing.\n\nDICE has also balanced the gameplay, with certain weapons toned down and a few\nannoying respawns rearranged. Characters have also received health buffs and\nother tweaks, and it all works to make Battlefront 2 a better experience. Of\nthat there’s no doubt.\n\nWhether it’s enough to bring individuals back is something else entirely. The\nsame foundations are in place, even if they’re less intrusive, and that\napproach alone – even now – still isn’t ideal. It can feel as if you’re being\nheld back from just jumping in without a care in the world.\n\n**Related:[E3 2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/e3-2018-games-news-\ntrailers-2949170)**\n\n![Battlefront\n2](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nStill, it’s pleasant to see that Battlefront 2 is in a better state than it\nwas, and will hopefully serve as an example for EA moving forward. We all make\nmistakes; it’s learning from them that counts. There’s enough proof here –\njust – to indicate that probably is the case…\n\n**Buy Star Wars Battlefront 2 from**[ **Amazon UK**](http://amzn.to/2fKMJNK)\n**|**[ **Amazon.com**](http://amzn.to/2xcVsef)\n\n## **VERDICT**\n\nStar Wars: Battlefront 2 will never be the game it was meant to be, but this\npatch takes it a little closer, if only by a few small steps. However,\nmicrotransactions are far less frustrating now, and that’s a good thing.\n\n## Score\n\n  \n\n"}
