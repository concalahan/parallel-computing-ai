That breaks the previous year’s record of 51m units shipped.\n\nThe iPhone sales brought the company profits of $18 billion (around £11.8bn)\nfrom revenue of $76.4 billion (around £50.2bn) during its most important\nquarter of the year, beating Wall Street expectations.\n\nAs the PC industry continues to struggle, Mac computers continued to buck the\ntrend, with shipments up to 5.5m from 4.8m a year ago. The company is also\ntouting record performance from the App Store.\n\nIt wasn’t all great news for Apple though as iPad sales once again slipped\nyear on year. Despite the launch of the [iPad Air\n2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/ipad-air-2-review) and new iPad mini, sales\nwere down 18 per cent to 21.4m compared to last year’s high water mark.\n\n**Read more:**[ **iPhone 6 vs iPhone 6 Plus**  \n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/iphone-6-vs-iphone-6-plus)  \n“We’d like to thank our customers for an incredible quarter, which saw demand\nfor Apple products soar to an all-time high,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “Our\nrevenue grew 30 per cent over last year to $74.6 billion, and the execution by\nour teams to achieve these results was simply phenomenal.”\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThe quarterly performance puts Apple in great shape for the forthcoming months\nwhen it will finally release the [Apple\nWatch](https://www.trustedreviews.com/apple-watch-review) and perhaps a new\n12-inch MacBook Air with a Retina Display.\n\n"}
