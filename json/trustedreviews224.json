Google Assistant, the voice-\nactivated AI that powers the smart speaker, has improved over time. In the\npast year, Google has significantly upped its intelligence and added new\nfeatures. Given that the hardware remains up to scratch, replacing the Google\nHome with a newer device wouldn’t necessarily achieve much anyway.\n\nThe bigger issue for Google is the continuing dominance of the Amazon Echo,\nwhich has had a couple of years’ headstart when it comes to smart home product\nintegration.\n\n**BUY NOW:[Google Home for £129 at\nAO.com](http://go.redirectingat.com?id=635X577574&xs=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fao.com%2Fproduct%2Fgoogle-\nhome-smart-speaker-smart-speaker-white-51779-301.aspx)**\n\n## Google Home – Coming Soon\n\nAt [Google IO 2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-\nio-2018-3382045), several improvements to the Google Assistant were announced,\ndue to launch in the coming weeks. As I get to use these new features, I’ll\nupdate the review; for now, here’s what you can expect to see.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nCustom routines look like one of the most interesting additions. These will\nlet you use a single keyword to perform multiple tasks: “OK Google, it’s movie\ntime” could dim the lights and turn up your thermostat, for example.\nCurrently, Google only supports six built-in routines, and only in the US;\nit’s unclear when routines will be launched in the UK.\n\nContinued Conversation will let the Google Home continue listening after you\nwake it, so you can continue to ask more questions. That’s a far more natural\nway to talk to the assistant. And, you’ll also be able to string commands or\nquestions into one sentence. For example, “what’s the weather in London and\nParis” or “turn on the kitchen and dining room lights”. That should make a lot\nof tasks far easier.\n\nGoogle Duplex looks really interesting, if not a little scary. Following on\nfrom the ability to make phone calls with your Google Home, Google Duplex goes\none-step further and lets the AI do the talking. Ask to make a reservation at\na local restaurant, and the Google Assistant will be able to call, understand\nthe replies and make the booking for you.\n\n**Related:[Google Home Guide](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/google-\nasssistant-guide-features-entertainment-smart-home-and-more-3462823)**\n\n## Google Home – Design\n\nGoogle Home still looks fantastic. It’s been designed as something you’ll want\nto put on show, looking less like a speaker and more like a fancy lamp or\ndiffuser.\n\nTo keep the speaker’s design as uncluttered as possible, there’s only one\nphysical button on the Google Home. It disables the microphone, if you don’t\nwant the speaker to listen in on you.\n\nThe entire top surface of the Google Home is touch-sensitive. It can be tapped\nto pause and restart musical playback, or long-pressed to activate the\nmicrophone. You can alter the volume by swiping clockwise or counter-clockwise\nin a circular motion. This feels a little laggy at times; it’s often easier to\nset the volume using your voice.\n\nOne of the key things about the design is the customisable base, which can be\ntwisted off and replaced with a unit in a different colour. It lets you match\nthe Google Home to your décor and update its look in the the future. The\nAmazon Echo has no such customisation options.\n\n**Related:[Best Bluetooth speakers](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nbluetooth-speakers)**\n\n![Google Home review\n11](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Google Home – Features\n\nConnecting to your Wi-Fi is trivial using the Google Home app, which is\navailable for iOS and Android. Once your speaker has been discovered, you can\npick the Wi-Fi network to join, connect your Google account, and give it a\nname. You’re then ready to go.\n\nOut of the box, it’s fair to say that the Google Assistant is smarter than\nAlexa. Thanks to the range of Google services in the background, the Assistant\ncan tell you the address of a local business, for example, and then follow up\nwith directions to get there. Amazon’s Alexa AI still only offers driving\ninstructions between two points that you set in the app, and often fails to\nfind addresses when asked.\n\nGoogle is more conversationally aware and more accessible to talk to. While\nAlexa often requires you to use very specific language to achieve something,\nGoogle’s approach to language is more natural. It’s context-aware, too. For\nexample, ask “What’s the weather like today?” and you get an up-to-date\nforecast. Follow up with, “And tomorrow?” and Google understands that you want\nweather information for tomorrow. Alexa simply can’t do that, and you have to\nsay the full command for everything.\n\nI prefer Google’s use of a two-word wake-up phrase (“OK Google”, or “Hey\nGoogle”), since it means that the voice assistant rarely goes off at random.\nAlexa is constantly piping up because she thinks she heard her name.\n\nThe Google Assistant uses Google Search, rather than Bing, which makes it far\nmore adept at finding information. For many questions, where Alexa just says\nit can’t help, Google Home can return information from a website via search.\n\nAlexa’s real advantage is with its expandable skills. These let the voice\nassistant effectively do anything you want as long as a third-party\nmanufacturer or service has signed up. For example, you can get Alexa to give\nyou live Tube updates via a skill, but Google Home still has no idea how the\ntrains are running.\n\nThere are also some oddities in the way that the Assistant works. For example,\nif you have a regular Gmail address, you can get your calendar and email read\nout; if you pay for G Suite address, the Assistant can’t help you. This is\nbizarre, since Alexa can work with all types of Google address.\n\nGoogle has recently added a messaging system to Home, letting you broadcast a\nmessage to all of the speakers in your home. It works well and can be handy\nfor getting the kids’ attention, but it isn’t as good as Alexa’s voice and\nvideo calling.\n\nGoogle has now launched voice calling in the UK (it was already available in\nthe US), giving you free calls from your smart speaker to UK mobile and\nlandline numbers. The Google Assistant can dial out with your mobile phone\nnumber as the caller ID, provided you manually set this within the Home app on\nyour phone. Smartly, the Google Assistant can pull in your contacts from your\nGoogle account, letting you dial anyone as though you were using your phone.\nAnd, if you perform a local business search, you can call these numbers\neasily, too.\n\nCalls are made over the internet using Google’s telephony service. Call\nquality is excellent and as good as making a call using a strong mobile\nsignal. This feature is particularly handy when you’ve left your phone\nsomewhere and want to make a call. It’s also useful if you don’t get a lot of\nminutes with your mobile plan. Please note that incoming calls are not\nbroadcast to your Google Home devices, as this feature would be a lot harder\nto implement.\n\nMultiple users are supported, with Google matching the voice to the account.\nThis lets it return different information based on the person asking, such as\npersonal calendar appointments, and individual contacts for hands-free voice\ncalling.\n\nElsewhere, the Assistant and Alexa offerings are quite similar. You can get\nweather reports, news updates, sports scores and stock price updates to start\nyour day. There’s plenty of information on local businesses, plus the ability\nto add stuff to lists, set timers, convert measurements and answer pretty much\nany question that pops into your head. There isn’t much in it, but Google Home\ndoes it with a little more personality than Alexa.\n\n## Google Home – Smart home\n\nOne of the main reasons to buy a smart assistant is so that you can voice-\ncontrol your smart devices. Google Home supports products from the major\nmanufacturers, including [Nest\nthermostats](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nest-thermostat), [Samsung\nSmartThings](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-smartthings) and\n[Philips Hue](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/philips-hue) lights. But\nthe range of supported devices pales in comparison to those available on the\nEcho. My advice is to check before you buy to see which smart speaker supports\nthe devices you want to control.\n\nSupported devices are, for the most part, easy enough to control. Changing my\nHue lights, both in brightness and colour, is just as easy with the Home as it\nis with the Echo.\n\nThere are areas of difference, some of which are quite frustrating. For\nexample, with my Amazon Echo I can set my Nest to Eco mode, and then bring it\nup to heat by changing back to Heat mode. With the Google Home, I can’t set\nEco mode, but if the thermostat is already in energy saving, I can change it\nback to Heat mode.\n\nGoogle has recently added announcements into Google Home, which lets the\nspeaker notify you in real-time of certain events. The first device that I’ve\nseen to use this is the [Nest\nHello](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nest-hello). With announcements\nturned on, a press on the doorbell will let you know through your smart\nspeakers that someone’s at the door. Individual speakers can be opted out of\nannouncements.\n\nWhile this feature is handy, it’s a shame that you can’t currently answer the\nnotifications, say answering your doorbell through your smart speaker. This\nmeans that you still have to reach for your phone, which isn’t as convenient.\n\n## Google Home – Sound quality\n\nWhen comparing audio playback on Home and Echo, both have their pros and cons.\nGoogle Home offers meatier bass and a more rounded sound, but the new Echo\ngoes much louder. Google Home’s 100% volume wasn’t as loud as I’d expected it\nto be, and once you get to about 70% it starts to feel a little distorted.\n\nIt doesn’t come close to the sound quality of a dedicated Bluetooth speaker,\nsuch as the [UE Boom 2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/ue-boom-2), but\nthen you wouldn’t expect it to be at its much lower price. The Google Home\nisn’t a gadget you’d want as the primary speaker at a house party, but for\ngeneral, everyday use it’s fine. Most importantly, the audio is detailed\nenough to hear voice responses clearly and is perfect for radio or audio\nbooks.\n\nPairing with services such as Spotify, Google Play Music, YouTube and TuneIn\nwas easily accomplished within the Home app, which also enables you to choose\na preferred provider. There’s a quirky range of voice commands for accessing\nnews, playlists and podcasts from all of those services, too.\n\nAt launch, the Google Home didn’t have Bluetooth support, but this has since\nbeen added. Using it couldn’t be easier: just ask Google to turn on Bluetooth\nand you can pair your phone to it. That turns the Google Home into a useful\nBluetooth speaker and means that you can play from music sources not directly\nsupported, such as Apple Music.\n\nAudio quality doesn’t improve using Bluetooth, but at least there’s now the\nflexibility to use different music sources. For the best audio quality, it\nwould make sense to buy one of our [best Bluetooth\nspeakers](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/bluetooth-speakers-3431819).\n\n![Google Home review\n7](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nCast support means that you can send audio directly to a compatible speaker or\n[Chromecast Audio](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/chromecast-audio).\nPlus, you can control playback directly using your voice. Intelligently, when\nGoogle Home picks up a voice request, it dips the volume on any devices it’s\ncasting to so that you don’t have to shout.\n\nYou can create groups of devices, casting to multiple speakers at once, which\nis a neat trick for house parties. However, casting isn’t as flexible as using\na Sonos system, particularly if you’re using Spotify. With Spotify and Cast,\nyou can only play one track; with Sonos, you can play different tracks on\ndifferent speakers using the single account.\n\n![Google Home review\n3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nGoogle Home can also voice control video and image casting to a Chromecast,\nletting you send Netflix shows or your photos to a compatible TV. It’s a handy\ntrick, and often more convenient. When the doorbell rings, asking Google Home\nto pause the action is often far quicker than scrabbling around for a phone\nand then finding the playback controls.\n\n![Google Home review\n5](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\n## Why buy a Google Home?\n\nGoogle Home remains a great product and, in many ways, the Google Assistant is\neasier to talk to and gives better results than Amazon Alexa. Whether it’s the\nright product for you comes down to what you want to achieve.\n\n**Related:[Google Home vs Amazon\nAlexa](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-home-vs-amazon-\necho-2945424)**\n\nIf you want a powerful voice assistant with control for Chromecast and a few\nsmart home products, Google Home certainly does the job.\n\nThat said, the Echo range is larger and includes devices with screens, too; it\nalso supports more smart home kit. In addition, the new [Echo 2nd\nGeneration](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/amazon-echo) is now cheaper\nthan the Home. To my mind, that makes Amazon’s smart assistant a better\ninvestment today, with a wider range of products to choose from if you want to\ndevices in every room in your home.\n\n## Verdict\n\nThe Amazon Echo and Alexa maintain their crown for now, but the Google Home\nand Assistant still make a powerful combination.\n\n## Score\n\n  \n\n"}
