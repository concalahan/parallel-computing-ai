And our ‘one to avoid’ is an\nApple knock-off that’ll have Cupertino’s lawyers rubbing their hands with\nglee.\n\n**Related:[The Ticwatch 2 is a smartwatch like no other – featured\nKickstarter](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/why-you-should-crowdfund-the-\nticwatch-2-the-smartwatch-you-can-tickle)**\n\n## What is The Wolfe?\n\nIt’s a box containing more processing power than you can shake a mouse at.\nPlug it into your laptop, and you can play high-end games, experience virtual\nreality, and do any high-speed rendering as if you were playing with the power\nof a pricey desktop PC.\n\n![the wolfe\nwork](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nTechnically, it’s what’s known as a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit). This is\nthe part that focusses on gaming and 3D rendering, as opposed to the CPU\n(Central Processing Unit), which is more the “brains” of your computer.\n\nIt comes in two versions. The Wolfe uses an [Nvidia GTX\n950](https://www.trustedreviews.com/nvidia-geforce-gtx-950-review) GPU – that\nhas 768 cores working at 1,024MHz, giving it a computing power of 1.57\nTeraFlops. And The Wolfe Pro runs on an [Nvidia GTX\n970](https://www.trustedreviews.com/nvidia-geforce-gtx-970-review), giving you\n1,664 cores operating at 1,050MHz, resulting in a whopping 3.49 TeraFlops.\nThat’s as much power as a top-end [Mac\nPro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/apple-mac-pro-review), and that’s on top\nof your laptop’s existing GPU. Beefy.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThe Wolfe works with both Windows and macOS, so you should be able to use it\nwhether you’re a laptop or MacBook owner.\n\n## Why is it interesting?\n\nIt basically turns your laptop into two computers. When you need the extra\ngrunt, plug it in and it’ll give you the power of a desktop. But, if you nip\nout and only need to work on a document, just leave it at home, taking only\nyour feather-light laptop with you.\n\n![the wolfe\nbag](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nHey presto! Your laptop has desktop power when you need it, and is a light and\nportable computer when you don’t.\n\nOf course you can take it with you if you like. It’s a little smaller than a\nshoebox, and weighs 908g, which is less than a MacBook Air. So it should fit\nin your bag without too much trouble.\n\nIt also makes virtual reality a lot more accessible. Until now, VR has only\nbeen possible on a [pricey desktop\ncomputer](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/can-i-run-the-htc-vive), but\nplug The Wolfe into your laptop, and it has the grunt necessary to render\nvirtual worlds. Sling a headset in your bag, and you’ve got VR experiences on\nthe go.\n\n![EZ Gif](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \n**Related:[We’ve backed the Superbook on Kickstarter – here’s why you should\ntoo](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/turn-your-phone-into-a-laptop-\nwith-the-superbook-our-kickstarter-pick-of-the-week)**\n\nIt’ll also be a boon to anyone demoing their VR software. Instead of making\npeople come to them, or making sure they have a sufficiently powerful PC, they\ncan take VR to any office.\n\nWith VR headsets still prohibitively expensive, this could be the shot in the\narm that virtual reality needs to go mainstream.\n\nThe Wolfe can also help your laptop play the latest games, without requiring\nyou to replace it with a pricey and bulky gaming-specific model\n\n. And it lets creative professionals using graphics programs work faster and\nmore efficiently than ever.\n\n## What are the challenges?\n\nAs ever with crowdfunding sites, you support a project at your own risk.\nThere’s no guarantee a project will succeed, or even get off the ground. So\nbear that in mind before you cough up your dosh.\n\n![the wolfe\nvr](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nManufacturing any product is tricky, but Wolfepack has sought to minimise the\nrisk by partnering with Dragon Innovation – the firm that helped bring the\n[Pebble](https://www.trustedreviews.com/pebble-time-round-review) smartwatch\nand [Makerbot](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/makerbot-releases-android-\napp-for-controlling-3d-printers) 3D printer to market. Dragon has helped asses\nproduction costs and economies of scale, so – fingers crossed – it should all\ngo smoothly.\n\n**Related:[Why you should fund a System Shock\nremaster](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/system-shock-this-week-s-\nfeatured-kickstarter-crowdfunding-project)**\n\nHowever, Wolfepack does note that high demand could cause delays. Seeing as\nthe project has smashed its funding goal many times over, it could be a victim\nof its own success.\n\n## Is there anything similar available?\n\nVery similar to The Wolfe is the Razer Core. Allowing you to use full-length,\ndouble-wide PCIe desktop graphics cards, Razer’s external graphics enclosure\nattaches to your laptop via Thunerbolt 3 (USB Type-C).\n\n![Razer\nCore](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nYou have to buy the graphics card separately from the enclosure itself, but it\ncomes with additional I/O ports such as 4 USB 3.0 connections and Ethernet.\nPlus, it features a little handle, which makes it a bit easier to carry\naround.\n\nIt’ll only work with Thunderbolt 3 ports however, so it makes Mac\ncompatibility a bit tricky, though the expected MacBook Pro update could\nintroduce the connection. The Wolfe is available in Thunderbolt 2 and 3\nflavours, though future versions will only use Thunderbolt 3.\n\n## Should I crowdfund this?\n\nIf you like the idea of VR on the go, better gaming on your laptop and more\npower to play with, then yes.\n\n**Read more:[Worst crowdfunding\ncampaigns](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/worst-crowdfunding-\ncampaigns-kickstarter-indiegogo)**\n\n![the wolfe in\nsitu](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe $399 (£302) early birds are sold out, but you can pick one up for $449\n(£340), or $599 (£453) for the Wolfe Pro. That’s a hell of a lot cheaper than\nsome of the top-end gaming laptops and PCs you’ll need to invest in if you\nwant to run the [Oculus Rift](https://www.trustedreviews.com/oculus-rift-\nreview) or [HTC Vive](https://www.trustedreviews.com/htc-vive-review).\n\nShipping will start in March (or February for anyone lucky enough to have\nnabbed an early bird).\n\n## And one to avoid this week…\n\n[Pear Inc. Start-up Company](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/pear-inc-\nstartup-company#/). Does that logo look familiar? We thought so. Pear’s motto\nis: “The only thing that is permanent if [sic] change. Our focus is to create\ntools for the mind that advance human kind.” Such as? It doesn’t say. And what\nhas it done in the past? Again, there’s no mention.\n\nWe assume it’s a joke. But even so, it looks like a lawsuit waiting to happen.  \n **  \nWatch The Refresh: The best tech gossip and reviews every week  \n**\n\n****\n\nWill you be investing in the Wolfe?
