Our guide explains how to check your password strength\nand protect yourself against the latest hacks.**\n\nScarcely a day goes by without some kind of online security brouhaha hitting\nthe headlines. Our digital selves are more vulnerable than ever in 2017, yet\nwe’re often our own worst enemy – especially when it comes to the strength of\nour passwords.\n\nOne [study](https://blog.keepersecurity.com/2017/01/13/most-common-passwords-\nof-2016-research-study/), by password manager Keeper, shows that many of us\nare still using rudimentary phrases to safeguard our accounts, with nearly 17%\nof people still relying on the infamous ‘123456’ – equivalent to wearing Swiss\ncheese as a condom.\n\nA handful of seemingly more complex combos appear on the list, but Keeper\nnotes that these too are vulnerable, as they’re based on predictable keystroke\npatterns.\n\nWithout further ado, let’s take a look at the easiest way to check your\npassword strength and see if you’ve been hacked, as a rather useful new tool\nhas just entered the wild.\n\n**Related:[Best password manager](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-\npassword-manager_round-up)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n###  Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\n## Password Hacking: How to check if your password is safe\n\nDevising a secure password isn’t as easy as it sounds, but fortunately, there\nare a number of decent password strength checking tools available for free\nonline.\n\nTwo that standout in particular are Kaspersky Lab’s [Secure Password\nChecker](http://password.social-kaspersky.com/en), and [How Secure Is My\nPassword?](https://howsecureismypassword.net/) (HSIMP), which is backed by\npopular password manager Dashlane.\n\nWhile neither checker is bulletproof – both sites state that they are purely\nfor educational purposes – they do give you a rough idea of how tough your\npassword is to hack.\n\nOf the two, Secure Password Checker is definitely the more paranoid. I entered\nthe same phrase into both tools, with Kaspersky’s informing me that a brute-\nforce attack on my computer would crack my password in just 15 seconds – HSIMP\nhad the figure at four days.\n\nThe discrepancy underlines that password strength checkers aren’t 100%\nreliable, but they are a starting point if you’re looking to get serious about\nyour online security.\n\n**Related:[How to secure your home network from\nhackers](https://www.trustedreviews.com/how-tos/how-to-secure-your-home-\nnetwork-from-hackers)**\n\n_**What happens if driverless cars kill?

This means you can not\nonly check if one of your email accounts has been breached, but examine the\nhealth of your favourite passwords. You can find this particular tool\n[here.](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords)\n\nOther options to check if you’ve been hacked include [Breach\nAlarm](https://breachalarm.com/) and [Has my email been\nhacked?](https://hacked-emails.com/), although they’re not quite as\ncomprehensive or up-to-date, based on my investigations; inputting an email I\nknew had been compromised, all three sites flagged the 2013 Adobe hack, but\nonly HIBP highlighted a smaller 2016 breach of another website.\n\nFor more tips on how to improve your online security, check out [Get Safe\nOnline](https://www.getsafeonline.org/), a UK site that’s sort of like the\nCitizen’s Advice Bureau for digital denizens.\n\n**Related:[Best free antivirus software](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-\nfree-antivirus_round-up_Page-1)**\n\nThose are the best available options right now, but keep this page bookmarked\nand check back regularly, as we’ll continue to update it with all the latest\nsafeguards we discover.  \n**  \n**\n\n"}
