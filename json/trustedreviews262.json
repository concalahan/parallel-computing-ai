According to Planet Computers’representatives, this means the Gemini will combine the portability of asmartphone with the functionality of a 2-in-1 or keyboard-cased tablet.It certainly looks the part in the flesh, though we’ll obviously have to waitto spend some more living day-to-day with one before passing a properjudgement. This should be arriving in the very near future, so watch thisspace.**What’s your MWC 2018 highlight? Let us know in the comments below.** **  **"}
