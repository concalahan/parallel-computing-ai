G4?\n\n_**Update:** It might be ‘old’ now, but the G4 is still a great phone –\nespecially as it’s currently going for under £300/$250 at select retailers.\nThere still isn’t much else in that price bracket to worry it at the moment._\n\nThe LG G4 has a lot to live up to since its predecessor, the [LG\nG3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/lg-g3-review), was crowned\n_TrustedReviews’_ Phone of the Year in 2014. It largely succeeds, too. The LG\nG4 has taken all the best bits from the LG G3 and rolled them into a new and\nimproved package.The LG G4 is to the LG G3 what the [iPhone\n5S](https://www.trustedreviews.com/iphone-5s-review) is to the [iPhone\n5](https://www.trustedreviews.com/apple-iphone-5-review). That’s to say, its\nalterations are more evolutionary than revolutionary.\n\nDon’t let that deceive you, though – it’s brought with it changes that hit\nnearly all the right notes. This is another all-round excellent flagship from\nLG and it costs considerably less than the likes of the [Samsung Galaxy\nS6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-s6-review) or [iPhone\n6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/iphone-6-review), while matching, or\nsurpassing, those competitors in nearly every respect. It provides speedy\nperformance, a great screen and arguably the best smartphone camera around.\n\nIf you don’t mind the hard plastic that LG seems intent on persisting with,\nthen this could well be the handset for you. Down from £450/ $550 at launch to\nas little as £250/$200, the LG G4 is now even better value for money and still\npresents a compelling case.\n\n**Watch: LG G4 video review**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n## LG G4 – Design\n\n_148.9 x 76.1 x 9.8 mm, 155g, Plastic edge, Removable back, Rear button_\n\n**This phone has been replaced: Read our[LG\nG5](https://www.trustedreviews.com/lg-g5-review) __ and [LG\nG6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/lg-g6-review) reviews** _  \n_  \nThe LG G4 looks and feels a lot like the G3 and in most ways this is a good\nthing. In most ways.\n\nA 5.5-inch screen can make a phone unwieldy – just try handling the mammoth\n[iPhone 6 Plus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/iphone-6-plus-review) or\n[Galaxy Note 4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-note-4-review),\nor worst of all the [Nexus 6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/nexus-6-review).\nNot so the LG G4. This is a phablet screen in a smartphone’s body. That means\nthat you can use the G4 one-handed as easily as you’d use a 5-inch phone.\n\n**Related:[LG G4 tips and\ntricks](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/lg-g4-tips-and-tricks)**\n\n![LG G4 9](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \nUsing the LG G4 is even easier than handling a smaller handset, in some\nrespects. The rear button design that’s been around since the [LG\nG2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/lg-g2-review) has had a little fine tuning\nand works better than ever. In fact it’s so clever that we’re shocked other\ncompanies haven’t copied it yet. It gives you easy access to all the buttons\nyou need with your index finger, by touch alone. This means both left- and\nright-handed people will have the same experience.\n\nIt takes a bit of getting used to if you haven’t used a phone like it before,\nbut within a few days you’ll be handling the LG G4 like a pro, and loving\nthose rear buttons.\n\n**Related:[Best cheap smartphones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-cheap-\nmobile-phones_round-up)**\n\n![LG G4](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \nThe only problem with their location is taking photos using a button, rather\nthan tapping the screen. You can do this on the G4 using the volume-down\nbutton, but it requires you to awkwardly stretch a finger behind the phone.\n\nIn spite of this one small issue, ease of use is the major benefit of the rear\nbuttons, but clean design is another. All the edges of the G4 are smooth, save\nthe bottom which is home to the Micro USB port and headphone jack. Nothing\ninterferes with holding the phone comfortably.\n\n****  \n\nThe key difference between the LG G4 and the G3 is a faint curve to the\nscreen. And when I say faint, I mean faint. This is nothing like the steeply\ncurved sides on the [Samsung Galaxy S6\nEdge](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-s6-edge-review) and\ndoesn’t give the phone anywhere near the sex appeal of Samsung’s far more\nexpensive curio.  \n**  \nRelated:[Best Android phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-android-\nphones-1_round-up)**\n\n![LG G4\n17](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \nThe curve makes the phone ever so slightly banana shaped, so the mouth-piece\nrests nearer your yapper when you’re on a call. Unlike the bendy [LG G Flex\n2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/lg-g-flex-2-review) or famously curved Nokia\n8110 (of Matrix fame), the curve here is so faint that it makes hardly any\ndifference at all. OK, it does fit a little better than straight phones do\nwhen pocketed in tight jeans, and it does feel nice in your hand, but that’s\nabout it.\n\nLG claims the curve makes the phone “20% tougher” – 20% tougher than what,\nwe’re not sure, although the little bit of flex it has could, potentially,\nspread the force of an impact better than more rigid handsets. Like the Galaxy\nS6 Edge all signs point to a classic case of something that’s been done\nbecause it can be done, not because it offers any benefits you’ll really care\nabout.\n\n![LG G4\n19](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \nIt’s not just the curve we’re dubious about. The edge of the G4 is glossy\nplastic made to look, a little, like metal. We’d hoped this was a trait\nconsigned to the smartphone graveyard along with the chromed-plastic edge on\nthe Galaxy S5. The LG G4’s is nowhere near as bad as that, but it’s not a\nmaterial that stands up to the likes of the metal iPhone 6, HTC One M9 or\nGalaxy S6 in terms of cachet.\n\nStill the LG G4 is a phone that is put together well. It has good heft without\nbeing too heavy, and it doesn’t creak when put under stress. Splash out a\nlittle more and you can get a rear made from a thin layer of genuine leather,\nas opposed to the plastic back (although if you opt for leather you also get a\nplastic back bundled in the box).  \n**  \nRelated:[LG G4 vs iPhone 6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/lg-g4-vs-\niphone-6)**\n\n![LG G4](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \nIf you’ve not squeamish about leather, this is the version to go for. The seam\nhelps guide you to the rear buttons, and is super-grippy. It makes the LG G4\nlook more classy, and closer in value to its illustrious competitors. It\ndoesn’t feel great, though. There’s no warmth or softness to the the leather,\nso it doesn’t give you the feel of slipping on your favourite, worn leather\njacket.\n\nIt may not look as pricey as a metal phone, but when it comes to spot-on\nergonomics and fitting a big screen into a small body, the LG G4 is as good as\nit gets.\n\n[ Next  \nScreen and speakers ](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/lg-g4-screen-and-\nspeakers-page-2)\n\n"}
