News and Features\nEditor James Laird reads between the lines and explains why the world’s first\n5G mobile phone is nearly here.**\n\nIn a press\n[statement](https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2018/01/31/qualcomm-and-\nsamsung-announce-expanded-strategic-relationship), Qualcomm described the deal\nas a “multi-year strategic relationship agreement between the two companies in\nvarious technology areas and across a range of mobile devices,” which roughly\ntranslates into muggle as ‘first dibs on each other’s latest mobile tech’.\n\nQualcomm goes on to say that the arrangement is intended to secure the two\nfirms’ relationship through the “transition to 5G,” which strongly suggests\nthe first consumer 5G phone will be a Samsung one – and we think we can narrow\nit down even further.\n\nSamsung has previously said it could launch its first 5G effort as soon as\n2019, and if this proves to be the case, it would be surprising if it wasn’t\none of the firm’s flagship efforts, meaning the Galaxy S10 or Note 10.\n\nThe Galaxy S10 could be a good bet, as it’s expected to be a major update for\nthe series, as opposed to this year’s more incremental (but still exciting)\n[Galaxy S9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s9-release-\ndate-specs-features-price-uk-3266552) refresh, which is set to be revealed at\n[MWC 2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/mwc-2018-news-rumours-dates-\npreview-barcelona-3372243). Plus, the Galaxy S10 will – as with the [iPhone\nX](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-x) – be a ‘milestone phone’\nfor Samsung, with the first Samsung Galaxy phone having been released in 2009.\n\nHowever, the Note 10 seems equally likely, as its typical autumn release\nwindow leaves more time for 5G development to be finalised, and the inclusion\nof even faster mobile data capabilities would align more neatly with the Note\nrange’s ‘pro’ slant.\n\nCombine all this with the fact that EE has completed successful network trials\nin the UK and Qualcomm’s new X50 modem has powered a 5G ‘reference phone’ in\nlab tests, and it really does look like 5G is nearly here.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nWhat about the mythical [Galaxy\nX](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-x) foldable phone, you ask,\nwhich also ties in nicely with the 10th anniversary of the Galaxy phone range?\nWhile 2019 seems like a good bet for the Galaxy X launch (what with ‘X’ being\n10 and it being the line’s 10th anniversary…), Samsung scrapping its existing\npremium phone and phablet one-two punch seems out of the question.\n\nRather, it’ll likely do as Apple did and release the foldable Galaxy X as a\nspecial ‘wow’ phone, whilst maintaining the numbered Galaxy S and Note update\npattern.\n\n**Related:[What is 5G?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/what-is-5g-a-\nrough-guide-to-the-next-generation-of-mobile-networks-2911748)**\n\n## Is Samsung now the mother of Snapdragons?\n\n![snapdragon](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe other big implication of the Samsung/Qualcomm tie-up is that Sammy’s\nGalaxy S phones look set to get exclusive first access to Qualcomm’s latest\nSnapdragon SoCs.\n\nThis was the case in 2017 with the [Snapdragon\n835](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/snapdragon-835-phones-processor-\nspecs-speed-benchmark-chipset-cores-2944086), and is expected to be the case\nagain this year with the [Snapdragon\n845](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/snapdragon-845-release-date-phones-\nspecs-features-benchmarks-news-rumours-2948107), which is why a number of\nother leading Android manufacturers – namely Huawei and LG – aren’t thought to\nbe launching their new flagships at Mobile World Congress. With the\nannouncement of a ‘strategic relationship’ around mobile technology, this\nseems unlikely to change.\n\nWhich is good news for Samsung, and bad news for everyone else.\n\nMore intriguingly, this new paradigm could have a big impact on the mobile\nprocessor space. While Qualcomm’s Snapdragon chips are the household name –\n“My phone has the new MediaTek chip,” bragged nobody ever – playing second\nfiddle to Samsung isn’t exactly a sustainable business model.\n\nCould Huawei-owned HiSilicon (maker of the Kirin line of SoCs) or the\naforementioned MediaTek quietly benefit from the deal? And what does it mean\nfor Samsung’s own Exynos line of chips, which feature in the Galaxy devices we\ntypically get in the UK?\n\nWhile the world’s first 5G phone may well have been cleared for take-off,\nSamsung and Qualcomm’s seemingly mundane ‘strategic partnership’ leaves us\nwith just as many questions as it does answers.\n\n**Related:[Best phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-phone)**\n\n_**Do you agree or disagree with James’ crystal ball gazing?
