Here’s what\nyou need to know.**\n\n## Microsoft Event Overview\n\nMicrosoft has certainly busy, dropping a bunch of new software and hardware\nannouncements on us during today’s two-hour keynote. First off, we learned\nthat the **Windows 10 Creators Update** will be arriving for free next Spring,\nbringing with it 3D design software and new gaming-related features.\n\nAlso on the agenda was the **Surface Book i7** , a refreshed version of the\nold Surface Book laptop hybrid. The new model features an improved processor,\na 30% boost to battery life, and an R.R.P of $2,399 – coming November.\n\nBut the big announcement was the **Surface Studio** , an all-in-one designed\nto put the hurt to Apple’s iMac. It comes with a dedicated GPU, a 28-inch\ndisplay (with a 192ppi pixel density), and a base price tag of $2,999.\n\nRead on for all the finer details.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/statuses/791313894321029120\n\n## Windows 10 Creators Update\n\nMicrosoft confirmed that a new Windows 10 update would be rolled out in\n**early 2017** , and it would be called the Windows 10 Creators Update. The\nreally good news is that it will be **available for free** on every Windows 10\ndevice. And starting this week, early builds of the Creators Update will be\nissued to all Windows Insiders – that’s Microsoft’s beta-testing program,\nwhich you can sign up to for free.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n“You’re going to find unparalleled new ways to create and play,” said Terry\nMyerson, Microsoft’s VP of Windows and Devices. “You’re going to find new\nexperiences that place your most important people at the centre of your\ndigital life.”\n\n**3D design software:** The first big change that’s being shipped with the\nWindows 10 Creators Update is a new focus on 3D – the slogan of the hour is\n‘3D is for everyone’, apparently. It was all a little vague initially, but it\nseems like there’s going to be new 3D design software built into Windows 10\ndevices. The idea is that amateurs will be able to easily create 3D designs, a\ntask that has previously has significant barriers to entry. This could be\ngreat for new-age technologies like 3D-printing or designing content for the\nMicrosoft Hololens augmented reality headset.\n\n“We create to evolve as a species, to express our biggest ideas,” said Megan\nSaunders, who works on Experiences at Microsoft. “We believe if we can empower\nthe world with 3D, we can unlock a new era of creativity that can enhance your\nideas and storytelling.”\n\nShe continued: “80% of people aged 12-24 believe the creativity is one of the\nmost important things. In fact, they value it 14 points higher than previous\ngenerations.”\n\nSaunders used her a Windows 10 app – part of the Windows Capture 3D Experience\n– on her HP Elite x3 smartphone to photograph a sand castle, turning it\nimmediately into a 3D render on the handset. She then announced **Paint 3D** ,\nan evolution of Microsoft’s MS Paint software. Saunders was able to add the 3D\nsand castle into a beach scene Paint 3D, as well as a 3D render of herself and\nher daughter, all in a virtual 3D space. Saunders was also able to create 3D\ndesigns manually using the ‘Doodle’ tool, which involved drawing a shape (in\nthis case, a cloud) using a Surface Pen.\n\n![paint\n3d](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe Paint 3D software will also support Minecraft, with Saunders explaining:\n“With the Creators Update, not only will you be able to export your creations\ndirectly from the game, but you’ll also be able to 3D print them from right\nhere in the community.”\n\nBut it’s not just Paint and Minecraft getting some 3D love. Saunders confirmed\nthat 3D would be integrated across the “most popular Microsoft applications”\nover the next year, including Microsoft PowerPoint, where you’ll be able to\nimport interactive, animated 3D designs into presentations.\n\nExcitingly, Microsoft is also **building its Microsoft Edge browser into the\nHololens augmented reality headset**. You’ll be able to pull out 3D objects\nfrom the browser – like Saunder’s omnipresent sand castle – and edit it in a\n3D holographic space.\n\n![virtual\nmicrosoft](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nTo empower all of this 3D goodness, Microsoft is releasing a number of\n“virtual reality accessories” that will let users create and enjoy VR.\nManufacturers like Dell, HP, Lenovo, Asus, and Acer will be creating headsets\nwith “inside-out, six-degrees of freedom sensors”. Myerson said: “This means\nthere’ll be zero need for a separete room, zero need for a complicated setup.”\nThe starting price for these Creators Update accessories will be $299 – UK\npricing remains a mystery for now.  \n **  \nGaming on Windows 10:** Microsoft also confirmed that the Windows 10 Creators\nUpdate would have a big focus on gaming – and particularly game broadcasting\nand eSports.\n\n“This year alone, Minecraft videos have been watched over 50 billion times,”\nsaid Myerson. “Game viewing is now a real social phenomenon, and this type of\npassion and innovation is inspiring us.”\n\nHe added: “Windows 10 will be your platform for gaming glory.”\n\nPart of this involves building Beam – that’s an existing game broadcasting\nsoftware – into Windows. When you’re playing, you’ll be able to start\nbroadcasting with a single button press. Making the announcement, Jenn McCoy,\nfrom the Xbox team at Microsoft, said: “The popularity and time spent watching\ngaming is through the roof.” According to McCoy, viewers will be able to tune\nin from their Xbox, PC, or smartphone, and friends can be notified when you\nstart streaming.\n\nWith the Creators Update, **you’ll also be able to create custom gaming\ntournaments** using ‘Arena on Xbox Live’. You can select different games,\nrules, and scheduling, while dull admin work like stats and scoring is handled\nby the ‘Arena’ feature.\n\n“We want to give gamers the ability to create their own tournaments or\nchallenges,” said McCoy. “You don’t have to qualify for a professional\ntournament, and you don’t have to track scores offline. ‘Arena for Xbox Live’\nwill do it all for you.”\n\nThe final gaming announcement was that bitstream audio passthrough, including\nDolby Atmos support, is coming with the Creators Update for the Xbox One S\nBlu-ray player.  \n **  \nSocial networks:** Microsoft also reckons that social networks are way too\ncomplex right now, and wants to make it much easier to get in touch with your\nfriends – as in your actual friends, rather than your 400+ ‘Facebook friends’.\n\n“When we talk to our customers, we see a universal truth again and again: that\nmost of our communications happen with a few key people,” said Allison\nO’Mahoney, who works on Windows at Microsoft.\n\nThe new ‘Windows Sharing Experience’ will understand a new concept called ‘My\nPeople’, where you’ll be able to quickly share content. Whenever you share\nmedia using the Microsoft Creators Update through Windows 10, you’ll see your\nfavourite people first.\n\nThere’s also a new messaging system that will provide new ‘people icons’ that\nwill let you quickly contact people on various platforms, like Skype or Mail.\nEach person icon will have all of an individual’s relevant Microsoft services\nincluded, so you’ll be able to ping people on the appropriate platform for any\ngiven occasion. The icons will also support emoji notifications; in reality,\nthat means smiley faces and unicorns popping up above your task bar – that\nwon’t be annoying at all, right?\n\n![emoji](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Surface Book i7\n\nIn a surprise move, Microsoft also announced a refresh of the old Surface Book\nlaptop hybrid. In a bid to improve performance, the Surface Book now features\nmore powerful Intel Core i7 processors. There’s also a redesigned heating\nsystem and a claimed 30% boost to battery life – that’s 16 hours per charge.\n\n“Gamers, they want more frame rate. They just want it. I don’t really get it,\nbut they want it,” said Panos Panay, who heads up Microsoft’s Surface\ndivision, who revealed that graphics performance had been doubled. According\nto Panay, the graphics on the new Surface Book i7 are three times as good as\nthose on the highest-spec 13-inch MacBook Pro.\n\n![surface book\ni7](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nOther than those changes, the Surface Book i7 is practically identical to its\npredecessor. It’s available to pre-order from today for $2,399, and will go on\nsale in November.\n\n## Surface Studio\n\nAs expected, Microsoft unveiled an all-in-one PC called the Surface Studio.\nIt’s a blatant attempt to take on the Apple iMac, and it looks relatively\nimpressive. It’s available for **pre-order starting today** , and will set you\nback a staggering **$2,999** , rising to **$4,199** for the top spec model. If\nyou want to try before you buy, you’ll be able to try it out at any Microsoft\nStore from tomorrow. But if you’re sure you want one, act quickly: Panay says\nthe Surface Studio will be “available in limited quantities this holiday”.\n\n“I believe in this thing, where your ideas can be one of your most valuable\nassets – each one of you,” said Panay, speaking about the new all-in-one. “I\nalso believe that this product will help you bring your ideas to life.”\n\nhttps://twitter.com/statuses/791311402162069505\n\nThe Surface Studio features a touchscreen 28-inch IPS display with a 3:2\naspect ratio and a respectable 192ppi pixel density. My rudimentary napkin-\nmath tells me that’s probably **4,500 x 3,000 pixels**. By comparison, Apple’s\n5K iMac has a higher 5,120 x 2,880 pixel resolution with a 217ppi pixel\ndensity.\n\nBut what’s really exciting is that it’s just 12.5mm thick; Microsoft reckons\nit’s the “thinnest LCD monitor ever built” – and it certainly looks less\nchunky than an iMac. That said, the design is generally very similar to the\niMac; I can completely imagine average customers mistakenly thinking the\nSurface Studio is an Apple device.\n\nAs far as specs go, you’re getting an unspecified quad-core Intel Core i7 CPU,\n32GB of DDR4 RAM, a 2TB hybrid drive, and stereo Dolby 2.1 speakers. Oh, and a\ndedicated graphics card in the form of **Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 980M GPU** –\nthat’s Microsoft’s top-end mobile GPU. We’re not sure why Microsoft didn’t opt\nfor a desktop GPU, but Panay seems convinced that the Surface Studio is plenty\npowerful: “It has been phenomenal to use – no question. But performance is\nmore than specs.”\n\n![surface\nstudio](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAlso useful is a built-in microphone array that will let you summon Cortana,\nMicrosoft’s virtual assistant, from across the room. You’ll be able to task\nher with setting reminders, searching for information, and all the other usual\nAI errands. And on the front, there’s a HD camera on the front, which will\nwork with Windows Hello, Microsoft’s facial recognition unlocking system.\n\nThere’s also a unique hinge system that will let you lay the Surface Studio\nflat (like a tablet), or at various angles.\n\n![surface\nstudio](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Surface Dial\n\nMicrosoft also unveiled a new controller called Surface Dial, which is\ndesigned to work with the Surface Studio.\n\nIt’s a twistable knob that brings additional functionality to Windows, and is\nbuilt right into the software’s global controls. For instance, if you’re\nwriting or drawing, you can twist the Dial backwards to gradually undo your\nwork.\n\n![surface\ndial](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Related:[Xbox One S vs Xbox\nOne](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/xbox-one-s-vs-xbox-one)**\n\n**Watch: Surface Studio: First Look**\n\n**What do you think of today’s Microsoft announcements?
