Although we didn’t get\na release date, gameplay trailer or even story information, Nintendo did\nconfirm the game was in development exclusively for [Nintendo Switch.\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/nintendo-switch-review)**\n\n_Trusted Reviews_ has rounded up all the latest news about the sequel. We’ll\nbe updating this page as new information crops up so be sure to bookmark it!\n\n## Metroid Prime 4 news – what’s the latest?\n\nE3 2018 has been and gone without a mention of Metroid Prime 4. So what’s\ngoing on with it? In a recent interview with [Game\nInformer](https://www.gameinformer.com/interview/2018/07/01/reggie-fils-aime-\nsheds-light-on-the-future-of-switch-and-his-progress-in), Nintendo’s Reggie\nFils-Aime said that Prime 4 is “still in development and proceeding well”\ndespite radio silence.\n\n‘Last year was important to us to message to the Metroid fan that there was a\nMetroid Prime experience in development, as we showed Metroid: Samus Returns\nfor the 3DS. We didn’t want that fan to say “You just launched a new system,\nwhen are you going to bring me a Metroid on that platform?” We said it was\ncoming. This year, with so many games launching effectively between [now] and\nthe first half of next year, we wanted to focus on those games. Rest assured,\nMetroid Prime 4 is still in development and proceeding well.’\n\n## What is Metroid Prime 4?\n\nIntended as a sequel to 2007’s [Metroid Prime 3:\nCorruption](https://www.trustedreviews.com/Metroid-Prime-3-Corruption-review),\nPrime 4 is currently in development for the Switch. It remains unknown whether\nit will maintain the same gameplay formula, narrative and visual stylings of\npast entries to the series.\n\n## Metroid Prime 4 release date – When is it coming out?\n\nNot for a while. Having been announced with nothing but a brief logo and\nplatform at E3, Nintendo is yet to divulge any release details for Metroid\nPrime 4.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n**Related:[Best Nintendo Switch\nGames](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-nintendo-switch-games)**\n\n![metroid prime\n4](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\n## Metroid Prime 4 trailer – How does it look?\n\nThe announcement trailer was as cryptic as can be, teasing fans with nothing\nmore than a logo and development platform. It was more than enough, though,\nsending us into a hype-filled frenzy.\n\n## Metroid Prime 4 wishlist – What we’d love to see **  \n**  \n\n**A huge galaxy to explore**\n\nMetroid Prime 1, 2 and 3 were huge games, especially for their time.\nThroughout their duration Samus Aran would explore a range of different\nplanets, all of which felt utterly unique in their challenge and visual style.\n\nWe’d love to see the fourth instalment present a world that is even bigger. A\nsetting filled with enemies, puzzles, and secrets to discover would work\nperfectly on Nintendo Switch, lending each session a sense of rewarding\nprogression. It doesn’t need to be a traditional open-world, but something far\nvaster than previous entries.\n\n**Related:[Upcoming Nintendo Switch\nGames](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/upcoming-nintendo-switch-\ngames-2017)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Help catch up new players**\n\nIt’s hard to believe that the first Metroid Prime launched for Nintendo\nGamecube way back in November 2002. The franchise is 15 years old at this\npoint, so there are bound to be new players who have never experienced Metroid\nPrime before.\n\nNintendo should strive to re-introduce Samus Aran and her strange yet\nwonderful world in a way that leaves a substantial impact. Perhaps an in-game\ntheatre could chronicle the narrative of past games, or we could even receive\nsome [Metal Gear Solid 4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/Metal-Gear-\nSolid-4-Guns-of-the-Patriots-review)-esque flashbacks spliced into cutscenes.\n\n**A game made for Nintendo Switch  \n**  \nThe Nintendo Wii helped Metroid Prime 3: Corruption shine with some truly\ncreative usage of its motion controls. Pulling open doors, solving puzzles and\nblasting enemies proved to be incredibly satisfying. But, that was back in\n2007, and Metroid Prime 4 has a lot of catching up to do.\n\n**Related:[Bayonetta 3 latest\nnews](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/bayonetta-3-release-date-gameplay-\ntrailer-news-switch-3370469)**\n\n![metroid prime\n4](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)  \nWe’re excited to see how Metroid Prime 4 aims to make use of Nintendo Switch\nand its joy-con controllers. HD Rumble is a sleek feature we’ve only seen in\n[1-2 Switch](https://www.trustedreviews.com/1-2-switch-review) thus far, and\nit has a ton of potential in the realm of science-fiction. Rolling Samus about\nusing the joy-con or unlocking a devious door could be fun, immersive little\nways to improve gameplay.\n\nAmiibo functionality also goes without saying, with a slew of new amiibo\nlaunching alongside the game to supply the player with bonus items, weapons\nand more.  \n**  \nRelated:[Best Nintendo Switch Deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/best-\nnintendo-switch-deal-2993180)**\n\n**http://link.brightcove.com/services/player/?bctid=5624719704001**\n\n**How are excited are you for Metroid Prime 4?
