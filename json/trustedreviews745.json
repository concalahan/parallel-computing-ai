Rather, publishers have chosen to self-\ncensor, with games keeping the same story and characters with direct\nreferences to Nazism stripped out.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThe swastikas in [Wolfenstein II: The New\nColossus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/wolfenstein-2-the-new-\ncolossus), for example, were replaced with triangles, while an appearance from\nHitler is notable for the dictator’s lack of moustache.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the German games industry generally seems pretty pleased with\nthe decision to reverse the decades-old ban – and extra pleased at the tacit\nacknowledgement by the government that games are indeed an art form.\n\n“Computer and video games have been recognised as a cultural medium for many\nyears now, and this latest decision consistently cements that recognition in\nterms of the use of unconstitutional symbols as well,”\n[said](https://www.game.de/en/blog/2018/08/09/german-authorities-allow-\ninclusion-of-symbols-of-unconstitutional-organisations-in-games/) Felix Falk,\nfrom Game.de, Germany’s games industry association.\n\n**Related:**[ **Best PS4\ngames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/ps4-games-3431751)\n\n“Many games produced by creative, dedicated developers address sensitive\ntopics such as the Nazi era in Germany, and they do so in a responsible way\nthat encourages reflection and critical thinking,” he continued.\n\n“The interactive nature of games makes them uniquely qualified to spark\ncontemplation and debate, and they reach younger generations like no other\nmedium can.”\n\n**Does censorship change games?
