We dissect the latest rumours.**\n\nSpeculation has been rife about when Apple will unveil its next handsets, but\nwhile history teaches us that ‘some time in September’ is a good idea of when\nthe new iPhone will launch, we haven’t really been able to pin a date to the\nyear’s biggest smartphone reveal.\n\nUntil now?\n\nThe first [report](https://www.mac4ever.com/actu/124206_keynote-\niphone-8-le-12-septembre-se-confirme-du-cote-des-operateurs) comes to us from\nFrench fanboy blog Mac4Ever, which says ‘carrier sources’ have revealed that\nApple will be holding its next product launch on Tuesday September 12.\n\nThe site has a mixed track record when it comes to Apple rumours, but there’s\nnothing too wild about this one – Apple typically launches its new iPhones in\nthe second week of September, on either the Tuesday or the Wednesday, with\nlast year’s iPhone 7 reveal taking place on Wednesday September 7.\n\nIf accurate, that would likely mean iPhone 8 pre-orders going live on Friday\nSeptember 15, ahead of a September 22 final release date.\n\nNow, the Wall Street Journal is also\n[saying](https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-to-hold-product-launch-event-on-\nsept-12-1503928157) that September 12 is the day to mark on your calendars,\nciting “people familiar with its plans.”\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nIt’s more difficult to pick holes in the WSJ’s track record, though while it\nis reliable, it’s also not perfect. Plus, Apple likes nothing more than to\nspring a surprise, so we’d stress that nothing is set in stone until Apple\nmails out official iPhone launch invites.\n\nWe think this will happen towards the end of next week, so as to best spoil\nthe [IFA 2017](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ifa-2017-news-rumours-\nhighlights-2993271) party and put a damper on new phones from rivals like LG\nand Sony.\n\nAs well as the iPhone 8 and 7S/7S Plus, Apple is being tipped to reveal a\nspecial [10 Year Anniversary Edition\niPhone](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-10-year-anniversary-\nedition-news-rumours-price-release-date-specs-features-2951157) this autumn,\nand a host of updates to other key product lines.\n\nMost notably, these include the [Apple Watch\n3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-watch-3-release-date-\nseries-3-rumours-features-price-3196092) and a [4K Apple\nTV,](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/4k-apple-tv-release-date-news-\nrumours-specs-price-2953139) but we’re also expecting to get more details on\nits nascent [HomePod](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-homepod-\nrelease-date-price-specs-features-uk-2950931) smart home speaker.\n\nThat’s the latest news, but stay tuned as more information should become\navailable soon.\n\n**Related:[Best smartphones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nsmartphone)**\n\n**Do you think September 12 is when the iPhone 8 will be revealed?
