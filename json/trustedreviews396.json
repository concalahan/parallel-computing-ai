Luckily, we\nhave answers. Here’s all you need to know.  \n**\n\nThe new Bluetooth standard, released for use back in December 2016, promises\nquadrupled range compared to Bluetooth 4.2. Cutting-edge devices like the\n[iPhone X](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-x-release-date-specs-\nfeatures-uk-price-2951157) and [Galaxy\nS8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s8) are the first to\nthe party and can now be up to 800 feet away from compatible headphones,\nspeakers and fitness trackers while maintaining connectivity.\n\nBluetooth 5.0 also promises twice the data transfer speed of the previous\nversion.\n\nHowever, perhaps most excitingly, Bluetooth 5.0 has enough bandwidth to\nsupport two sets of wireless devices at the same time.\n\nThis could mean speakers in different rooms, or the ability to listen to\nsupport two sets of headphones without having to share a bud with your friend\n(as romantic as that is).\n\n**Related:[Apple TV 4K](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/4k-apple-tv-\nrelease-date-news-rumours-specs-price-2953139)**\n\nYes, the next Bluetooth standard, Bluetooth 5, brings with it some serious\nupgrades including increased range, speed, and broadcast messaging capacity.\nSo what exactly is Bluetooth 5 and why does it matter? Let’s start with the\nbasics before expanding.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n**What’s better about Bluetooth 5?** It’s faster, has longer range, and can\ntransfer more information.  \n**Why does that matter?** Aside from the obvious benefits, the new standard is\ngoing to help support the IoT.  \n**When is it coming out?** It’s already here!\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## What is Bluetooth?\n\nBluetooth is a wireless connection standard intended to connect disparate\ndevices and transfer data over short distances. It is fittingly named after\n10th-century king Harald Bluetooth, who united Denmark’s tribes into a single\nkingdom.\n\nBluetooth was invented by Ericsson in 1994, but it wasn’t until 1998 that the\nBluetooth Special Interest Group (Bluetooth SIG) was established by Ericsson,\nIBM, Intel, Toshiba and Nokia, and 1999 when it was initially standardised.\n\nThe Bluetooth SIG, which has since grown to some 25,000 member companies, has\noverseen Bluetooth’s development ever since.\n\nThe last major version of the standard, Bluetooth 4.0, was officially rolled\nout in 2011, while the last iterative update was Bluetooth 4.2 on December 2,\n2014. Now it’s time for Bluetooth 5 to enter the stage.\n\n**Related:[What is OLED?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/what-is-\noled-3285263)**\n\n## Where did the ‘v’ and the ‘.’ go?\n\nYou’ve probably noticed that Bluetooth SIG has dropped the .0 from the version\nnumber for Bluetooth 5, as well as the ‘v’ (it’s technically Bluetooth v4.2,\nfor example).\n\nThis is a pretty straight-forward marketing decision on Bluetooth SIG’s part,\naimed at: “Simplifying our marketing, communicating user benefits more\neffectively and making it easier to signal significant technology updates to\nthe market.”\n\nSo what does Bluetooth 5 have to offer? Here’s what we know so far.\n\n## Bluetooth 5 is faster\n\nBluetooth 5 offers twice the the data transfer speed of the previous version,\nBluetooth 4.2 while increasing the capacity of data broadcasts by 800%. With\nBluetooth 5 you can send and receive much more data much more quickly.\n\n**Related:[Best Bluetooth speakers](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-\nportable-speakers_round-up)**\n\n![Bluetooth\nspeakers](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Bluetooth 5 has longer range\n\nThe new standard is effective over four times the range of Bluetooth 4.2,\nwhich will come in particularly useful for things like portable speakers.\nYou’ll be able to wander further away with your phone without stopping the\nmusic, for example.\n\nMark Powell, executive director of the Bluetooth SIG explains: “Increasing\noperation range will enable connections to IoT devices that extend far beyond\nthe walls of a typical home.”\n\n## Bluetooth 5 is ready for the IoT\n\nBluetooth 4.2 added some features to make it work better with the so-called\nInternet of Things, and Bluetooth 5 places such functionality front and\ncentre. Of course, its extra range and capacity will help more smart household\ndevices talk to each other, but the increase to broadcast capacity means the\nnew standard will be able to communicate much more easily with IoT devices.\n\nThe Bluetooth SIG says the upgrades to range, speed, and capacity will\n“redefine the way Bluetooth devices transmit information, moving away from the\napp-paired-to-device model to a connectionless IoT where there is less need to\ndownload an app or connect the app to a device.”\n\n**Related:[Nest Thermostat review](https://www.trustedreviews.com/nest-\nthermostat-review)**\n\n![Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd-\ngen](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nPowell adds: “Bluetooth will be in more than one-third of all installed IoT\ndevices by 2020. The drive and innovation of Bluetooth will ensure our\ntechnology continues to be the IoT solution of choice for all developers.”\n\n## Bluetooth 5 boosts location services\n\nBluetooth 5 isn’t just about being faster and longer-range than before – it’ll\nalso help facilitate additional location-based functionality. In particular,\nit should boost the uptake of Beacon technology, which will result in\nsignificantly improved indoors navigation in shopping centres and the like.\n\nThis will be possible because Bluetooth 5 will add “significantly more\ncapacity to advertising transmission,” according to Bluetooth SIG. This means\nthat it will be able to convey much more information to other compatible\ndevices without forming an actual connection.\n\n![Bluetooth\nlogo](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nPrevious Bluetooth standards already do this in order to notify you about the\nname and nature of other open Bluetooth networks, but it seems Bluetooth 5\nwill be able to do much more with it.\n\nAs the Bluetooth SIG puts it: “With the major boost in broadcast messaging\ncapacity, the data being transferred will be richer, more intelligent.”\n\nBluetooth 5 will add location and navigation functionality, so that Beacons\ncan transmit custom information without connection and application barriers.\n\nIn other words, you won’t need to install an app or go through connection set-\nups in order to receive specific location-based information from Bluetooth\nBeacons.\n\n**Related:[iPhone 9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-9-release-\ndate-specs-features-price-rumours-uk-3297160)**\n\n## Your old devices probably won’t benefit\n\nWhile your existing phones, speakers and equipment may work with Bluetooth 5\ndevices, they almost certainly won’t benefit from its extra capabilities. That\nmeans you’ll need to buy all-new Bluetooth 5-ready gear to take advantage of\nits entire expanded feature set. **  \n**\n\n## Bluetooth 5 release date\n\nBluetooth 5 went live back in December 2016, and is now already available in\ndevices. Probably the biggest Bluetooth 5 news recently is that the technology\nfeatures in the Samsung Galaxy S8 and iPhone 8/iPhone X.\n\nExpect to see even more devices rock the new connectivity standard in 2018. **  \n**\n\n**Are you prepared to invest in new Bluetooth 5 kit from the off?
