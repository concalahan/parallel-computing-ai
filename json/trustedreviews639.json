That mightbe the case, but the end result is largely rubbish-sounding audio quality.The company is also dealing with complaints from users over [slow chargingspeeds](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-pixel-3-wireless-charging-problem-3609647) when using third-party wireless chargers. The Pixel Stand isthe only charger capable of wirelessly charging the Pixel 3 phones at theadvertising speeds of 10W, meaning pads from the likes of Anker are onlycapable of 5W charging.**Have you had any issues since grabbing a Pixel 3 or Pixel 3 XL?
