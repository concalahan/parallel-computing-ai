Instead, there are games that have handled\ndesign in an interesting way, with a wall devoted to different planets in\nspace-’em-up [No Man’s Sky](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/no-mans-\nsky), and another terminal showing how boss fights are constructed in\n[Bloodborne](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/bloodborne).\n\nThis focus upon several games is backed up with several smaller stands\nquerying cultural issues within games, such as diversity, sexism, violence and\npolitics.\n\nThere are playable games in the final room, a vividly coloured tornado of\narcade machines featuring weird and wonderful titles like QWOP (which I’m\nstill awful at), and a point-and-click adventure game where you’re a bear\ndriving a speedboat. It was excellent.\n\n**Read more:[Best PC games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-pc-\ngames-3520096)**\n\nNothing here is a truly deep dive into some of the games and issues, but\nthere’s a decent examination of a lot of things here, and those fascinated by\ndesign, but not familiar with video games, will find plenty to sink their\nteeth into as an examination of both how we got here, and the issues the\nindustry has to face up to in the future. Meanwhile, fans will likely\nappreciate a glimpse of some rare gaming artefacts from the last decade.\n\n[Design/Play/Disrupt](https://www.vam.ac.uk/exhibitions/videogames?gclid=Cj0KCQjww8jcBRDZARIsAJGCSGtvr3EIECwIxdrIGVQM8fR5lPRX0gysrVdlELosJaCg_V1uLk9J7HsaAht6EALw_wcB)\nopens on September 8, and runs until February.
