As predicted, and heavily leaked,\nthere are no huge surprises this year. Instead, Samsung has tweaked and fine-\ntuned an already excellent phone by improving the camera and adding a few\nextras. Keep on reading for the full comparison.\n\n## **Samsung Galaxy S9 vs S8 design – What’s new?**\n\nThe [Samsung Galaxy S8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-\ngalaxy-s8) represented a huge step forward in industrial design for the South\nKorean company and signalled a shift in the way phones look. The awkward bezel\nwas minimised, with metal and glass becoming the materials of choice.\n\n**Related:[Samsung Galaxy S9 first\nlook](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAfter receiving such a makeover, it was always likely that the device that\nfollowed the S8 would look very much alike. That is indeed the case with the\nS9, which looks pretty much identical to its predecessor.\n\nSamsung said it has reduced the top and bottom bezel slightly, and you’ll\nnotice the fingerprint sensor has been shifted so that it sits below the\ncamera module. There’s also now a front-firing speaker in the mic on the top,\nrather than just that middling bottom-facing one.\n\nBoth phones include a 3.5mm headphone jack, IP68 water-resistance, a microSD\nslot for storage expansion and a USB-C port for charging.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Call of Cthulhu](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Call of Cthulhu\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/call-of-cthulhu \"Call of Cthulhu\")\n\n  * [ ![iPad Pro 2018](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: MySmartPrice / @OnLeaks \n\n### New iPad Pro 2018 leak shows Apple is almost certainly dropping the Home\nbutton\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ipad-pro-2018-release-date-specs-\nprice-3482812 \"New iPad Pro 2018 leak shows Apple is almost certainly dropping\nthe Home button\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Pete Lau on stage at the OnePlus 6T launch](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### The OnePlus 6T ditched the headphone jack, CEO Pete Lau tells us why\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ceo-pete-lau-oneplus-6t-headphone-jack-\nwireless-charging-3612475 \"The OnePlus 6T ditched the headphone jack, CEO Pete\nLau tells us why\")\n\n  * \n\n### Best Samsung Galaxy S9 Deals\n\n[](https://public.eagleapi.io/magpie/time-inc/trusted-\nreviews/AUTO/link?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.awin1.com%2Fcread.php%3Fawinaffid%3D277673%26awinmid%3D380%26clickref%3Dtr-\nnewmobiledeals-s9%26p%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%252Fextras%253Ftariffcode%253DDD1YMFEB18%2526giftcode%253DNA16%2526productcode%253DVODSMGAS9BLA&clickref=flamingo&referrer=https://cms.trustedreviews.com/deals/samsung-\ngalaxy-s9-deals-3402357)\n\n[](https://public.eagleapi.io/magpie/time-inc/trusted-\nreviews/AUTO/link?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.awin1.com%2Fcread.php%3Fawinaffid%3D277673%26awinmid%3D380%26clickref%3Dtr-\nnewmobiledeals-s9%26p%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%252Fextras%253Ftariffcode%253DDD1YMFEB18%2526giftcode%253DNA16%2526productcode%253DVODSMGAS9BLA&clickref=flamingo&referrer=https://cms.trustedreviews.com/deals/samsung-\ngalaxy-s9-deals-3402357)\n\n###\n\n[Samsung Galaxy S9 – 4GB data on Vodafone (use code TRUSTED10 to save £10)\n\n](https://public.eagleapi.io/magpie/time-inc/trusted-\nreviews/AUTO/link?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.awin1.com%2Fcread.php%3Fawinaffid%3D277673%26awinmid%3D380%26clickref%3Dtr-\nnewmobiledeals-s9%26p%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%252Fextras%253Ftariffcode%253DDD1YMFEB18%2526giftcode%253DNA16%2526productcode%253DVODSMGAS9BLA&clickref=flamingo&referrer=https://cms.trustedreviews.com/deals/samsung-\ngalaxy-s9-deals-3402357)\n\nIf you don't need a lot of data and want to cut your monthly cost right down,\nthis is a great choice with a low overall TCO.\n\n[Mobiles.co.uk\n\n](https://public.eagleapi.io/magpie/time-inc/trusted-\nreviews/AUTO/link?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.awin1.com%2Fcread.php%3Fawinaffid%3D277673%26awinmid%3D380%26clickref%3Dtr-\nnewmobiledeals-s9%26p%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%252Fextras%253Ftariffcode%253DDD1YMFEB18%2526giftcode%253DNA16%2526productcode%253DVODSMGAS9BLA&clickref=flamingo&referrer=https://cms.trustedreviews.com/deals/samsung-\ngalaxy-s9-deals-3402357)\n\n|\n\n£150 upfront w/code\n\n|\n\nNow £23pm\n\n[View Deal](https://public.eagleapi.io/magpie/time-inc/trusted-\nreviews/AUTO/link?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.awin1.com%2Fcread.php%3Fawinaffid%3D277673%26awinmid%3D380%26clickref%3Dtr-\nnewmobiledeals-s9%26p%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%252Fextras%253Ftariffcode%253DDD1YMFEB18%2526giftcode%253DNA16%2526productcode%253DVODSMGAS9BLA&clickref=flamingo&referrer=https://cms.trustedreviews.com/deals/samsung-\ngalaxy-s9-deals-3402357)\n\nNow £23pm\n\n|\n\n£150 upfront w/code\n\n|\n\n[Mobiles.co.uk\n\n](https://public.eagleapi.io/magpie/time-inc/trusted-\nreviews/AUTO/link?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.awin1.com%2Fcread.php%3Fawinaffid%3D277673%26awinmid%3D380%26clickref%3Dtr-\nnewmobiledeals-s9%26p%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%252Fextras%253Ftariffcode%253DDD1YMFEB18%2526giftcode%253DNA16%2526productcode%253DVODSMGAS9BLA&clickref=flamingo&referrer=https://cms.trustedreviews.com/deals/samsung-\ngalaxy-s9-deals-3402357)\n\n## **Samsung Galaxy S9 vs S8 specs – What new features have been added?**\n\nWhile there are plenty of new features to get excited about with the S9,\nthere’s also plenty that’s remained the same.\n\nThe 5.8-inch – or 6.2-inch, if you go Plus – is the same size and features the\nsame quad-HD+ resolution as the previous device. Battery sizes haven’t changed\neither, so we wouldn’t expect too much improvement when it comes to endurance.\nQi wireless charging remains, and we haven’t had confirmation yet on whether\nthe charging speed has been altered.\n\n![Galaxy S8\ndeal](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: Max Parker – Trusted Reviews\n\nIn probably the most predictable update, the S9 and S9 Plus improve upon the\nSnapdragon 835/Exynos 8895 chip with the latest versions. If you’re in Europe\nyou’ll get the Exynos 9810, while the US will get the Snapdragon 845.\nImprovements with these new chips include faster download speeds, superior CPU\nand GPU performance along with better efficiency.\n\nRAM on the regular S9 remains at 4GB like the S8, but the S9 Plus gets 6GB.\nStorage remains at 64GB, although there will now be a 256GB option for the S9\nand S9+.\n\n| **Samsung Galaxy S9** | **Samsung Galaxy S8**  \n---|---|---  \n**Battery** |  3000 mAh | 300mAh  \n**Camera (Rear)** |  12MP f/2.4 and f/1.5 | 12MP f/1.7  \n**Display** |  5.8-inch OLED (1440 x 2560) | 5.8-inch OLED (1440 x 2560)  \n**Processor** |  Snapdragon 845/Exynos 9810 | Snapdragon 835/Exynos 8890  \n**Storage** |  64GB | 64GB  \n**RAM** |  4GB | 4GB  \n  \n##\n\nAmong the bigger changes are the improved speakers, which now fire sound\ndirectly at you rather than into your palm. These new speakers have been tuned\nby AKG and support [Dolby Atmos](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/what-\nis-dolby-atmos-2942509) for 360-degree sound. On first listen not only do the\nspeakers appear louder, they’re more more detailed than before too.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe other huge change, and the primary focus of the S9, is the camera. The\n12-megapixel sensor now has a clever mechanical aperture shift that will move\nbetween f/2.4 and f/1.5, depending on your environment.\n\nWhen it’s bright and sunny it will utilise the f/2.4 aperture, with the wider\nf/1.5 kicking in when things get darker or you’re inside. This should result\nin fantastic shots during the day, but equally impressive ones in the tougher\nconditions that most smartphone cameras would struggle in. The S8 did have a\n12-megapixel sensor, but the aperture was a fixed f/1.7.\n\n4K video can now be shot at 60fps, rather than just 30fps, and slow-motion can\nbe cranked all the way up to 960fps for a very short time. Like the S8, the S9\ncan also shoot in 120fps and 240fps in 1080p.\n\nBixby, Samsung’s virtual assistant, is available on both phones and can be\naccessed via a dedicated button.\n\n## **Samsung Galaxy S9 vs S8 price – Which is better value?**\n\nPrices for the Samsung Galaxy S9 start from £739 for the 64GB model. That’s an\nincrease over the £689 price of the Galaxy S8 at launch. Note, however, you’ll\nbe able to pick up an S8 for a lot less than that now – and that price will\nlikely further come down once the S9 hits shelves.\n\n**Exclusive deal:[Get the Samsung S9 for £39/month £125 upfront, with 16GB\ndata](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=380&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-s9deal&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fsamsung-\ngalaxy-s9-black%3Ftariffcode%3DDGCYMFEB18)**\n\n### The top Samsung Galaxy S8 deals right now\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-S8Deals&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fsamsung-\ngalaxy-s8)\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-S8Deals&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fsamsung-\ngalaxy-s8)\n\n###\n\n[ Samsung Galaxy S8 – 4GB, £23/month and £5 upfront (with code TRUSTED10) on\nVodafone\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-S8Deals&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fsamsung-\ngalaxy-s8)\n\nA fantastic offer for anyone in the market for a low data contract on a\nSamsung Galaxy S8.

There are plenty of tweaks that address issues we experienced with\nthe previous handset – and that’s always a good thing.\n\n**Share your thoughts on the all-new Galaxy S9 with us @TrustedReviews.**\n\n"}
