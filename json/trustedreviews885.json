Here’s everything that’s new in Android 8.1 plus\nkey details on installing the latest version of Android O.\n\n## What’s new in Google’s Android 8.1 Oreo update?\n\nAndroid 8.1 Oreo was designed to improve on the shortcomings of Android 8.0\nOreo – but that’s not to mean it doesn’t bring any new features to the table,\nbecause it does.\n\nThe most notable addition is a refreshed cheeseburger emoji. Yes, you read\nthat right. Google CEO Sundar Pichai actually made good on his comical promise\nto redesign the icon, placing the cheese (correctly) above the meat patty. And\nthe other main change is that the accompanying beer is now full, rather than\nhalf-empty.\n\nOK, maybe that was a bit of an exaggeration. The release is actually headlined\nby Google’s new Neural Networks API, which allows applications to take\nadvantage of hardware acceleration, reducing latency and network loads.\n\nThat’s closely followed by Big G’s decision to open its Pixel Visual Core co-\nprocessing technology to third-party developers, letting them utilise its\nadvanced machine learning algorithms and image processing tools.\n\nWhat does that mean for the average consumer, you ask? Well, in addition to\ntaking advantage of a slew of smarter applications, they’ll finally be able to\nshoot in HDR+ outside of Google’s native camera application.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Google Home Hub YouTube](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Will Google Home Hub ever get Netflix?

It started rolling out for the [Nexus\n5X](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nexus-5x), [Nexus\n6P](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nexus-6p),\n[Pixel](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel), [Pixel\nXL](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-xl), [Pixel\n2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-2), and [Pixel 2\nXL](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-2-xl) on December 5 –\nand should reach near-stock Android smartphones in the near future.\n\nThose in possession of a more heavily-skinned handset from a third-party\nmanufacturer – an [LG G6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/lg-g6) or a\n[Samsung Galaxy S8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s8),\nfor example – will probably need to wait a bit longer for the release to\narrive, though, as it’ll have to be integrated into existing overlays.\n\n**Related:[Best Android phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nandroid-phones-1)**\n\n## How do I download Android 8.1 Oreo on my smartphone?\n\nIf you have reason to believe the Android 8.1 Oreo upgrade is making the\nrounds for your smartphone, head into _Settings_ , followed by _About Device_\n, then tap _Download Updates Manually_ to check to see if it’s ready.\n\n**Related:[Android Oreo features](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/android-\noreo-features-3266704)**\n\n**What do you think of the new features in Android 8.1 Oreo?
