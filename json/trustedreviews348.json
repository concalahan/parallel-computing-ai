Note, however, that the narrower aperture on this sensor does makeit pretty much useless in anything but the best of light.BlackBerry Mobile also uses the secondary sensor to enable a portrait mode,allowing that faux-bokeh effect to blur the background. Not a single phone hasreally mastered this effect yet, and while the Key2’s effect is passable, itstill feels very fake. Highly detailed areas such as hair strands often missthe blur and I’ve found you need to hold the phone super-still for decentresults.Video isn’t anything to write home about, either. It can shoot up to 4K at24fps, but in my opinion you’re better off sticking to 1080p at 60fps unlessyou want shaky footage. The lack of OIS becomes very obvious when shootingvideo.## **BlackBerry Key2 – Battery life**There are a number of factors that help the Key2 to impress with its batterylife. The unit itself is pretty large at 3500mAh, while the Snapdragon 660forgoes the best performance for endurance. This is helped, too, by a screenthat’s smaller than much of the competition.But in my opinion, the real reason I’ve achieved around a day and a half ofpower from the Key2 is that the device just isn’t particularly good at tasksthat would normally eat through battery, hence I avoid them.I haven’t been watching YouTube videos, for example, nor have I been playingany games or editing photos. This is a great phone, if you like the keyboard,for messaging and ‘getting stuff done’ – but it’s limited in other areas.Still, the battery life is decent. The Key2 will make it through the day on asingle charge even with a few hours of calls and heavy messaging on multipleplatforms without you every worrying about hitting the red.Charging up the phone takes around 90 minutes with the supplied USB-C plug andcable.## **Why buy the BlackBerry Key2?**There’s no denying it: the Key2 is a niche product that will only appeal toBlackBerry die-hards and those who use their phone purely as a messaging andemail device. Some of the software additions are nice, but they’re unlikely towin over those have no desire to switch back to device with a physicalkeyboard.At £599, the Key2 is a tough sell, despite it righting many of the wrongs withthe KeyOne by improving the design and upping the RAM.There are too many other phones I’d recommend at this price. The [OnePlus6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/oneplus-6) is £100 cheaper andbetter in nearly every sense, while the [HuaweiP20](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/huawei-p20-pro) and [LGG7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/lg-g7) are similarly priced andagain much better picks.But if the keyboard is what you want then the Key2 is really your only choice– and at least that keyboard is very good.## **Verdict**For BlackBerry die-hards only.## Score  ### Score in detail  * Performance 8  * Camera 7  * Design 7  * Battery Life 8  * Value 6  * Software 8  * Calls & Sound 8  * Screen Quality 8"}
