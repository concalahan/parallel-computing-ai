For instance, a review might report that a monitor\ncan cover only 60% of the sRGB colour space, so it’s bad, or 100% of AdobeRGB,\nso it’s good. But what is colour space, and why does it matter? Read on to\nfind out.\n\n## What is a colour space?\n\nDescribed simply, colour space refers to a set of colours that define some\nsort of standard. That standard could be anything – from a set of colour\nswatches used to show different available paint colours, to the digital\nrepresentation of colour used in PCs.\n\nIn this sense, a colour space is aiming to ensure a level of consistency, so\nyou can be sure that your choice of paint will work in your dining room, or\nthat you can plug almost any monitor into any PC and it will display colours\nas they’re supposed to look.\n\n****\n\nWhere things become more complicated is when looking at the more exact\ndefinition with reference to computers.\n\nIt all starts with a colour model. This is an abstract, mathematical way of\ndefining colour, with the two most common being RGB (red, green, blue) and\nCMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow and key – or black). RGB is used for computer\ndisplays where each pixel is made up of a trio of red, green and blue dots,\nwhile CMYK refers to the four standard colours used in printers: cyan,\nmagenta, yellow and key (black). An RGB representation of black is (0,0,0)\nwhile red would be (255,0,0).\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nSuch a model on its own is abstract, with no specific relation to real-world\ncolours. As such, a true colour space is defined by mapping that colour model\nto a standard real-world colour reference standard.\n\nThe most common of these is the CIE XYZ colour space, which defines the number\nof colours the human eye can distinguish in relation to the wavelengths of\nlight. Developed back in the 1930s, this model is generally represented in 2D\nas a horseshoe shaped spread of colour on an XY axis.\n\n![CIExy1931](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)_The CIExy colour space.

Other colour spaces can\nthen be mapped onto this ideal representation of all the colour we can see.\n\n**Related:[Monitor refresh rate\nexplained](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/144hz-monitors-refresh-rate-\nmotion-blur-explained \"Monitor refresh rate explained\")**\n\nThis mapping, known as the colour gamut, is defined mathematically, but can\nalso be visualised as an area – generally a triangle – that sits inside the\nCIE XYZ colour space. The bigger the triangle, the greater range of colours in\nthat colour space.\n\n![colour\nspaces](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)_Colour spaces.

The\nformer is the universally accepted standard for most computing applications\nand the internet. However, it covers only about 30% of the CIE XYZ colour\nspace.\n\nMeanwhile, Adobe RGB was developed to better represent the full range of\ncolours achievable on CMYK printers. This means it can show a larger range of\ncolours (about 50% CIE XYZ), with the most obvious advantage being in the\ncyan-green hues.\n\nThis is what is being referred to when monitors are said to be ‘wide gamut’.\nIt means they’re able to cope with the extra colours that colour spaces such\nas Adobe RGB require.\n\nAll this may seem to suggest that buying a high-gamut monitor that can deliver\nAdobe RGB colour is the best option. However, this isn’t just an over\nsimplification; it’s wrong.\n\nSince nearly all screens – from phones to TVs – conform to the sRGB colour\nspace, you actively don’t want to be using an Adobe RGB monitor to edit\npictures and video if its intended use is for all those other sRGB screens,\nsince all the colours will look wrong on those displays.\n\nMoreover, because Windows doesn’t natively recognise the Adobe RGB colour\nspace, using an Adobe RGB monitor for your PC will result in your monitor\nmaking colours look over-saturated; this is because the monitor is taking\nnormal sRGB colours and stretching them out to fit the Adobe RGB space. It\nwill only be in certain apps that recognise Adode RGB, such as Photoshop, that\ncolours will look correct.\n\n**Related:[Best free photo editing\nsoftware](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/photoshop-free-alternatives-\ndownload \"Best free Photo editing\")**\n\nAs such, you should only buy a monitor capable of producing Adobe RGB – or any\nother extended colour space – if you have a specific reason to work within\nthat colour space: for example, if you’re dealing with high-end printers used\nin magazine production or if you work in cinema and broadcast TV.\n\nThe only exception to this is Mac users. Since macOS natively recognises Adobe\nRGB, it can properly support high-gamut monitors for all apps. This means you\ncan buy a high-gamut monitor and everything should look normal until you use\nan app that specifically extends into the high-gamut range, at which point\nyou’ll get the benefit of the monitor’s extended capability. PC users can also\njust switch a high-gamut monitor into a low-gamut mode.\n\n## Colour space and colour depth\n\nRelated to colour space is the idea of colour depth. In any digital\nrepresentation of colour, each colour is represented by a number, and the\ntotal number of colours is finite. If you look back at old computers and games\nconsoles, you’ll see the limited palette of colours available. That was\nbecause the processors at the time weren’t powerful enough to cope with the\ncalculations required to show millions of colours all the time.\n\nNowadays, most computers work with colour that’s 24-bit, which means each red,\ngreen and blue sub-pixel can be at one of 256 brightness levels, making for a\ntotal of 16,777,215 colours.\n\n![Bit\ndepth](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)_The image on the right has a higher bit depth.\nCredit: Thegreenj – Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0,\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=2048094_\n\nCrucially, this range of numbers is the same whether you’re working in a\nsmaller or larger colour space. As such, Adobe RGB is theoretically inferior\nto sRGB when it comes to showing fine differences in colour, since its great\nrange means that steps between colours are greater. In reality, such\ndifferences are all but indistinguishable to the human eye.\n\nAlso, inside monitors you’ll find look-up tables (LUTs). These are used to\nperform calculations and changes on the image – if you want to tweak the\ncontrast or adjust the RGB settings to get the white-point of the monitor\nlooking correct, for example. On low-bit LUTs (typically 8-bit), making\nchanges can result in a reduction of the resultant bit-depth of the image. As\nsuch, high-end monitors use high-bit LUTs (12 or 14-bits) to ensure they can\nstill produce every colour accurately, even after adjustments are made.\n\n## Colour coverage\n\nLooking back to those percentage figures mentioned at the top of this article.\nThese refer to the number of colours that a monitor can show in any given\ncolour space. Most decent normal monitors will cover 100% of the sRGB colour\nspace, which translates to about 70% of the Adobe RGB space.\n\nThis means that the monitor is able to show every possible colour in the sRGB\nspace and, as such, it should provide good image quality – assuming contrast,\nviewing angles and all the other factors hold up too.\n\nIf you’re looking to work with Adobe RGB images, you need a monitor that can\ndisplay 100% of Adobe RGB.\n\nAt the other end of the scale, cheaper monitors struggle to deliver 100% of\nsRGB. Anything above 90% is fine, but the displays included on cheap tablets,\nlaptops and monitors may only cover 60-70%. The result of this is visible\ncolour banding, where what should be a fine gradient of changing colour is\nbroken up into clearly visible steps.\n\nThis most often happens because, while the monitor can process a high bit-\ndepth, its pixels can’t actually display that depth. A 24-bit colour panel\nuses 8 bits for each colour, but many cheap displays can only control their\npixels to an accuracy of 6 bits per colour.\n\nTo get round this, monitor manufacturers sometimes use ‘dithering’, which is\nwhere neighbouring pixels are alternate between two colours to approximate the\ncolour you’re after. This can be surprisingly effective and can fool measuring\nequipment such as colorimeters into thinking the monitor can achieve 100%\ncoverage – although, in general, the dithering effect can be visible to the\nnaked eye, appearing as a slightly less stable and clear image.\n\n![Dithering](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)_An extreme example of dithering_\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn the end, there are two key things to keep in mind when it comes to colour\nspaces and buying a new monitor: coverage and high gamut. If quality is key\nthen opt for a monitor that can cover 100% of the sRGB colour space using a\nproper 8-bit panel. If you’re less concerned about accurate colours then, for\nmost uses, you can get away with screens with as low as 70% sRGB coverage.\n\nMeanwhile, if you know you’ll be working with a workflow that requires\nalternative colour spaces, then you’ll want to pick up a high-gamut monitor.\nMac users can get away with buying high-gamut monitors even for normal use,\nalthough there’s no point unless you do intend to use other colour spaces at\nsome point. PC users should actively avoid buying high-gamut monitors unless\nneeded.\n\n"}
