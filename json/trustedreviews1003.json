Now, the Wi-Fi Alliance\nhas done a major service to consumers by simplifying the naming of its Wi-Fi\nspecifications. Meet Wi-Fi 6…**\n\nUnless you’re lucky enough to be able to own a home where you can wire\nEthernet from room to room (and if you do, we seriously envy you), then\nchances are you’re probably relying on Wi-Fi for the majority of your internet\nusage.\n\nPrior to the arrival of 802.11ax (now Wi-Fi 6), most users were relying on\n802.11ac (renamed Wi-Fi 5), a standard that was first released in 2013, and\nfrankly it was time for the 1.3Gbps standard to get an upgrade.\n\n## 802.11ax Speeds: How fast is the new Wi-Fi 6 standard?\n\nWhether you call it Wi-Fi 6 or 802.11ax, the newer standard offers theoretical\nspeeds of up to 10Gbps, whilst also lowering power consumption as part of the\ndeal.\n\nThe main way it increases speed is by fully combining the 2.4GHz and 5GHz\nspectrum bands. Previously, 802.11ac and 802.11n (or Wi-Fi 4) were forced to\nwork on the two bands separately, but the new standard will utilise them\nsimultaneously. MU-MIMO technology will also be enabled for uplink data, in\naddition to the downlink data it already supports.\n\n**Related:[Best routers](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-routers)**\n\n## 802.11ax vs 802.11ac: Should I upgrade from Wi-Fi 5 to Wi-Fi 6?\n\nNot every Wi-Fi standard is for everyone. The also recently released 802.11ad\nstandard, for example, only offers a benefit if your device is in the same\nroom as your Wi-Fi access point because the frequency band it uses (60GHz) is\nunable to penetrate through walls. It doesn’t get a rebrand, as it’s not\ndeemed widely used enough to merit the simplified nomenclature.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nIn contrast, the 802.11ax or Wi-Fi 6 standard offers offer speed increases to\npretty much everyone. Eventually, it’s going to be an essential upgrade.\n\nRight now, though?\n\nIt’s hardly compulsory for most internet users. Since the standard was only\nrecently confirmed, most of the hardware that currently supports it is\nunlikely to be able to fully utilise the huge gains offered by Wi-Fi 6. More\nrobust chips, based on a deeper understanding of the new standard, are needed\nfor router manufacturers to capitalise on its huge potential – and that’s\nstill something of a work in progress.\n\nIn other words, don’t expect consumer hardware that really makes the most of\nWi-Fi 6/802.11ax to surface until 2019. Even then, you probably don’t want to\nthink about spending any money until your most important devices _also_\nsupport the standard. That means no upgrading until at least your laptop and\nmaybe your phone are Wi-Fi 6 compatible.\n\nIt’s going to take some time to see the benefits of 802.11ax, or Wi-Fi 6 to\nuse its snazzy new moniker, but it’s nice to know that it’s there waiting for\nus.\n\n**Will you be making the upgrade to the new Wi-Fi standard, and what do you\nmake of the new Wi-Fi 6 name?
