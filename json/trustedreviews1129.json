Here’s the low-down:\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n  * **App Actions and Slices** – Android P introduces two ambitious UI changes: Actions and Slices. The former is analogous to Actions on Google Assistant, while the latter is a subset that can surface core features from an application when conducting a device-wide search.\n  * **Digital Wellbeing** – There’s a Dashboard application baked into Android P that lets you monitor your usage and set restrictions. You can, for example, tell it to restrict access to Netflix after using it for two hours. Or even to strip colour from your handset after a specific time to encourage you to put it down.\n  * **Do Not Disturb (DND)** – Do Not Disturb is far more aggressive in Android P. When enabled, notifications will now disappear altogether. The only way an alert will come through is if it’s triggered by a starred contact, and even then it’s restricted to a phone call; no text messages.\n  * **Navigation** – Google has done away with the standard on-screen navigation buttons in Android P, in favour of a lone Home button that relies on multitasking to navigate; sliding the Home button to the right, for example, lets you cycle through recent applications.\n  * **Overview** – There’s a new Overview screen built into Android P that’s essentially a multitasking hub. There’s a Search bar at the top and a row of predictive applications at the bottom, generated using the aforementioned Adaptive Applications algorithm.\n\nBig G also launched the Android P Beta for the Essential Phone PH-1, Google\nPixel, Google Pixel XL, Google Pixel 2, Google Pixel 2 XL, Nokia 7 Plus,\nOnePlus 6, Oppo R15 Pro, Sony Xperia XZ2, Vivo X2 and Xiaomi Mi Mix 2S at I/O\n2018. Head over to Google’s Beta [website](http://android.com/beta) for\ninstructions on how to install it.\n\nBut we still don’t know what it will be called…\n\n### Google Assistant\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nGoogle Assistant has been treated to a huge\n[overhaul](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-assistant-voices-john-\nlegend-3469636). There are six new voices to choose from, as well as a revised\nuser interface that will be available on both Android and iOS when it launches\nlater in 2018. It’s a lot smoother than the existing interface, putting AI at\nthe centre of the experience.\n\nBut that isn’t the best bit. Google Assistant will soon (no word on when) be\nable to make calls for you. And no, we aren’t kidding.\n\nGoogle showed a [demonstration](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-\nassistant-update-2018-3469629) of Assistant calling a hair salon to book an\nappointment during its I/O Keynote. Assistant had a back-and-forth\nconversation with the receptionist, speaking like a human; it processed\nquestions on the spot and offered up intelligent and unnervingly normal-\nsounding responses within a matter of seconds.\n\nThe firm will also use the feature to update business listings in Search.\n\nIf you aren’t convinced the opening hours for an establishment listed on\nGoogle Maps is correct, for example, you’ll have the option to command the\ncompany’s in-house Assistant to contact the business to verify the\ninformation. It will then update the listing accordingly for the whole world\nto see. Crazy stuff, right?\n\nLast, but not least, Google is arming Assistant with the facility to have a\nnatural back-and-forth conversation. The feature will arrive in the coming\nweeks, providing you with the option to request additional information after\nyou’ve submitted a request. You’ll also be able to ask more than one question\nat once.\n\n### Google Photos\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nGoogle [announced](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-photos-\ncolourise-pictures-black-white-3469620) that a slew of new features are headed\nto Google Photos at I/O 2018, the most notable of which is the option to add\nrealistic-looking colour, using AI, to black-and-white pictures. There’s also\na new Smart Actions tool that can determine who’s in an image, offering to\nshare it with those people.\n\nOh, and it will soon be able to recognise documents and convert them to PDFs,\nand let you know when it thinks an image needs to be brightened or rotated in\norder to make it look better.\n\n### Google News\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nA [new version](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-news-\nredesign-3468753) of Google News was showcased during Google’s I/O Keynote.\nIt’s designed to merge the client’s core features with the best of the\nstandalone Newsstand application, while at the same time placing emphasis on\nimages and YouTube videos.\n\nThe biggest change, however, is that News is now driven by AI. AI that intends\nto weed out fake news and understand you better.\n\nGoogle says it uses artificial intelligence to not only surface stories you’re\ninterested in, but to ensure you only see relevant and high-quality content.\nThat’s further reinforced by the introduction of Snapchat Stories-style\nNewscasts, which you can swipe through for key snippets before you actually\nopen an article.\n\n## Google I/O 2018 Explained – What is Google I/O?  \n\nGoogle I/O is the name of Google’s annual Developer Conference, where the firm\ndiscusses the future of the various products and services in its ecosystem.\nThis year, it’s being held at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View,\nCalifornia, but it’s also live-streamed for loyal fans around the world to\ntune in and watch.\n\n## Google I/O 2018 Dates – When is Google I/O?  \n\nGoogle I/O will run from **May 8** through **May 10** and, as you’d expect,\nthe tech giant has plenty planned for the gathering.
