We sent out a survey to members of ourcommunity and found that 60% of people were already using wireless headphones.“Whether we do this now or three years in the future, there will always bepeople who are very vocal against such change.”**Related:[Best WirelessHeadphones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/wireless-headphones-bluetooth-3450127)**Referring to the company’s own wireless Bluetooth headphones, which launchedalongside the [OnePlus 6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/oneplus-6)and received a new colourway at the launch of the 6T, Lau also joked that, “Ifit [removing the headphone jack] pushes people to buy more [BulletsWireless](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/oneplus-bullets-wireless),then great!”## OnePlus 6T: Why is there no wireless charging?Although the OnePlus 6 brought about a change in the company’s phones to aglass-backed design, neither it nor its successor, the OnePlus 6T, supportswireless charging. Samsung has offered the feature on every one of the GalaxyS and Note devices since the [GalaxyS6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s6) and Apple’s 2017iPhones onwards, along with this year’s [Google Pixel3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-3), have all adoptedthe feature too, so what gives?Lau echoed Huawei’s stance. He said OnePlus wouldn’t implement wirelesscharging until it thought the technology was mature enough to offer anexperience worthy of OnePlus users’ expectations.He added: “The technology for wireless charging is not terribly complex – wecould implement it, but we haven’t wanted to. It’s too slow and we don’t thinkit drives the value that we want for our users.”**Related:[Best Wireless Chargers](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-wireless-charger-3505891)**Sat beside Qualcomm’s President, Cristiano Amon, Lau also stated that:“Qualcomm might have a solution that works, that can deal with the heat andother drawbacks of current technology.”So there you have it. While it doesn’t look like the 6T was ever destined tooffer wireless charging, OnePlus’ CEO isn’t against the idea. However, hewants the technology to reach a point where OnePlus considers it a worthwhileaddition.**What do you think?
