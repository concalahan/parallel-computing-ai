By today’sstandards, this is incredibly limited, and wouldn’t stand up to the plate in2016. Ubisoft has the opportunity to craft a truly unique customisation systemwith Beyond Good and Evil 2, putting you in the shoes of a badass spacephotojournalist.Just imagine all the things you could enhance and personalise. Jade’s camera,staff and outfit are begging to be kitted out with new skills and aesthetics.The possibilities are quite staggering, and that’s without having mentionedher hovercraft or potential spaceship. Your gear could even have differentstat bonuses and variants, changing how you approach combat and navigatecertain environments.**Innovative player choice**Jade could influence the world of Hylis using her Iris Network Reports in thefirst game, convincing the masses into siding with her and forming apassionate rebellion. This was an interesting mechanic, ushering in ageneration of player choice that can still be felt today. Beyond Good and Evil2 could revitalise this in some fascinating ways, letting you choose how andwhy you want to influence the world around you.Jade’s position as a budding photojournalist is one that allows the narrativeto take liberties that other games would outright avoid. She could stir up arevolution from nothing with just a camera and her wits, cementing her placein the game’s world as a genuinely monumental figure. If Beyond Good and Evil2 does away with Jade altogether, we’d love to see another character pick up asimilar torch._**What would you like to see in Beyond Good and Evil 2?
