Despite having Apple’s famous chic\nand wealth of top-end hardware, the device was let down by one of the worst\nbattery lives we’ve seen in a flagship smartphone. As a result, we mainly\nrecommended buyers who could afford it to go for Apple’s pricier and larger\n[iPhone 7 Plus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-7-plus) phablet.\n\nThis year Apple seems to have learned from its mistakes and thrown everything\nbut the kitchen sink at its latest trio of smartphones, the [iPhone\n8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-8-release-date-specs-rumours-\nprice-uk-2993101), iPhone 8 Plus and anniversary-edition [iPhone\nX](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-x-release-date-specs-features-\nuk-price-2951157). Featuring top tech, Apple’s soon-to-be-released [iOS\n11](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/ios-11) software, and pretty much\nevery feature fans have wished for over the last 12 months, all the iPhones\nlook set to be contenders for Phone of the Year.\n\nBut with the iPhone priced out of most regular buyers’ budget and the other\ntwo being at first glance very similar, knowing which iPhone is best for you\nis a tricky question to answer. Here to help we’ve created a definitive guide,\nbreaking down what’s different between the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus.\n\n### Trusted Reviews Exclusive iPhone XS Deal\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n###\n\n[Apple iPhone XS – 10GB, £40pm with £350 upfront on O2\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\nGiving you plenty of data for the low price of just £40 a month, this monthly\ncontract with O2 is an incredible deal that can't be missed if you want to be\none of the first people to own an iPhone XS.\n\n[Mobiles.co.uk\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n|\n\n£350 upfront\n\n|\n\n£40/month\n\n[View\nDeal](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n£40/month\n\n|\n\n£350 upfront\n\n|\n\n[Mobiles.co.uk\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n## **O2 Tariff Offers**\n\nTrusted Reviews has partnered with O2 to offer you tariff deals for must have\nproducts.\n\n**Buy Now:[Apple iPad Pro 10.5 (2GB) from £40/month, upfront £29.99 at\nO2](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3235&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-O2deal&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.o2.co.uk%2Fshop%2Ftablets%2Fapple%2Fipad-\npro-10.5-inch%23contractType%3Dpaymonthly%3F)**\n\n**Buy Now:[Apple iPad 9.7 (2GB) from £27/month, upfront £5.99 at\nO2](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3235&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-O2deal&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.o2.co.uk%2Fshop%2Ftablets%2Fapple%2Fipad-9.7%23contractType%3Dpaymonthly%3F)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n## iPhone 8 vs iPhone 8 Plus: What’s the difference?\n\nFrom a distance both iPhones look pretty similar. Both have a reworked mixed-\nmaterial design, featuring a custom glass back and front and aluminium sides.\nSome people may bemoan the move to glass, fearing the ever-present threat of\ncracking that an accidental drop poses, but Apple claim the iPhone 8 and\niPhone 8 Plus’ skin is “the most durable glass in a smartphone” thanks to the\nuse of a special laser-welded steel-and-copper reinforcing structure.\n\nWe’re not sure we’d want either to have an accidental meeting with a pavement,\nbut glass definitely looks nice and has also let Apple build the Qi open\nwireless charging standard into both iPhones, which is supported in many\nairports.\n\n### The top iPhone 8 deals right now\n\n[](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3202&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-\nnewmobiledeals-\niphone8&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fcontract%2Fiphone-8-64gb-space-\ngrey%2Fee-essential-plan-15gb-43-24mths-24)\n\n[](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3202&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-\nnewmobiledeals-\niphone8&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fcontract%2Fiphone-8-64gb-space-\ngrey%2Fee-essential-plan-15gb-43-24mths-24)\n\n###\n\n[iPhone 8 64GB Space Grey – 45GB of data on EE\n\n](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3202&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-\nnewmobiledeals-\niphone8&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fcontract%2Fiphone-8-64gb-space-\ngrey%2Fee-essential-plan-15gb-43-24mths-24)\n\nMore data than you can shake a stick at combined with absolutely nothing to\npay up front.

Once again\nthey both don’t feature a 3.5mm headphone jack, which will remain an annoyance\nfor audiophiles.\n\nSadly, unlike their pricier iPhone X sibling, neither new iPhone has made the\nswitch to an OLED panel, and use the same IPS screen tech as older iPhones.\n\n**Related:[Best smartphones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nsmartphone)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe only major differences between the two is that the iPhone 8 has a smaller\n4.7-inch Retina display and single-lens camera setup, while the iPhone 8 Plus\nhas a larger 5.5-inch Retina display and dual-lens system.\n\nThe iPhone 8 will have a standalone 12-megapixel rear camera, while the iPhone\n8 Plus will have a more impressive dual-lens rear camera with OIS that pairs a\n12-megapixel ƒ/1.8 lens with a telephoto ƒ/2.8 lens.\n\nApple claims it’s managed to improve the iPhone 8’s image quality using a new\nISP processor for photography that will let it capture 80% more light than the\nold iPhone. But the 8 Plus’ extra tech means it will likely be much better in\ndifficult lighting conditions and has a few custom camera features you won’t\nget on the basic iPhone 8.\n\nThe coolest looking of these is a new Portrait Lighting mode. Available in the\nPortrait menu of the camera app, the mode maps a subject’s face using the two\nlenses and then you can adjust settings to create a variety of advanced\nlighting effects.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n_iPhone 8 Plus_\n\nBoth iPhones will be sold with identical 64GB and 256GB storage options.\nThere’s no word on how big each phones’ battery is.\n\n**Related:[Best phablet](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nphablets-2015)**\n\n## iPhone 8 vs iPhone 8 Plus: Which phone is more powerful?\n\nApple never discloses its iPhones’ full specifications at launch, so we can’t\nfully comment on which is more powerful. But from what little we know both\nphones should be a lot faster than their predecessors, thanks to their use of\nApple’s brand-spanking-new A11 Bionic CPU. Both the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus\nrun using the new 64-bit CPU which has a slightly atypical hexa-core design\nthat pairs two high-performance cores with four high-efficiency cores. Apple\nclaims the cores are 70% faster than the A10’s and is significantly more power\nefficient.\n\nThe iPhone 8 and 8 Plus also feature a new Apple-designed three-core GPU that\nthe company claims is three times faster than the A10’s graphics. If any of\nthe performance claims ring true the two phones should be serious performers\nand deal with everything from hardcore gaming to 4K video recording and multi-\ntab web browsing hassle-free. The only potential performance differentiation\nbetween the two will be memory. In the past the Plus iPhone variants have\nalways had more RAM than their smaller siblings.\n\n**Related:[iPhone 9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-9-release-\ndate-specs-features-price-rumours-uk-3297160)**\n\n**For a full spec comparison, check out the table below:**\n\n|  iPhone 8 | iPhone 8 Plus  \n---|---|---  \n**Screen** |  4.7-inch Retina Display |  5.5-inch Retina Display  \n**Display Resolution** |  1334 x 750 |  1920 x 1080  \n**Aspect Ratio** |  16:9 |  16:9  \n**Primary Camera** |  12-megapixel rear camera, ƒ/1.8 |  Dual lens rear\ncamera: 12MP, ƒ/1.8 with telephoto, ƒ/2.8 (OIS)  \n**Secondary Camera** |  TBA |  TBA  \n**Chipset** |  A11 Bionic |  A11 Bionic  \n**RAM** |  TBA |  TBA  \n**Storage** |  64GB/256GB |  64GB/256GB  \n**Battery Capacity** |  TBA |  TBA  \n**Waterproof?** |  Yes |  Yes  \n**Fingerprint Scanner?** |  Yes |  Yes  \n**Headphone Jack?** |  No |  No  \n**Primary Port** |  Lightning | Lightning  \n**Iris Scanner?** |  No |  No  \n**Wireless Charging?** |  Yes |  Yes  \n**Micro SD Slot?** |  No |  No  \n**Dimensions** |  TBA |  TBA  \n**Weight** |  TBA |  TBA  \n**Software** |  iOS 11 |  iOS 11  \n  \n**Related:[Best iPhone](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-iphone)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## iPhone 8 vs iPhone 8 Plus Summary\n\nBoth the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus follow the same format as their\npredecessors. Featuring a larger screen, more advanced camera, the iPhone 8\nPlus will likely be a better choice for phablet fans and people who care about\ncamera tech, but with pricing starting at $799, it’s $100 more expensive than\nthe basic iPhone 8.\n\nWith the added allure of the even more swanky iPhone X further complicating\nthings, this could make the basic iPhone 8 the default choice for most buyers\nwhere budget is a concern, though we won’t know this until we’ve had a chance\nto test all the new iPhones.\n\n**What do you think of the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus?
