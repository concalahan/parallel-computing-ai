And our one to\navoid? A light-up sports jacket that’s really a bit of a dim idea.\n\n**Related:[The MVR Ascend is a British-made Gear VR\nrival](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/the-mvr-ascend-h1-lets-you-\nplay-gta-5-in-vr-on-ps4-xbox-one-and-pc-immerse-yourself-in-this-week-s-\nfeatured-kickstarter)**\n\n## What is SkunkLock?\n\nIt might look like a regular U-lock, but SkunkLock is a security measure with\na difference.\n\nWith the right tools, any bike lock can be cut in under a minute – so buying a\nstronger lock won’t necessarily stop your bike being stolen.\n\nEmbracing the theory that attack is the best form of defence, SkunkLock sprays\nwould-be thieves with an emetic chemical deterrent, incapacitating them before\nthey can make away with your wheels.\n\nGo ahead punk, make our day.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n## Why is it interesting?\n\nBecause no other lock fights back quite like this.\n\nWhat exactly is it that thieving scoundrels have to contend with? A face full\nof a proprietary compound called Formula D_1 that causes shortness of breath,\npotentially compromises the thief’s sight, and can induce vomiting. Don’t\nworry though, it’s all completely legal – according to the manufacturers,\nanyway…\n\nThe noxious gas itself is stored within a pressurised container which, when\ncompromised – with an angle-grinder, say – releases into the air and causes\nthe would-be thief to turn and flee.\n**[](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/aer-lets-you-lob-your-gopro-into-the-\nair-and-is-our-kickstarter-of-the-week)**\n\nIt’s a pretty hard-wearing lock in its own right, with the crossbar being made\nof high tensile steel and the lock bar composed of hardened medium-carbon\nsteel. There are no electronics to be disabled, either, and it comes with\nmultiple sets of keys in case you lose them.\n\nThe SkunkLock branding features in big red and white letters, too, which will\nhopefully prove to be a deterrent once word spreads amongst the local\nhoodlums.\n\nWorried about releasing the gas on yourself? You needn’t be, as the unpleasant\nchemicals are kept safely within a hollow chamber and only released if someone\ntries to cut through it.\n\n**Related:[AER lets you lob your GoPro into the\nair](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/aer-lets-you-lob-your-gopro-into-the-\nair-and-is-our-kickstarter-of-the-week)**\n\n![skunklock-\nlocked](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## What are the challenges?\n\nCrowdfunding isn’t like buying a product off the shelf – when you back a\nproject, you’re offering financial support to its creators and their idea. As\nsuch, there’s no guarantee the product will ever be shipped to you, so bear\nthis in mind before backing any crowdfunded project.\n\nSkunkLock is listed on Indiegogo, and you learn more about its [backer\npolicies and advice here.](https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-\nus/articles/526816-How-to-Evaluate-a-Campaign)\n**[](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/big-i-is-a-robot-butler-for-the-\nhome-and-this-week-s-featured-kickstarter)**\n\nWhile Skunklock is legal in the US, it’s not allowed to be sold in some states\ndue to the fact some versions contain capsaicin compounds (these regulations\nwere set up with pepper spray in mind). Hence it may also be banned in some\ncountries.\n\nThere’s also no guarantee Skunklock will stop someone stealing your bike,\nit’ll just make it much harder for them. What’s more, it’s more complex to\nmanufacture than a standard U-lock, but the makers claim they have set\nrealistic benchmarks for distribution.\n\nAll being well, it should ship in June next year.\n\n**Related:[We all secretly want a robot butler – which is why we love\nBig-i](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/big-i-is-a-robot-butler-for-\nthe-home-and-this-week-s-featured-kickstarter)**\n\n## Is there anything similar available?\n\nNo. You can buy a [lock alarm](http://chainspeed.co.uk/xena-xx6-yellow-disc-\nlock-\nalarm/?gclid=Cj0KEQjw4rbABRD_gfPA2-uQqroBEiQA58MNdEd4H9BdOnsGlRUkwNKU3Wwnvz3gpv6aN_AkiiA0KZ8aApiE8P8HAQ)\nfor your bike that’ll sound if anyone tries to steal it, and [this\nenterprising person](http://www.instructables.com/id/How-To-End-Bike-Theft-\nThe-Honeybike-Project/) has hooked up a system that gives wannabe thieves\nelectric shocks (as did [these\nfellows](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3400163/What-happened-buddy-\nPranksters-set-push-bike-release-electric-shocks-try-steal-LA-street.html) in\nLos Angeles). **[](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/ccrov-the-world-s-\nfirst-underwater-4k-drone-makes-a-splash-as-our-featured-kickstarter)**\n\nBut a lock that sprays noxious chemicals? It’s never been done before.\n\n**Related:[CCROV is the world’s first underwater 4K\ndrone](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/ccrov-the-world-s-first-\nunderwater-4k-drone-makes-a-splash-as-our-featured-kickstarter)**\n\n![skunklock-\nlong](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Should I crowdfund this?\n\nAnyone who’s ever had their bike stolen will know just how annoying it is. If\nyou want to deter anyone from making off with your ride, then it seems a good\nshout.\n\nThe cheapest early bird has sold out, but you can pick one up for $109 (£89).\nThat’s 32% cheaper than the full retail price when it lands next summer.\n\n## And one to avoid this week…\n\n[Fanight](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/fanight-the-world-s-only-self-\nilluminating-jacket--2#/). It’s a sports jacket that lights up. It absorbs UV\nlight during the day and converts it into light it can emit at night.\n\nOr you could just buy a brightly-coloured jacket…\n\nYour call.\n\n**Watch The Refresh: The best tech gossip and reviews every week  \n**\n\n**Let us know what you think of this week’s featured crowdfunding campaign in\nthe comments below.**  \n ****\n\n"}
