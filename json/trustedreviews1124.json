Almost a year on\nfrom its original launch, the Pixel 2 has stood the test of time well and is\nstill one of the best small-form-factor Android phones around. Despite being\nmore expensive we’d still recommend it over Apple’s dinky [iPhone\nSE](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-\nsehttps://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-se), which finally got pushed\noff Apple’s website with the arrival of the new [iPhone\nXS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xs), [iPhone XS\nMax](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xs-max) and [iPhone\nXR](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-xr-release-date-specs-\nprice-3579137), all of which are, without question, large handsets.\n\nWith long-term use, battery degradation is starting to rear its ugly head, but\nthe Pixel 2’s performance and camera remain top notch and easily match newer\nphones such as the [Galaxy S9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-\ngalaxy-s9), [OnePlus 6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/oneplus-6) and\neven the aforementioned XS.\n\nHowever, with the Google Pixel 3 set to make its debut on October 9 and the\ncompany charging a reduced but still hefty £629 for the Pixel 2, its time in\nthe sun is coming to a close. We’d recommend waiting to see what the Pixel 3\nbrings to the table as a result. If that’s not an option, read on for an in-\ndepth look at how the Pixel 2 compares to this year’s flagships.\n\n## Pixel 2 – Design\n\nThe Pixel 2’s design was pretty old-fashioned when it first launched in\nOctober 2017. Midway through 2018, it sticks out like a sore thumb, especially\nwhen stood next to other flagships, like the [Huawei\nP20](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/huawei-p20) and iPhone XS. Instead\nof having a mixed metal and glass body, the Pixel 2 is mainly made from\naluminium.\n\nThe back has a stone-like finish. It’s harsh and textured; strange at first\nbut, ultimately, nice to handle. It offers far more grip than shiny aluminium\nand isn’t as slippery when sat on a table the same way a glass back is.\n\nThe only design flourish is the glass ‘visor’ that sits just above the metal\nmain body, covering the camera sensor and flash. Aside from adding contrast to\nthe metal, this is where all the cellular and WiFi antennas live.\n\nGiving them plenty of space should help connectivity, but it also means there\nare no antenna bands elsewhere. Over the last year the glass has proved\nsurprisingly scratch-resistant but be warned, a single drop can turn it into a\nmosaic pattern of cracks. The below happened after a two-foot fall from a\ncoffee table onto a wooden floor.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\n**Related:[Best smartphones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nsmartphone)**\n\n![Google Pixel\n2](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2018/05/Broken-\nPixel-2-1024x682.jpg)\n\nThe front also feels a little old-fashioned. Unlike the Pixel 2 XL or [Samsung\nGalaxy S9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s8), the\nPixel 2 has a huge chin and forehead above and beneath its 5-inch display. The\nbezel here is more substantial than seen on the likes of the [iPhone\n8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-8). Overall, the Pixel 2\nisn’t much smaller than the Samsung Galaxy S9 or Huawei P20, but those sport\nmuch bigger 5.8-inch screens.\n\nIt seems odd that Google has taken this design route, especially since more\nand more device makers are opting for a bezel-less look. At least Google has\nused that extra space on both ends of the phone to add dual front-facing\nstereo speakers – but it’s still hard to forgive.\n\nThe Pixel 2 lags behind most flagships with IP67 (rather than some\ncompetitors’ [IP68)](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/what-is-ip68-ip-\nratings-explained-2947135) dust and water resistance but the practical\nimplications of a lesser IP rating are slight and having something is\nundoubtedly better than nothing.\n\nAnother, less desirable trend that Google has decided to follow is the removal\nof the headphone jack. I can only assume that the decision was taken to help\nfacilitate the phone’s water resistance but it’s a shame nonetheless. Even\nthough you get a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter in the box and there are plenty of\n‘Made for Google’ USB-C headphones out there, it’s still annoying.\n\n## Google Pixel 2 – Screen\n\n![Google Pixel\n2](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/10/DSCF9267-1024x683.jpg)\n\nThere isn’t a whole lot to get excited about with regards to the Pixel 2’s\nscreen. As in the first iteration of the device, it’s a 5-inch, 1080p AMOLED\npanel that looks good but you couldn’t call it stunning.\n\nAMOLED panels are renowned for offering more saturated colours, perfect blacks\nand better contrast over their LCD counterparts, but Google likely opted for\nOLEDs on both Pixel 2s as it’s necessary for [Daydream\nVR](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/daydream-vr-3148686) – which received\na big push around the phone’s launch.\n\n**Related:[Best VR headset](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-vr-\nheadset)**\n\nI’m a huge fan of AMOLED displays but they’re not perfect. The panel on the\nPixel 2 edges towards the warm side, so you’ll likely find that whites will\nhave a slightly orange tinge. Note that Google doesn’t offer any option to\nadjust colours on the display, which is annoying if you prefer a slightly\ncooler screen.\n\n### Best Google Pixel 2 & Pixel 2 XL Deals\n\n[](https://www.giftcloud.com/uk/affiliates/mobilescouk/1125/capture?anpid=277673)\n\n[](https://www.giftcloud.com/uk/affiliates/mobilescouk/1125/capture?anpid=277673)\n\n###\n\n[Google Pixel 2 XL – 4GB, £23pm, £310 upfront on Vodafone (Exclusive £25 gift\ncard)\n\n](https://www.giftcloud.com/uk/affiliates/mobilescouk/1125/capture?anpid=277673)\n\nA great deal on the Pixel 2 XL with a nice and low monthly cost.

The ability to play back HDR10 and Dolby Vision content\nfrom the likes of Amazon and Netflix is available on the [Galaxy Note\n9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-9), [LG\nG7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/lg-g7) and [Apple’s iPhone\nXS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xs) – but it isn’t available\non the Pixel 2. This is by no means a deal-breaker but it’s an odd feature to\nleave out when Google Play Movies and YouTube offer HDR support.\n\n[ Next  \nPerformance and Software ](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-\npixel-2-performance-and-software)\n\n"}
