Note:** _Apple has discontinued the iPhone X, replacing it with the\nnewer[iPhone XS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-xs-release-date-\nspecs-price-uk-3551351)._\n\n## **What is the iPhone X?**\n\nApple’s latest flagship the iPhone X (pronounced iPhone 10 not iPhone ‘ex’) is\na vital device that will almost certainly shape the design of the iconic\nseries going forward.\n\nIt ditches the tired design of the [iPhone\n8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-8) and [iPhone 8\nPlus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-8-plus), reducing the\nbezel and giving it a much needed modern look.\n\nAs good as the iPhone X is though, it’s not perfect. It also comes at a cost\nthat might instantly put you off.\n\n**Related:[iPhone XS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-xs-release-\ndate-specs-price-uk-3551351)**\n\n### Trusted Reviews Exclusive iPhone XS Deal\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n###\n\n[ Apple iPhone XS – 10GB, £40pm with £350 upfront on O2\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\nGiving you plenty of data for the low price of just £40 a month, this monthly\ncontract with O2 is an incredible deal that can't be missed if you want to be\none of the first people to own an iPhone XS.\n\n[Mobiles.co.uk\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n|\n\n£350 upfront\n\n|\n\n£40/month\n\n[View\nDeal](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n£40/month\n\n|\n\n£350 upfront\n\n|\n\n[Mobiles.co.uk\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-\niPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-\nspace-\ngrey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)\n\n## **iPhone X – Design**\n\nApple has been coasting for too long with the design it introduced for the\niPhone 6, but that all changes with the iPhone X – in a big way. You don’t\nneed me to tell you the iPhone X is a huge departure from the iPhone design of\nold – just look at the pictures. Not only does it look good, however; Apple\nhas done a fantastic job at actually making it feel really good too.\n\n**Related:[Is the OnePlus 6 the ultimate budget\nsmartphone?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/oneplus-6)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n###  Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nThis phone is simply gorgeous. It’s slightly taller than the iPhone 8 (and 7\nand 6) but much narrower and smaller than the iPhone 8 Plus. It strikes the\nperfect balance, especially since you’re getting a 5.8-inch display here.\n\n![iPhone\nX](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nThe aluminium sides have been swapped out for stainless steel – as seen on\nthe[ Apple Watch](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/apple-watch-2) – and\nthe front and rear of the device are glass. I received the Silver variant for\nreview – and, unfortunately, it wasn’t long before it was covered in\nfingerprints, those shiny sides being a particular magnet. This is a phone\nthat looks fantastic straight after a wipe-down; not so much a few hours after\nit’s been in your greasy palms.\n\nAlso of concern is how the iPhone X will fare over time. No matter how\nunscientific they might be, drop tests indicate that the finish here doesn’t\nlend itself well to wear and tear. After all, the stainless steel Apple Watch\nI’ve been using is a scratched-up mess. As a result, my iPhone X has spent\nmuch of its time inside an Apple case, but this certainly sees it lose points\nin the glamour stakes.\n\nIt’s around the front of the iPhone X that the magic happens, though. The\niPhone 8 has an extensive bezel running around the display, but the iPhone X\ndoesn’t. Similar to the[ Samsung Galaxy\nS9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9), Apple has\npushed out the screen to the edges here, significantly reducing the bezel. A\nnoticeable black border remains, but it adds a nice contrast to the bright\ndisplay.\n\nThe lack of a thick bezel means there’s no room for the Home button, a feature\npresent on every single iPhone iteration until now. As a result, there’s no\nTouch ID fingerprint scanner. Instead, the iPhone X sees Apple introduce\nfacial recognition – a bold move.\n\nAll of the components for Face ID (infrared camera, flood illuminator, dot\nprojector) are housed in what’s affectionately being called the ‘notch’.\nYou’ll find the notch at the top of the display, where it somewhat disrupts\nthat all-screen look. There’s been much controversy concerning the notch with\nregards to it completely ruining the immersive experience. Once you begin\nusing the phone, however, I’ve found that it simply blends into the\nbackground. The notch has become common sight since the iPhone X came out and\nAndroid phones like the [LG G7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/lg-g7)\nand [Huawei P20](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/huawei-p20) have both\nbrought the design trait across.\n\nSure, you notice it when the screen is on, plus it juts into video if you’re\nplaying something full-screen. But in all other instances it fades into the\nbackground. Certain apps – Apple’s Music being one – use software trickery to\nblank out the notch, and some apps clearly need to be updated to ensure\nimportant buttons aren’t hidden by it.\n\n### Top iPhone X deals right now\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=3202&clickref=TR-\nBestMobileDeals&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fapple%2Fiphone-x-64gb-\nspace-grey)\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=3202&clickref=TR-\nBestMobileDeals&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fapple%2Fiphone-x-64gb-\nspace-grey)\n\n###\n\n[iPhone X 64GB – 60GB of data on EE\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=3202&clickref=TR-\nBestMobileDeals&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fapple%2Fiphone-x-64gb-\nspace-grey)\n\nWith 60GB in your pocket each month, you'll never be left scrounging for any\ndata, plus, with no upfront costs there's a lot to love about this contract\nfrom EE.\n\n[Buymobiles.net\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=3202&clickref=TR-\nBestMobileDeals&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fapple%2Fiphone-x-64gb-\nspace-grey)\n\n|\n\nNo upfront\n\n|\n\nNow £58/month\n\n[View\nDeal](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=3202&clickref=TR-\nBestMobileDeals&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fapple%2Fiphone-x-64gb-\nspace-grey)\n\nNow £58/month\n\n|\n\nNo upfront\n\n|\n\n[Buymobiles.net\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=3202&clickref=TR-\nBestMobileDeals&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fapple%2Fiphone-x-64gb-\nspace-grey)\n\n**Related:[iPhone Black Friday\ndeals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/iphone-black-friday-\ndeals-3597079)**\n\n![iPhone\nX](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nIn the space either side of the notch you’ll find the battery indicator and\ntime. Annoyingly, you can no longer see the battery percentage remaining or\nwhether you have a pair headphones connected without opening the Control\nCenter. The bigger annoyance is that the battery and signal indicators aren’t\nin line with the bottom of the notch, so they dip slightly below and look\nrather weird.\n\nI do feel that the notch gives the iPhone X a bit of character and a\ndistinctive look, something lost by the dismissal of the Home button. I’m sure\nApple would get rid of it in an instant if it could cram this tech inside the\nbezel; but it does feel as though the company wants to use it as a\ndistinguishing feature while it’s here.\n\n![iPhone X\nback](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## **iPhone X – Face ID**\n\nI’ve used Samsung’s face unlock and iris scanners a fair bit, and have never\nbeen particularly impressed by either their speed or accuracy. So it was\nimportant that Apple’s Face ID worked every single time.\n\nIt works accurately in both the light and dark; it can’t be fooled by pictures\nor masks; and it works if you’re wearing glasses too. There have been reports\nthat twins have fooled it, and Apple told me some IR-blocking sunnies won’t\nwork, but these are limited scenarios. Note that you need to be ‘actively\naware’ for it to work – you can’t just shove it in someone’s face and expect\nit to unlock.\n\n![iPhone\nX](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nThe ‘notch’ is where all the Face ID bits are housed\n\nFace ID isn’t perfect, though, but then neither was Touch ID; the fingerprint\nscanner was poor if your fingers were slightly greasy or wet. This isn’t a\nproblem now. However, I have found that Face ID struggles if my eyes are a\nshrivelled mess, usually first thing in the morning, and if the phone isn’t\nclose enough to my face. If you’re the type of person who tries to sneak a\nlook at their notifications with your phone at pocket-level then you’re out of\nluck.\n\nApps that previously used Touch ID as a means of unlocking will automatically\nbe replaced by Face ID without the need for an update, and you can of course\nuse it for Apple Pay payments too.\n\n### Top iPhone X deals right now\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=3202&clickref=TR-\nBestMobileDeals&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fapple%2Fiphone-x-64gb-\nspace-grey)\n\n[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=3202&clickref=TR-\nBestMobileDeals&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fapple%2Fiphone-x-64gb-\nspace-grey)\n\n###\n\n[iPhone X 64GB – 60GB of data on EE\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=3202&clickref=TR-\nBestMobileDeals&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fapple%2Fiphone-x-64gb-\nspace-grey)\n\nWith 60GB in your pocket each month, you'll never be left scrounging for any\ndata, plus, with no upfront costs there's a lot to love about this contract\nfrom EE.\n\n[Buymobiles.net\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=3202&clickref=TR-\nBestMobileDeals&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fapple%2Fiphone-x-64gb-\nspace-grey)\n\n|\n\nNo upfront\n\n|\n\nNow £58/month\n\n[View\nDeal](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=3202&clickref=TR-\nBestMobileDeals&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fapple%2Fiphone-x-64gb-\nspace-grey)\n\nNow £58/month\n\n|\n\nNo upfront\n\n|\n\n[Buymobiles.net\n\n](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=3202&clickref=TR-\nBestMobileDeals&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fapple%2Fiphone-x-64gb-\nspace-grey)\n\n## **iPhone X – Screen**\n\nThe iPhone X sees Apple switch out its usual LCD screen tech for an OLED panel\nfor the first time. Samsung, Google and many other Android phone makers have\nbeen using this technology for some time now, and it’s nice to see Apple\nfinally joining the fray with a product other than the Apple Watch. This is\nalso the highest-resolution screen ever on an iPhone, with a slightly odd 2436\nx 1125 pixels, plus there’s support for the DCI P3 colour gamut and Dolby\nVision HDR.\n\nOLEDs offer better contrast, true blacks and a more colourful picture, but\nthey’re not always perfect. The LG panels used by Google in the[ Pixel 2\nXL](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-2-xl) have come in for\nplenty of criticism for poor viewing angles and an odd blue tinge. Even the\nexcellent screens on the Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus are prone to suffering\npoor viewing angles.\n\nApple’s OLEDs come from Samsung, and while there’s a small shift to blue if\nyou tilt the device off-axis, it’s far less noticeable than on the Pixel 2 XL.\nApple says it’s made a fair few tweaks to this panel, and the company’s\noptimisation of it is certainly different to Samsung’s approach for its own\nGalaxy S9 and Note 8 panels. Colours on the iPhone X are more natural and the\nsaturation isn’t quite so intense.\n\n![iPhone X Dolby\nVision](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe iPhone X’s screen also benefits from True Tone, which alters the screen\ntemperature depending on the environment you’re in. 3D Touch makes a return,\ntoo, allowing you to perform alternative actions on applying different levels\nof pressure on the screen.\n\nWhether or not you’re a fan of the iPhone X’s display will come down to what\nfeatures you value most in a screen. For me, this is the best screen on any\nhandset I’ve seen. I downloaded a few HDR-enabled movies from iTunes –\nsomething you can’t do on Android – and they’re stunning. I wouldn’t normally\nwatch an entire film on a sub 6-inch screen, but on the iPhone X I did – and I\nwasn’t distracted by the notch at all.\n\n[ Next  \nPerformance and Software ](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-x-\nperformance-software)\n\n"}
