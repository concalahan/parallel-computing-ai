LG’s OLEDs, called POLED (that P is for plastic),just aren’t as good. It’s the same panel type that let the [Pixel 2XL](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-2-xl) down. Peopleoften conclude that OLED is always better than an LCD, but viewing the V30’sdisplay, I’d have been happier with the iPhone 8 Plus’ screen – which is LED.Following the blueprint set by the [Samsung GalaxyS8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s8) and [iPhoneX](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-x), the V30 stretches thedisplay out to the corners, reducing the distracting bezel. As a result, theV30 has an 18:9 aspect-ratio as opposed to the typical 16:9.The panel is taller, which means it’s great for reading and multitasking, butless so for video. In YouTube, for example, there will be chunky black barssitting either side of the video.[ Next  Software and Performance](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/lg-v30-software-and-performance)"}
