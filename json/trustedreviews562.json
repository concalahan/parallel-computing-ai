The chancellor says the tax is expected to add an extra £400m a year\nto the Treasury’s coffers.\n\nDuring his budget speech to Parliament, Chancellor Philip Hammond said tax\nrules have not kept pace with the digital economy, but the new digital sales\ntax will help to redress the balance.\n\nHe said: “The rules of the game must evolve now if they are to keep up with\nthe digital economy.\n\n“Digital platforms delivering search engines, social media and online\nmarketplaces have changed our lives, our society and our economy, mostly for\nthe better. They also pose a real challenge for the sustainability and\nfairness for our tax system… the rules have not kept pace.”\n\nThose campaigning for tech giants to pay their fair share of tax are unlikely\nto be pleased that the likes of Amazon will not be required to pay more on\nonline sales. In August, it was revealed Amazon paid just £4.6 million in\ncorporation taxes for its 2017 earnings. That was a dramatic fall from the\nprevious year’s contributions of £7.4m.\n\n**Related:[Best VPN](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-vpn-3470328)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Hyperkin Xbox One Duke Controller](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n###  Hyperkin Xbox One Duke Controller\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/hyperkin-xbox-one-duke-controller\n\"Hyperkin Xbox One Duke Controller\")\n\n  * [ ![Call of Cthulhu](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Call of Cthulhu\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/call-of-cthulhu \"Call of Cthulhu\")\n\n  *   * [ ![iPad Pro 2018](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: MySmartPrice / @OnLeaks \n\n### New iPad Pro 2018 leak shows Apple is almost certainly dropping the Home\nbutton\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ipad-pro-2018-release-date-specs-\nprice-3482812 \"New iPad Pro 2018 leak shows Apple is almost certainly dropping\nthe Home button\")\n\n  * \n\nThat’s despite the company’s UK profits almost trebling to £72.4m, from £24.3.\nAmazon has said it pays all of the tax owed in the UK.

We may have to look at\ntemporary tax measures to rebalance the playing field until we can get\ninternational agreements sorted out.”\n\n**Do you think the measures announced today are fair?
