Both Huawei and Docomo teams have made tremendous\nefforts. I look forward to even more impressive results when we move to the\nnext phase of field trial in Japan.”\n\n**Related:[Best Android Smartphones 2015](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-\nandroid-phones-1_round-up)**\n\nUnfortunately, we’re still years off from having 5G networks in the UK.\n\nRegardless, it’s a good sign that when the next generation of cellular data\nnetworks land here in Blighty, we can expend very respectable download speeds.\n\n“This joint field trial represents a significant advance toward fulfilling\nHuawei’s commitment to developing 5G technology standards before 2018,” said\nDr. Wen Tong, CTO of Huawei Wireless.\n\nTong added: “Results like these show we are making rapid progress and are on\nthe right path. I am confident that was we have learned here will be reflected\nin even more innovative technological advances as we continue working on 5G\nresearch.”\n\n**Check out our smartphone buyer’s video guide below:**\n\n"}
