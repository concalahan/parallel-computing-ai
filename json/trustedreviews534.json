If you want to go that extra\nstep, then why not make your home haunted through the use of smart technology?\nIn this video guide, we’ll show you how to create a haunted smart Halloween\nhome.**\n\nWe used a combination of Philips Hue lights, IFTTT and Apple HomeKit to\nautomate our smart home. Starting out, moving up to the front door, a red\nlight comes on to scare people. As you move through the house, a [Neato Botvac\nD5 Connected](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/neato-\nbotvac-d5-connected) robot vacuum cleaner turns on and drives a ghoul down the\ncorridor.\n\nInto the kitchen, and the [Philips\nHue](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/philips-hue) lights are controlled\nby the OnSwitch app, automatically turning lights on and off, while scary\nmusic plays through [Apple\nHomePod](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/apple-homepod) speakers.\n\nThe result is a fun and chilling atmosphere that trumps sticking a candle in a\npumpkin any day. And, it’s genuinely terrifying in a way that’s hard to\nachieve with dumb light bulbs.\n\nIt’s all great fun and, most importantly, doesn’t need any new kit to make it\nwork: in fact, you can probably replicate a lot of what we’ve done with the\nkit that’s already in your home. Watch the video below to see the house in\naction and the full details on how we created it.\n\n**What else could we do? Let us know @trustedreviews**\n\n"}
