We’ve outlined the key differences\nbetween the OnePlus 5 and iPhone 7 to help you make the right choice.**\n\nApple’s iPhone turns 10 years old this year, so it’s no surprise that the new\n[iPhone 7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/iphone-7-review) is a pretty decent\nhandset – albeit for its underwhelming battery life. It looks great, offers\nslick performance, and has all the software charm we’ve come to expect from\nApple over the years.\n\nBy contrast, OnePlus didn’t even exist 10 years ago. But ever since the\n[OnePlus One](https://www.trustedreviews.com/oneplus-one-review) launched back\nin the heady days of 2014, OnePlus has moved from strength to strength, now\ncounting itself amongst the chief phone makers of our time. Pairing high-end\nspecs with wallet-coddling price points, OnePlus has built a name for itself\non the back of affordable flagship handsets – the latest of which is the\n[OnePlus 5](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/oneplus-5-release-date-specs-\nrumours-price-uk).\n\nHere are the key differences between the two phones.\n\n  * **Buy now:** [**iPhone 7 (3GB) on 02 for £27/month, £75 upfront**](https://www.awin1.com/pclick.php?p=20444929633&a=277673&m=422&clickref=tr-mobiledeals-iphone7)\n  * **Buy now:[iPhone 7 (10GB) on O2 for £35/month, £79.99 upfront](https://www.awin1.com/pclick.php?p=21395919345&a=277673&m=2264&clickref=tr-mobiledeals-iphone7)**\n\n**Related:[iPhone 8 release\ndate](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-8-release-date-specs-rumours-\nprice-uk)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n![cats](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)_OnePlus 5_ **  \n**\n\n## OnePlus 5 vs iPhone 7 Design: What’s the difference?\n\nApple hasn’t changed its phone design much lately, and with good reason: the\niPhone 7 is a slick handset that takes all the best bits from the [iPhone\n6S](https://www.trustedreviews.com/iphone-6s-review), and improves on them.\nGone are the awkward antenna lines and headphone jack, as Apple aims for\naesthetics over utility.\n\nThe device is a lightweight 138 grams, and measures just 7.1mm thin, which\nmeans it’s amongst the thinnest and lightest flagship smartphones available\ntoday. It fits in your pocket with ease, and looks about as inoffensive as a\nsmartphone can, boasting gently curving edges and a camera that only barely\nprotrudes.\n\nOne of the big pulling factors for the style-conscious who are considering the\niPhone 7 is the wide range of colours on offer this time around. Apple is\npeddling a record six colours total, including Jet Black, Black, Silver, Gold,\nRose Gold, and Red.\n\n![iPhone 7S\n7](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)_iPhone 7_\n\nBut the OnePlus 5 is also a slick bit of kit, touting a similarly svelte and\ncurvaceous chassis. The phone is heavier at 153 grams, and negligibly thicker\nat 7.25mm, but that’s probably down to the larger screen – 5.5 inches versus\n4.7 inches.\n\nThis increased size will probably sit better with phone users who have become\naccustomed to having more screen real estate. Most phones tread well above\nfive inches these days, so it felt curious to see Apple retaining a smaller\nform factor.\n\nIt’s impossible to say which phone is more attractive, because they look\nlargely similar. The real question simply comes down to how big you like your\nphones – for some the iPhone will be too small, while others may find the\nOnePlus 5 to be awkward and cumbersome.\n\n## OnePlus 5 vs iPhone 7 Specs: Which phone is more powerful?\n\nWhen it comes to basic display specifications, the OnePlus 5 wins out. Not\nonly is the display bigger, but it offers a Full HD resolution of 1920 x 1080\npixels. That’s compared to the iPhone 7’s comparatively lowly 1334 x 750\npixels. This means the OnePlus 5 offers a decent 401ppi pixel density, far\nhigher than the 326ppi you’ll get from the iPhone 7.\n\n![cats](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)_OnePlus 5_\n\nThe OnePlus 5 is powered by a [Snapdragon\n835](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/snapdragon-835-phones-processor-\nspecs-speed-benchmark-chipset-cores) processor, which is Qualcomm’s latest and\nmost powerful mobile chipset. It’s an octa-core chip clocked at 2.45GHz, and\nhas featured in other flagships, most notably the critically acclaimed\n[Samsung Galaxy S8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-s8-review).\n\nThe iPhone 7, meanwhile, runs Apple’s custom-built A10 Fusion chip, which has\nfour cores and a clock-rate of 2.34GHz. While it’s a nippy chip, we’d expect\nthe OnePlus 5 to be more powerful. That’s because the Snapdragon 835 is built\non a highly efficient 10nm manufacturing process, which means more transistors\ncan be squeezed into the same space. Compared to the A10 Fusion’s 16nm\nprocess, we’d expect to see significantly higher performance or power\nefficiency.\n\nOnePlus also wins out on memory and storage, rocking 6GB and 8GB RAM options,\nand 64GB or 128GB storage options. Apple only offers one 2GB memory\nconfiguration with the iPhone 7, but has a wider range of storage variants:\n32GB, 128GB, and 256GB. However, Apple’s storage options are all more\nexpensive than the equivalent OnePlus 5 model.\n\n  * **Buy now:** [**iPhone 7 (3GB) on 02 for £27/month, £75 upfront**](https://www.awin1.com/pclick.php?p=20444929633&a=277673&m=422&clickref=tr-mobiledeals-iphone7)\n  * **Buy now:[iPhone 7 (10GB) on O2 for £35/month, £79.99 upfront](https://www.awin1.com/pclick.php?p=21395919345&a=277673&m=2264&clickref=tr-mobiledeals-iphone7)**\n\n![iPhone\n7](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)_iPhone 7_\n\nAt this point, we should add that although the OnePlus 5 has better processing\nand memory configurations on paper, it doesn’t necessarily translate to real-\nworld performance. Apple uses custom-designed chips that are built\nspecifically for a select few handsets running bespoke software, which means\nthey are highly optimised. That’s why the iPhone can compete in terms of a\nfluid user experience, even when an Android phone might look better on paper.\nSo we can’t say for sure which phone will be more powerful until we’ve given\nthe OnePlus 5 a full review.\n\nOne of the big upgrades introduced with the OnePlus 5 is a dual-camera module.\nThe rear camera has a main 16-megapixel image sensor with a wide f/1.7\naperture, paired with a telephoto 20-megapixel sensor with a f/2.6 aperture.\nThat’s compared to the iPhone 7’s solo 12-megapixel f/1.8 aperture snapper,\nwhich sounds not nearly as impressive. There is a dual-camera available on the\niPhone 7 Plus, but you’ll have to fork out more money for that luxury.\nSimilarly, the OnePlus 5’s front camera (16-megapixel, f/2.0) is a winner when\nset against the iPhone 7’s selfie shooter (12-megapixel, f/2.2).\n\nIt’s also worth noting is that the OnePlus 5 has a 3,300mAh battery, which is\nsignificantly larger than the 1,960mAh cell used in the iPhone 7. While we’d\nexpect this to mean that the OnePlus 5 would outperform the iPhone 7 in terms\nof battery life, it’s not a given due to iPhone optimisations. Still, we were\nvery underwhelmed by the iPhone 7’s battery life performance, so it would be a\nmassive disappointment if the OnePlus 5 didn’t trump its Apple rival.\n\n![cats](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)_OnePlus 5_\n\nThe only other point of interest is that the OnePlus 5 runs on Google’s\n[Android 7.0 Nougat](https://www.trustedreviews.com/android-7-0-nougat-review)\noperating system, while Apple offers the iPhone 7 with its own [iOS\n10](https://www.trustedreviews.com/ios-10-review) software. Both operating\nsystems are incredibly well-designed and will cater for most of your needs,\nalthough there are pros and cons to each of them. Check out our [Android\nNougat vs iOS 10](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/ios-10-vs-\nandroid-7-0-nougat) article for a full breakdown.\n\n**For a full spec comparison, check out the table below:**\n\n|  OnePlus 5 | Apple iPhone 7  \n---|---|---  \n**Screen** |  5.5 inches | 4.7 inches  \n**Display** |  1920 x 1080 pixels (401ppi) | 1334 x 750 pixels (326ppi)  \n**Dimensions** |  154.2 x 74.1 x 7.25mm | 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1mm  \n**Weight** |  153 grams | 138 grams  \n**Chipset** |  Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 (8-core, 2.45GHz, 10nm) | Apple A10\nFusion (4-core, 2.34GHz, 16nm)  \n**Memory** |  6GB / 8GB | 2GB  \n**Storage** |  64GB / 128GB | 32GB / 128GB / 256GB  \n**Rear Camera** |  Main: 16MP, f/1.7 | Telephoto: 20MP, f/2.6 | Main: 12MP,\nf/1.8  \n**Front Camera** |  Main: 16MP, f/2.0 | Main: 7MP, f/2.2  \n**Battery Capacity** |  3,300mAh | 1,960mAh  \n**Colours** |  Midnight Black, Slate Grey | Jet Black, Black, Silver, Gold,\nRose Gold, Red  \n**Base Price** |  £449 | £599  \n  \n## OnePlus 5 vs iPhone 7 Price: Which phone is better value?\n\nAs far as pricing goes, it seems that the OnePlus 5 wins out. That’s not a\nhuge surprise, given that OnePlus has built a business on offering phones with\ndecent specifications at attractive price points.\n\nThe OnePlus 5 starts at £449, although you can pick up the 8GB RAM/128GB\nstorage model for a heftier £499. But the most basic version of the iPhone 7\n(2GB RAM, 32GB storage) will set you back a far heftier £599 – with subsequent\nmodels costing significantly more. **  \n**\n\n![iPhone 7S\n13](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)_iPhone 7_\n\nIn terms of raw value, it’s hard to knock the OnePlus proposition. The best\nargument against OnePlus is about customer support, because the company has a\nchequered history when it comes to offering quality after-sales care. Apple,\nby comparison, has a longstanding reputation for being very customer-friendly,\nand has retail stores that are widely available across the UK if you’re in\ndire need of some tech support.\n\nBoth phones are great value in their own way, so you’ll have to decide whether\nyou’re willing to take a chance on quality customer support with OnePlus for a\nvery sizeable cash saving.\n\n## OnePlus 5 vs iPhone 7 Summary: What’s the difference?\n\nHere’s a quick breakdown of the key differences between the two phones.\n\n**Design:** The OnePlus 5 and iPhone 7 sport very similar designs, although\nthe former is a fair whack bigger than the latter. In any case, both are\nstylish, so you’ll just have to decide whether you want a 5.5-inch phone or a\nsmaller 4.7-inch model instead.\n\n![cats](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)_OnePlus 5_\n\n**Specs:** On paper, the OnePlus 5 trumps the iPhone 7 in almost every\ncategory – processing power, battery capacity, and memory configurations. But\nApple’s well-known optimisations could mean that the iPhone 7 performs better\nday-to-day.\n\n**Price:** The OnePlus 5 starts from £449, while the iPhone 7 will set you\nback at least £599. However, Apple’s famously efficient customer service could\nwoo tentative customers over to the iPhone, while budget-conscious customers\nmay be lured in by the attractive OnePlus pricing.\n\n**Related:[Best Android phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-android-\nphones-1_round-up)**\n\n**Which of these two phones do you prefer?
