After a number of incidents,\nthe phone was eventually recalled and never went on sale again in its original\nstate. Since then Samsung has released the Note 8 and is about to launch the\nGalaxy Note 9.\n\n**Related:[Samsung Galaxy Note 9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-\ngalaxy-note-9-release-date-3304594)**\n\nWe’ve removed the score from our original review, but you can get still read\nour original thoughts below if you’re so inclined.\n\n## Samsung Galaxy Note 7 – Design and Build\n\nWhile the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 might look like a minor tweaking of the design\nformula started with the Galaxy Note 5 and improved with the Galaxy S7 earlier\nin 2016, it’s actually a big signal of intent.\n\nFor the first time, Samsung has released a phone with only the option of a\ndual-curved-edge screen. This isn’t like the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge, nor the\nNote 5 and [Galaxy S6 Edge Plus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-\ngalaxy-s6-edge-plus-review). Samsung is giving you one curvaceous option and\nsaying that the curved-edge ‘experiment’ is now complete. This is the path the\nKorean company wants to take.\n\n**Related:[Best Android phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-android-\nphones-1_round-up)**  \n![s-pen 7](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nI wouldn’t be surprised if next year’s [Samsung Galaxy\nS8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s8-release-date-specs-\nrumours-price-uk) takes a similar approach and ditches the flat version, going\ncurvy all the way.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nThe Galaxy Note 7 is the pinnacle of Samsung’s design and is the culmination\nof everything the company’s learned since ditching faux-leather and plastic\ndisguised as metal.\n\nThe curved display is the headline trait, but even that’s come a long way\nsince it was first used on the ill-fated Galaxy Note Edge. It’s even been\nimproved over the one on the Galaxy S7 Edge, as the curve is less obvious and,\nwell, less curvy. It juts down at a steeper angle and takes less screen real\nestate away, but it’s just as eye-catching as ever.\n\nFollowing the curve on the front is a similar roundedness to the back, which\nwas a small design alteration introduced on the [Galaxy Note\n5](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-note-5-review). The biggest\nachievement here is just how comfortable the phone feels, considering it has a\n5.7-inch screen. It’s smaller in every dimension than both the iPhone 6S Plus\nand Huawei [Nexus 6P](https://www.trustedreviews.com/nexus-6p-review), making\nit easier to hold and use than both of those phones.\n\nThis is huge, because finally you get all the benefits of the big screen\nwithout worrying about juggling it in your hands.\n\nThe Note series has always been marketed as more of a ‘business’ device, and\nwhile this is just marketing speak that isn’t really relevant, it feeds into\nthe design. The Note 7 is more straight and boxy than the rounded [Galaxy\nS7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-s7-review) brothers, which\nare a little more fun to look at.\n\n**Related:[Best phablets to buy right\nnow](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-phablets-2015_round-up)**  \n![s-pen\n17](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIt’s still completely formed from metal and glass, and stands out as being the\nbest-looking phone you can buy right now. It’s more ergonomic than the HTC 10,\nless boring than the iPhone 6S and not as sharp as the Nexus 6P. It’s also\nwater-resistant enough to be dunked in the bath for about 30 minutes.\n\nAnother ‘first’ for the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 is Gorilla Glass 5. This glass\nnot only covers the front, but the back too, and it should protect the phone\nif you happen to drop it – which no doubt you will at some point. I’ve been\nvocal in the past about how my biggest annoyance with these flagship phones is\ntheir delicate nature.\n\n**[Buy Now: Galaxy Note 7 at Amazon.com from $903](http://amzn.to/2biJbfg)**\n\nI’ve dropped my Galaxy S7 Edge from about 2ft onto a wooden floor and it\ncaused a snaking crack down the back, while a colleague dropped one from a\nsimilar height onto concrete and destroyed the whole front.\n\nThankfully, and I’m sure the Samsung PR folk will be happy to hear this, I\nhaven’t dropped the Note 7. Yet. So I can’t really say if Gorilla Glass 5 is a\nwhole heap better than 4, but I’ll definitely update this review once I’ve\nused it for a few months (and probably dropped it).\n\n![note](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Samsung Galaxy Note 7 – Display\n\nIts size was once the story with the Note series. Its size set it apart. It\nwas huge, unmanageable, basically a tablet. How big was the display on the\noriginal Note? It was 5.3 inches. That’s now considered small.\n\nAnd while the Note’s display has grown to 5.7 inches, it’s no longer the\ndifferentiator. Other phones, such as the Nexus 6P, are the same size, and\nwhile the iPhone 6S Plus has a smaller display, it has a bigger footprint.\n\nBut even though it may not stand out for its size, the Note 7 does so because\nof its quality – something arguably much more important.\n\nLike all of Samsung’s flagships, and even some of its cheaper phones like the\n[Galaxy J3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-j3-review), the\nstarting point is the Super AMOLED panel. It might not have the viewing angles\nyou get with an IPS LCD, but the oomph and joyous colours more than make up\nfor that. Samsung’s honed this display technology over time and it’s now the\nbest it’s ever been.\n\n(uswitch type=table brand=Samsung model=Galaxy_Note_7 limit=1)\n\nColours are strong and vibrant, blacks are dark and there’s no muddiness in\nthe whites. It’s a joy to look at, and its brightness means it’s perfectly\nviewable even in direct sunlight. This is the brightest phone screen I’ve ever\nused, and it’s mightily impressive. There are some minor reflections if you\nlook very closely near the edge of the display, but it doesn’t affect use.\n\n**Related:[Note 7 vs Nexus 6P](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-\ngalaxy-note-7-vs-google-nexus)**  \n![s-pen 5](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nInstead of upping the resolution to 4K – something that was heavily rumoured –\nSamsung has kept it at quad-HD. With a pixel density of 518ppi, individual\npixels are impossible to spot, even if you get really close.\n\nWhile it hasn’t added 4K, it has added HDR (high dynamic range). Well, Samsung\ncalls it ‘Mobile HDR’, but it works in a similar way to how it functions on an\nHDR-compatible television. It’s a display tech that improves contrast while\nretaining extra detail in the brightest and darkest areas of the picture. Many\nin the _TrustedReviews_ office will tell you that HDR is more important than\n4K. It’s a big deal.\n\nMost HDR content comes from a service, such as Amazon Video or Netflix, piped\nthrough a dedicated box or supported television. The new [Xbox One\nS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/xbox-one-s-vs-xbox-one), for\nexample, can play both HDR content and games if you’ve got the right\ntelevision to display them\n\nIt works a bit differently on the Note 7, though. Along with streaming actual\nHDR content, there’s a mode that bursts into life when a supported app is\nopened. Start up Netflix, YouTube, Amazon Prime or the dedicated video app and\na ‘Video enhancer mode’ will kick in. This simulates the idea of HDR, boosting\nthe brightness and fiddling about with the contrast settings.\n\nIt does make a very visible difference, but at times It can be a little\njarring. The move from a typical phone screen to one that feels like it’s\ntrying to sear your retinas is odd, but the results are great.\n\nI do feel this would work better on a tablet, as that’s meant to be used for\nmedia, whereas I rarely sit back and watch anything other than YouTube on my\nphone. Still, it’s typical of the Note series to deliver something we haven’t\nseen before, perhaps as some sort of trial. I wouldn’t be surprised if we see\nthis tech trickle down to the Galaxy S8, and hopefully the Samsung Galaxy\nTabPro S2.\n\n**Related:[What is HDR?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/hdr-tv-high-\ndynamic-television-explained)**  \n![note7\n13](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nJust like the Galaxy S7, the Note 7 has an ‘Always-on display’. Even when the\nphone is locked, a clock and a row of notification icons glow on the screen.\nThe bonus with AMOLED tech is that it only needs to light up individual\npixels, so there’s not a huge drain on battery from this feature. My biggest\nissue with the original way the AOD worked has been resolved, as it’ll now\ndisplay icons from every app rather than just Samsung’s own.\n\nIt’s a nice, if unessential, feature that can be both annoying and useful. But\nat least you can turn it off.\n\n[ Next  \nPerformance, S Pen and Software\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-7-performance-s-\npen-and-software-page-2)\n\n"}
