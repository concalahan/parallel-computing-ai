Our guide reveals\nall you need to know about ‘WanaCrypt0r 2.0’, the ransomware software behind\nthe breach, as well as featuring all the latest news.**\n\n## WannaCry Ransomware: Latest news\n\nIn a fresh development first reported on Thursday August 3, it now seems that\nall bitcoin wallets related to the WannaCry hack have been emptied.\n\nThe total sum believe to be involved in the withdrawal is over £100,000\n(~$137,000) and was originally paid by victims of the attack to the hackers\ninvolved.\n\n_Quartz_ journalist Keith Collins shared the news on social media, having\ndiscovered the bitcoin exodus via a Twitter bot he set up to monitor wallets\nrelated to the WannaCry ransomware.\n\n> Bot scoop: The owners of the three bitcoin wallets tied to the\n[#WannaCry](https://twitter.com/hashtag/WannaCry?src=hash) ransomware attack\nhave just started withdrawing money <https://t.co/10buEtsUfW>\n\n>\n\n> — Keith Collins (@collinskeith) [August 3,\n2017](https://twitter.com/collinskeith/status/892946969152434176)\n\nVictims of the WannaCry attack, which took place in May and affected a number\nof global businesses as well as the NHS, were told to pay up to $600 (~£455)\nto regain access to their computers.\n\nIt’s understood that WannaCry ransom-related funds first started to vanish\nfrom wallets in late-July, but the withdrawal noted by Collins marks the\nhackers’ boldest move since executing the attack.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nRead 0n for a complete guide to ransomware and the WannaCry hack that affected\nthe NHS earlier this year.\n\n**Related:[Is my password safe?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/password-\nstrength-check-list-guide-safe-hack-2950096)**\n\n## What is ransomware?\n\nThe first thing you need to know about WanaCrypt0r 2.0 (also known as\nWannaCry, Wcry, or Wanna Decryptor) is that it’s a type of malicious software\ncalled ransomware.\n\nThe name comes from the term ‘ransom’, which means to demand payment for a\nthird party’s belongings that you’ve seized.\n\nOnce ransomware ends up on your computer system, it will encrypt your data so\nyou can no longer access it. The software will then demand money in exchange\nfor decrypting your software.\n\nRansomware software generally only demands a few hundred pounds or dollars.\nThat’s because if the amount was too high, people would be unwilling to pay.\nInstead, hackers make their money from bulk payments, rather than individual\nwins.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that payment is often requested in Bitcoin, a virtual\ncurrency that’s much harder to trace than more conventional transactions.\n\n## What is WannaCry (aka Wcry or Wanna Decryptor)?\n\nWannaCry is just one example of ransomware, and can be bought online in secret\nblack market forums.\n\nThe software has gained notoriety recently on account of it making its way\ninto the systems of both Telefónica in Spain and the NHS in the UK.\n\nIt’s important to point out, however, that the NHS wasn’t necessarily\nspecifically targeted. Hackers tend to create scripts that will try and push\nransomware onto as many machines as possible, and the NHS was almost certainly\njust an unfortunate victim.\n\nThe NHS attack actually started in Lancashire, and then spread throughout\nsystems at various NHS Trusts.\n\nPart of the reason why the NHS is particularly vulnerable is that many NHS\nTrusts use outdated version of Windows, as far back as Windows XP. Without\nrecent security patches, it’s impossible for a system to stay truly safe from\nhackers.\n\n## How to stay safe from ransomware\n\nOnce ransomware gets onto your system, there’s very little you can do. So our\nbest advice is simply to try to stay safe from it in the first place.\n\nThe most powerful protection you have from ransomware is backing up your\nsystems. That way, even if your machine does become encrypted by ransomware,\nyou can restore the system using a backup that’s stored somewhere else.\n\nDon’t forget that ransomware often targets users through phishing, too.\n\nPhishing is a type of online scam that involves tricking users into handing\nover information or downloading malicious files. An example of a phishing scam\nwould be an e-mail that’s made to look like it’s from your bank, but any\ninformation you enter into a linked web-page in the email actually gets sent\nto hackers.\n\nIn WannaCry’s case, the malicious file would have been downloaded through a\nseemingly normal e-mail. That’s why it’s important to always be wary of links\nyou click and attachments you open in e-mails. If the sender doesn’t appear\ntrusted, don’t open or click anything.\n\n## Should you ever pay a ransomware ransom?\n\nWith ransoms of all kinds, the general advice is to not pay the ransom. By\npaying the ransom, you’re promoting the use of ransomware as an effective\nmeans of extorting money.\n\nThat said, some people often pay the cash just to retrieve important files.\nNote, however, that not all ransomware will decrypt your files; some will\nsimply take the money and leave you stuck.\n\nAgain, the best advice is to ensure you have all of your files backed up. By\ndoing so, there’s no risk from ransomware as you’ll always be able to restore\nyour data.\n\nThere are some legitimate programs that can attempt to decrypt your systems\ntoo, but these won’t always work – especially if the encryption method is very\ncomplex.\n\n**Related:[Best laptops](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-laptops_round-\nup)**\n\nIt’s also worth letting the authorities know you’ve been hacked. Ransomware\nscams are often massive global operations, so it’s important for the police\nand security services to have a good idea of how a scam is operating in order\nto better trace e-mails and money to the culprits.\n\n"}
