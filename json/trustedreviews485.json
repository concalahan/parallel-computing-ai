Just\nlike many of Apple’s recent new product categories, the first Apple Watch\nlacked refinement in certain areas but with its sophomore release, Apple\nimproved many aspects of the watchOS operating system as well as bolstering\nthe Apple Watch 2’s appeal with a GPS sensor and water-resistance, making it a\ngreat choice for fitness enthusiasts.\n\nBut was the move to the Apple Watch 3 as big a leap? Let’s find out.\n\n**Related:[Apple GymKit](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-gym-kit-uk-\ntreadmill-spin-apple-watch-3352836)**\n\n## Apple Watch 3 vs Apple Watch 2 – Design and display\n\nApple is one of a few companies still producing smartwatches with a non-\ncircular display these days, with other manufacturers looking to ape more\ntraditional timepiece designs. Unsurprisingly, Apple has stuck with a squared-\noff design, which is probably a relief to all of the watchOS developers out\nthere.\n\n### Best Currys Apple Watch Series 3

The Apple Watch 2\nlaunched with a 38mm option with 272 x 340 resolution and a 42mm option with\n312 x 390 resolution, which remains for the Apple Watch 3. Both models feature\na 1000nits display, which means it is super bright and easy to read even under\nbright outdoor lighting.\n\nThe rotating crown once again makes a return, which has always been a great\nway to get round the problem of your finger obstructing the small display when\ninteracting with the touchscreen. To more easily identify the new Apple Watch\n3, the rotating crown is now a distinctive red if you opt for the more\nexpensive cellular-enabled model (more on this below).\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nApple is introducing a range of new straps for the Apple Watch 3, but these\nwill also work with the older model. There’s also new premium Ceramic Grey\noption for the Apple Watch 3, which won’t be available for the Apple Watch 2.\n\nBoth models are still water-resistant to 50m, so great for swimmers or just\nanyone who doesn’t want to take their Apple Watch off to shower.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Apple Watch 3 vs Apple Watch 2 – Sensors and specifications\n\nThe Apple Watch 2 saw the debut of Apple’s new S2 dual-core wearable chipset,\nwhich brought with it improved performance as well as battery efficiency. The\nApple Watch 3 improves on this further, a new S3 processor promises a further\n70% performance increase over the S2. A new W2 chipset is dedicated to\nwireless connectivity, which promises 50% power efficiency improvements over\nthe Series 2 and 85% performance improvements for Wi-Fi in particular.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe big addition, however, is the inclusion of a LTE cellular antenna, which\nis cleverly built into the screen. Often, smartwatches incorporate these into\nthe strap section that connects to the watch casing, making them slightly\nstiff and uncomfortable. The cellular connection means you’ll have always-on\ndata and cellular access for calls and notifications, without the need for Wi-\nFi or a Bluetooth connection to your iPhone.\n\nThe Apple Watch 3 will use an e-SIM, which cuts down on the size and also\nmeans your Apple Watch 3 will use the same phone number as your iPhone. One of\nthe chief complaints about many LTE-enabled smartwatches today has been\nneeding to have a separate phone number and contract for your wearable.\n\n**Related:[Best Apple Watch apps](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\napple-watch-apps)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nInside the Apple Watch 2 and Apple 3 you can also find an accelerometer, a GPS\nsensor and a heart rate monitor round back. NFC is also onboard both with\nsupport for Apple Pay and GymKit.\n\n[Apple GymKit](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-gym-kit-uk-treadmill-\nspin-apple-watch-3352836) is a new integration that has recently rolled out in\nwatchOS 4.1 onwards. This lets your Apple Watch communicate with compatible\nfitness equipment, such as treadmills and ellipticals, to exchange data\nbetween the two devices. This works in both directions, so whichever device\nhas the most accurate or relevant information will share it with the other.\nSo, for example, the treadmill can share its distance information with the\nApple Watch, so all those miles are logged correctly in the Workout app.\n\n[flaming id=”117″]\n\nThe Apple Watch in turn can share its heart rate data with the treadmill,\nalongside user details such as height, age and weight, so you don’t have to\nmanually enter these on the treadmill. Simply tap your Apple Watch against the\nsensor and get going. It’s a really great way of logging all of that extra\nworkout detail you might miss out on otherwise. Expect GymKit compatibility to\nroll out to more gyms over the next few months as Apple has worked with most\nof the big equipment makers.\n\nThe other big addition for the Apple Watch Series 3 is a barometric altimeter,\nwhich means it tracks elevation data. This is great for any outdoor activities\nsuch as cycling, skiing or running as it’ll track all of those difficult hill\nclimbs or killer slopes. It’s also a great way to correlate the heart rate\nsensor against the actual effort and intensity of your exercise. While the\ngraph might show your heart rate spike at a certain point, the elevation data\nmight show you exactly why. Getting up those hills is seriously taxing, after\nall.\n\nEven indoors, the barometric altimeter will be able to monitor the stairs you\nclimb, which is a great motivator to opt for the stairs instead of the\nelevator. The Apple Watch 2 has to piggyback the altimeter in your iPhone, so\nyou’ll truly be able to leave your phone behind with the Apple Watch 3.\n\n**Related:[What is HIIT?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/hiit-\nworkouts-2951271)**\n\nBoth models of the Apple Watch will run the new [watchOS\n4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-watchos-4-new-features-release-\ndate-download-2950900) operating system, which brings with it a number of\nimprovements. such as support for HIIT training, a new Heart Rate app and a\nproactive Siri watchface that delivers live information straight to your\ndisplay.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Apple Watch 3 vs Apple Watch 2 – Battery life\n\nThe Apple Watch 2 saw impressive improvements to its battery life compared to\nits predecessor. It’s not uncommon to see more than 2 days from a single\ncharge but Apple officially rates it at 18 hours. Apple has said this remains\nfor the Apple Watch 3, regardless of if you opt for the cellular or non-\ncellular version.\n\n**Buy Now:[Fossil Q Marshal Brown Leather Strap Smart Watch for just £139.99 –\nlowest price ever](http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8209862/type/dlg/sid/tr-\nblackfriday/http://www.argos.co.uk/product/6181174)**\n\n**Related:[Best smartwatches](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nsmartwatch)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Apple Watch 3 vs Apple Watch 2 – Which is better value for money?\n\nApple has revealed the Apple Watch 3 will start at £329/$329 for the non-\ncellular model, rising to £399/$399 for the LTE-enabled model. That’s a decent\ndiscount from the non-cellular model if you don’t need the faster performance\nand altimeter and is cheaper than the entry-level Apple Watch 2’s launch\nprice. If you want cellular connectivity, you only really have one choice and\nthat’s to go for the top-of-the-range model. Expect the Apple Watch 2 to have\na price reduction as retailers clear stock as it’s being discontinued. In the\nUK, for example, Nike is selling the Apple Watch 2 Nike+ for around £260.\n\n**Related:[Best fitness trackers](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nfitness-tracker)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Apple Watch 3 vs Apple Watch 2 summary – What’s the difference?\n\nFor a quick breakdown of the key differences between the two smartwatches,\nhere’s what you need to know.\n\n**Design:** The design is almost identical, with only a tiny, fractional\nchange in size. That’s impressive considering the Apple Watch 3 has a new LTE\nantenna and altimeter crammed inside. The Apple Watch 3 can be easily\nidentified by its red digital crown.\n\n**Specs:** The Apple Watch 3 promises 70% faster performance and 85% better\nWi-Fi performance and 50% better wireless energy efficiency. It also includes\nan LTE cellular connection for the first time and an altimeter for elevation\ndata during outdoor activities.\n\n**Battery life:** Battery life is said to be the same between both models.\n\n**Price:** The Apple Watch 3 will cost $329/£329 for non-cellular and\n$399/£399 for the LTE model. Expect the price of the Apple Watch 2 to fall\nbelow £300 as retailers clear stock.\n\n**What do you think of the new Apple Watch 3? Let us know on Twitter or\nFacebook.**\n\n"}
