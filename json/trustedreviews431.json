Id Software is back in action with Doom Eternal, which takes the\nmodernized rendition of the first-person shooter classic and revs it up to an\nincredible degree—from more grotesque demons to demolish to even more\ndeliciously violent takedowns and plenty more.\n\n_Trusted Reviews_ has compiled everything you need to know about DOOM Eternal\nafter the closer look we got at Quakecon, including all the latest news,\nrelease date, gameplay trailers and more!\n\n**Related:**[ **Best PS4\nGames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/ps4-games-3431751)\n\n![DOOM\nEternal](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## DOOM Eternal – what is it?\n\nDoom Eternal is the fifth main game in the legendary shooter series, but more\nnotably, it’s the follow-up to the aforementioned modern revival. It takes\nthat impressively well-honed approach, with its speedy and satisfyingly swift\naction, and seemingly amplifies it to a whole new level as the Doom Slayer\nhunts his ample prey through fiery, demon-infested locations on Earth.\n\nThe Doom Slayer was already suitably badass the last time around, but now he\nhas some new tools and abilities to help make even quicker work of his prey.\nFor example, he has a blade attached to his left arm that can be used to slash\nfoes in half and rip out their organs (and stuff them into different openings,\nno less). He also has a grappling hook that uses enemies as an anchor, letting\nyou swing from point to point by finding a new foe to penetrate. Along with\nsome well-placed poles to swing off of, it adds more verticality to the\nexperience.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nEternal also brings back some classic enemies from the pixel-packed originals,\nall reimagined for the modern era, and they’re gradually destructible: each\nwill visibly deteriorate as you blast, pummel, and detonate them. And there\nare fresh weapons, as well, including some sort of phenomenal rune-engraved\nlaser sword that appears at the tail end of the QuakeCon demo. There’s also a\n“Super Shotgun Meat Hook mod,” which we can’t wait to see in action.\n\nThe campaign action is mostly set across fiery hellscapes, but the QuakeCon\ndemo also showed off some fabulous-looking new terrain, such as intricately-\ndesigned fantasy castle locales. The new idTech 7 engine allows for vastly\nmore detail and geometry than before, which makes for vaster and more involved\nenvironments.\n\nIt’s a direct sequel to the 2016 reboot, something that is immediately obvious\nfrom the DOOM Marine himself and the denizens of demons hungry for bullets in\nthe debut trailer. Mick Gordon has also returned to compose the soundtrack,\nensuring we’ll have plenty of metal brilliance to rock out to while\nvanquishing evil.\n\n**Related:**[ **Upcoming Xbox One\nGames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/upcoming-xbox-one-\ngames-2018-3531040)\n\n![DOOM\nEternal](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## DOOM Eternal release date – when is it coming out?\n\nAt the time or writing, Bethesda has confirmed that DOOM: Eternal is planned\nfor a 2019 release.\n\nCurrently, launch is planned for\n[PS4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/playstation-4), [Xbox\nOne](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/xbox-one-s) and\n[PC](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/best-gaming-pc-2993099) in addition\nto the [Nintendo Switch](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nintendo-\nswitch), with that port being handled by Panic Button, the company responsible\nfor the Switch ports of both [Wolfenstein\nII](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/wolfenstein-2-nintendo-switch) and\nthe rebooted [Doom](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/doom).\n\n## DOOM Eternal Trailer – how does it look?\n\nWant to see 25 minutes of Doom Eternal gameplay, fresh from Quakecon? We’ve\ngot you covered.\n\nWant to see the the official E3 teaser? Right this way!\n\n## DOOM Eternal Gameplay – How does it play?\n\nNo in-game footage has been shown thus far for DOOM: Eternal, with a more\nsubstantial debut to take place at QuakeCon in August. Considering the\nrelatively small gap between Eternal and its predecessor, we imagine many of\nthe same elements will return with a bunch of welcome refinements.\n\nWe expect the return of fast, frantic gunplay alongside glory kills and\nclassic weapons ripe for experimentation. Time will tell whether the\nmultiplayer mode will return, which received a lukewarm reception compared to\nthe beloved campaign. One thing we’d love to see is the arcade mode\nimplemented as a post-launched update available right away in DOOM: Eternal.\n\n## **Doom Eternal multiplayer: What are invaders?**\n\nHere’s an interesting new twist for Doom Eternal: online players will now have\nthe ability to take the role of demons and “invade” another player’s campaign.\nIt’s a strictly optional feature, in case you prefer to slay solo, but that\nshould add a fun new wrinkle to the Doom experience. It will also finally\nprovide an opportunity to experience the game from the other side of the\nshotgun in a campaign scenario.\n\nDoom Eternal will also offer a more traditional take on competitive\nmultiplayer, although it’s not yet clear what that will look like. The last\nDoom’s multiplayer, developed with external partner Certain Affinity, was\nwidely seen as weak compared to the strong solo campaign.\n\nHowever, id Software [tells\nPolygon](https://www.polygon.com/2018/8/10/17675824/doom-eternal-competitive-\nmultiplayer-details-pvp-quakecon-2018) that Doom Eternal will feature\nsomething entirely new, and that they’re developing the multiplayer component\nthemselves. “It’s very Doom,” said creative director Hugo Martin. “It’s very\ngood.”\n\nWe’ll surely find out more about the multiplayer experience and other elements\nof the game as Doom Eternal’s expected 2019 release nears.\n\n**Are you ready to slay demons in DOOM: Eternal?
