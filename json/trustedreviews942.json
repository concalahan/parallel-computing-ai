So\nit’s fair to say we’re seriously excited about what its long awaited\nsuccessor, the newly announced Sony ZF9, might be able to achieve. Set to\nlaunch in the autumn, here’s our guide to where the ZF9 differ from – and\nhopefully improve upon – its illustrious predecessor. **\n\n![Sony\nZF9/Z9F](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSony ZF9/Z9F\n\n## Sony ZF9 vs Sony ZD9 – Viewing angles\n\nOn the design front, aside from carrying a slightly differently styled rear\npanel, the only major difference is the way the Sony ZF9 sits on a pair of\nsharply angled feet, while the [Sony\nZD9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sony-kd65zd9) sits on a centrally\nmounted metal plate.\n\nTo me the Sony ZF9 feet look slightly comical versus the elegance of the ZD9\nplate stand. But at least they carry channelling to help you hide your cables.\nNote that the ZF9s are only currently set to appear in 65-inch and 75-inch\nversions; there’s no word yet on a possible 100-inch ZF9 to replace the\n100-inch ZD9.\n\nDuring our study of the ZF9’s appearance, we also couldn’t fail to notice a\npretty stunning new picture feature that gives it a major edge over not just\nthe ZD9, but all LCD TVs released to date. Thanks to a new X-Wide Angle\nfeature, you can watch the ZF9 from pretty much any angle without the picture\nlosing either colour saturation or contrast.\n\n**Related:[Sony’s new Master Series 4K TVs could be the ultimate way to watch\nNetflix](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/sony-master-series-4k-tv-\nnetflix-3520948)**\n\n![Sony\nZF9](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSony 75ZF9 on the left, 75X940E on the right\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nIn fact, demonstrations suggested that the ZF9s are at least as good as any\nOLED TV when it comes to viewing angles. This is a massively important step\nforward for any household where one or more viewers routinely has to watch TV\nfrom an angle.\n\nSony wouldn’t be drawn on exactly how it has (exclusively) achieved this\ngroundbreaking viewing angle feat, other than to say it was an ‘optical’\nfeature built into the panel structure.\n\nThe ZF9 mercifully sees Sony replacing the buggy Android TV interface found on\nits current TVs with a new Android Oreo implementation. This looks set to be\nfar cleaner, more intuitive and less dictatorial than its predecessor. Though\nit’s perhaps a touch worrying that we only got the briefest of glimpses of\nOreo in action, seemingly because it’s still not considered to be quite ready\nfor sharing outside Sony’s labs.\n\n**Related:[Best TV](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-tv-3440232)**\n\n## Sony ZF9 vs Sony ZD9 – Dimming zones\n\nSony is notoriously unwilling to share TV specifications such as local dimming\nzone counts or maximum brightness outputs. What we do know is that the ZF9\nfollows the ZD9 in using a direct lighting system (where the LEDs sit directly\nbehind the screen) in conjunction with a local dimming system that can control\nhundreds of separate zones.\n\nOur feeling from what Sony said at its introduction to the ZF9 is that it\ndoesn’t support more local dimming zones than the ZD9. And may even support\nless. What is certain is that the processing being used to drive the dimming\nalgorithms is far more powerful on the Sony ZF9 – and experience has shown\nbefore that this can actually be much more important than simply having the\nmost dimming zones.\n\n![Sony\nZF9/Z9F](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSony ZF9/Z9F\n\n## Sony ZF9 vs Sony ZD9 – Processing\n\nPart of the reason the Sony ZF9 can offer improved dimming processing is that\nit uses Sony’s new X1 Ultimate video processor. The ZD9, by comparison, uses\nthe X1 Extreme processor. Ultimate is claimed by Sony to be around twice as\npowerful, and as such should be able to deliver better image processing\nresults on the fly than even the impressive X1 Extreme engine could.\n\nSony didn’t provide a useful demonstration for comparing the effects of X1\nUltimate against X1 Extreme. But having seen X1 Ultimate running on an LCD TV\nat the CES in January, we expect better sharpness with both upscaled HD and\nnative 4K sources; better noise reduction; better colour management,\nespecially in peak brightness areas; smoother colour gradations; and enhanced\nshadow detailing.\n\nThe Sony ZF9’s motion handling should comfortably outgun that of the ZD9, too,\nthanks to the new set’s X-Motion Clarity system. This leverages the direct\nlighting/local dimming capabilities of the ZF9 to manipulate the backlight\nonly in areas where there’s movement to deal with.\n\n![Sony\nZF9/Z9F](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSony ZF9/Z9F\n\nThe result is the sort of natural look to motion associated with black frame\ninsertion techniques, only without the overall picture dimness BFI usually\ncauses.\n\nX-Motion Clarity already worked fantastically well on Sony’s XF9005 LCD TVs,\nbut it should be even more effective on the Sony ZF9 due to its extra dimming\nzones and processing power.\n\nThe Sony ZF9’s pictures are also likely going to see a shift in emphasis in\nsome areas. That’s due to Sony’s new focus on trying to match its new Master\nSeries TVs’ pictures as closely as possible to those of the legendary Sony\nBVM-X300 OLED mastering monitor.\n\nCertainly it seemed at the ZF9 launch event as if Sony may be reducing peak\nbrightness a little versus the ZD9, maybe to match colours more to the look of\nthe OLED monitor. Plus it felt as if Sony might be sacrificing some black\nlevel depth on the ZF9 in return for getting shadow detailing to look closer\nto that of the X300.\n\nWe’ll need to get a review sample before we’re able to confirm these initial\npicture impressions, though.\n\n![Sony\nZF9/Z9F](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSony ZF9/Z9F\n\n## Sony ZF9 vs Sony ZD9 – Features\n\nTrying to match the Sony ZF9’s pictures to those from an X300 mastering\nmonitor is not the only new feature aimed at delivering pictures ‘as their\ncreators intended them to look’. Particularly eye-catching is a new Netflix\nCalibrated Mode. Activate this while watching Netflix on the ZF9’s built-in\napp, and the TV’s picture settings will change to deliver images with values –\nincluding refresh rates – that track those Netflix used when it was creating\nits content.\n\nAlongside the new [Sony AF9 OLED](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/sony-\naf9-vs-sony-af8-3523175) TVs, the ZF9s are also Sony’s first TVs to carry full\ncolour management for end-user calibration. There’s even a new app developed\nin conjunction with calibration specialists SpectraCal which lets you run an\nautomatic calibration if you have the right measuring gear.\n\nThere’s no information yet on how the ZF9 pricing might compare with that of\nthe ZD9, or if there are any significant sound quality differences.\n\nOverall, while the Sony ZF9 might not have evolved from the ZD9 in all the\ndirections we’d perhaps expected, there’s more than enough new stuff going on\nto already make it look like a genuine LCD game changer. Look out for a review\nin the next two to three months.\n\n"}
