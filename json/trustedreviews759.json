Sky holds the rights to\nbroadcast 128 matches, while BT has 52.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Amazon has dipped its toe in broadcasting live sport\nafter having bagged the rights to stream the US Open and ATP World Tour tennis\ntournaments, as well as select NFL matches.\n\n**Related:[Amazon Fire TV\nStick](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/amazon-fire-stick)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nHowever, this is its first major foray into football, especially a major\nBritish league.\n\nThe matches will be available to anyone with an Amazon Prime subscription,\nwhich means you shouldn’t have to shell out any extra cash to get your Premier\nLeague fix.\n\nThat said, it’s not quite as good of a deal as the recent Champion’s League\nfinal, which was streamed for free through BT’s YouTube channel.\n\n**Has the prospect of 20 Premier League matches got you tempted to pick up an\nAmazon Prime subscription?
