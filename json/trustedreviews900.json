However, it’s somewhat derivative\nof the more portable 12-inch MacBook, it has a keyboard loads of people hate,\nand bumps the price of the cheapest MacBook by £250 – likely pricing many\npeople out of a MacBook purchase.\n\nHowever, one area unlikely to cause much debate is the performance. The\ncompany has added 8th-gen Intel Core ‘i’ processors, which deliver big time\ncompared to comparable models in Apple’s recent MacBook range.\n\nNewly published Geekbench scores from\n[9to5Mac](https://9to5mac.com/2018/11/01/macbook-air-geekbench-results/) show\nthe 1.6GHz dual-core i5 MacBook Air 2018 notched up ~4200 in single-core\ntesting and ~7800 in multi-core testing.\n\nCompared to the 2017 MacBook Air, that’s a boost of 27% and 28% faster in\nsingle- and multi-core scores. Meanwhile, its 20% (single-core) and 17%\n(multi-core) faster than the 12-inch Retina Macbook, despite being £50/$100\ncheaper.\n\nOf course, the laptop is blown out of the water bay the 2018 13-inch MacBook\nPro according to the report, which scored 16,464 in multi-core testing.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n**Related:[iPad Pro 2018 vs iPad Pro\n2017](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ipad-pro-2018-vs-ipad-\npro-2017-3612809)**\n\nJust yesterday we brought similar word of performance scores for the [new iPad\nPro versus Apple’s 15-inch MacBook\nPro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/macbook-pro-vs-ipad-\npro-2018-benchmarks-3614190) laptops. Turns out the new A12X processor sitting\ninside Apple’s most powerful tablet ever is far more competitive with the\nlaptop than anyone probably envisioned.\n\nOf course there are more things to consider here than just the performance of\nthe processor in benchmarking tests. The MacBook Pro has way more RAM, a\nlarger display and an attached physical keyboard. While no direct comparison\nhas taken place yet, we can safely assume the MacBook Pro enjoys superior\ngraphical performance. But still…\n\n**Are you planning a MacBook Air purchase?
