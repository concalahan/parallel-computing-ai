It\nlooks forward not just by catering for those with new hardware. This is an\nupdate with certain improvements you’ll only notice if you have an older\nphone, since the device will run faster than with iOS 11.\n\nUse an iPhone, or iPad, released in the past couple of years, and you’ll find\niOS 12 an update whose features are gradually discovered. There have been\ntweaks to the way it handles notifications, the way that Face ID works, and to\nfeatures such as battery monitoring and Siri.\n\nHowever, the best way to get a handle on iOS 12, to ensure you’re not missing\nthe best bits, is to take a more active approach. Let’s compare it to iOS 11\nto see what’s really new in Apple’s latest software.\n\n**Related:**[ **How to download iOS 12 right\nnow**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/how-to/ios-12-beta-download-3481261)\n\n## iOS 12 Release Date: When will it be available?\n\nApple announced iOS 12 back at WWDC in June.

iOS 12 Features: What’s new?\n\n## Memojis vs Animojis\n\nMemojis are the most fun part of iOS 12 to play around with in the first 10\nminutes. However, you can only use them if you have an [iPhone\nXS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-xs-release-date-specs-price-\nuk-3551351), XR, X or [XS Max](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-\nxs-max). This is because they use the front camera hardware to work, from\nwhich only newer phones benefit.\n\nMemojis are Animojis you can design to look like yourself. Or, perhaps, a\nfriend.\n\nTo try out feature, go to the Messages app, tap the New Message button and\nthen the monkey Animoji icon. Swipe left-to-right on the bar that pops up and\npress the + icon. This lets you cycle through presets for each part of the\nface to make one that looks like you.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n_Throwing Memoji shade_\n\nWe could argue that with all the augmented reality stuff plugged into the\nlatest iPhones and iOS, it should be able to make auto suggestions so you\ndon’t have to spend time fine-tuning each piece. However, that’s really all\npart of the fun of Memojis.\n\nThe results appear like an Apple take on Nintendo’s Mii characters. They’re\ncutesy and have plenty of character, but the lack of scope in the options for\ndifferent weights and ages seems purpose-built to avoid offence. You can’t\nreally make a bad-looking Memoji.\n\nOpting for facial hair on a Memoji with a traditionally feminine haircut is\nabout as transgressive as you can get. Well, other than making its skin\npurple.\n\nMemojis do work about as well as standard Animojis, so are great fun to play\naround with, particularly in a family setting.\n\n## ARKit 2.0\n\niOS 12’s augmented reality improvements are perhaps the most technically\ninteresting changes to the software. We now get [ARKit\n2.0](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/what-is-apple-arkit-3286676), even\nthough many of you may not have tried ARKit yet. It’s Apple’s AR platform,\ndefining what app developers can, and can’t, do.\n\nARKit 2.0 introduces multi-player AR, with numerous phones and tablets sharing\nthe same game environment. It also adds 3D object tracking, and lets AR\nsessions resume, rather than effectively creating a new AR environment each\ntime you play.\n\nAll of this will mature in the hands of developers. However, iOS 12 adds the\nMeasure app as a demo, too, which comes as part of the software.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIt lets you measure objects in three dimensions, acting like a virtual tape\nmeasure. You’re not limited to a single plane, either. I tried the box of a\n£79 MagSafe 2 60W MacBook Pro adapter, bought after the original frayed into a\nfire hazard. Sure enough, you can measure its sides and distances along a\ntablet surface in the same scene.\n\nIt isn’t perfect, and the iPhone XS tends to confuse the scene unless it’s a\ndecent distance from the object in order to gain perspective. But it’s worth\nchecking out.\n\nARKit offers a fresh toy box for developers. It will no doubt appear gimmicky\nin the wrong hands, but it’s good to see Apple keep up the pace on AR\ndevelopment, even if it hasn’t caught on with normal users yet.\n\n## iOS 12: Screen Time\n\nIf Memoji is the feature you might play with in the first five minutes of\nusing iOS 12, Screen Time is the one you’ll dabble with for the first week.\nIt’s part of Apple’s digital wellness additions to its mobile software,\nmirroring those coming to [Android\nP](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/android-pie).\n\nApple’s strategy seems to be to make these new features both easy to access\nand easy to ignore. They do not, unlike ARKit 2.0, have their own show-off\napp. Instead, they’re part of the Settings menu. You have to manually switch\nScreen Time on, too.\n\nOn its face, Screen Time looks similar to a battery consumption screen. You\nsee a breakdown of how you spend time on your phone.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nFor many of us, the likely revelation is that we spend too much time on social\nmedia or YouTube. And that’s the point.\n\nDig deeper into its menus and you can see your behaviours over time, how many\nphone “pickups” you do each day, and how your use breaks down over a week\ninstead of a day.\n\nThis is moderately interesting on its own, but it becomes more useful when you\nadd the active controls. You can limit the amount of time spent in certain\ntypes of apps, with App Limits.\n\nThese reset every day, and at present when you go beyond that time, it’s\npossible to “ignore” the limit if you like. However, it’s useful if you don’t\nwant to splurge your time away on apps as much anymore.\n\nBehaviour such as this could well turn into the next “gluten-free” or “part-\ntime vegan” lifestyle fad. Although if you give up on social media, you have\nfewer sources of validation for such a move.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCynical as this sounds, I do see the benefit. I’m currently spending a lot of\ntime on Gumtree, eBay and Facebook Marketplace looking for a car. Too much,\nperhaps. And while I haven’t mustered the willpower to actually stick to a\npreset time allowance, I may do so once I’ve found a car. Just like an addict:\nalways an excuse.\n\nThere are some major shortcomings to this side of Screen Time, though. You set\ntimes by category – social networking, productivity, entertainment and others\n– rather than per app.\n\nThis is a problem. I may spend a decent amount of time in WhatsApp, but I\ndon’t consider it wasted as I’m directly talking to close friends and family.\nHowever, Screen Time lumps it in with Facebook and other social networks. You\ncan’t yet set single-app restrictions. For many of us, this would be the most\nuseful mechanic.\n\nAs such, the best outcome might be for parents to use Screen Time and App\nLimits to control how their kids use their old hand-me-down iPhones. Screen\nTime allows sharing across a family’s iOS devices, so parents can keep an eye\non kids. App use limits can also be protected, with a password required to\noverride them.\n\n## iOS 12 Performance\n\nOne of the most important claims for iOS 12 is improved performance. However,\nperhaps unsurprisingly, moving from an iPhone X running iOS 11 to an iPhone XS\nrunning iOS 12, there’s no grand difference in speed. Both are fluid and fast.\n\niOS 12’s optimisations are of much more interest to owners of older iPhones.\nThe oldest to support the new software is the iPhone 5S, from way back in\n2013.\n\nWhile continued support for such an old device is a minor aberration, it still\nserves as a reminder of quite how well Apple supports its handsets compared to\nAndroid manufacturers.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nApple says iOS 12 offers “up to 70% faster swipe to Camera”, “up to 50% faster\nkeyboard display” and “up to 2x faster app launch under heavy workload”. It\ntested this with an iPhone 6 Plus and pre-release software.\n\nWe tend to trade in relatively new hardware, but reports online suggest\nthere’s a significant improvement in the fluidity of iOS in older phones. Our\nassumption is that Apple has reworked the way the system uses its RAM, to keep\na little more available in phones that barely have any to start.\n\niOS has always been more RAM-frugal than Android, but that software in 2018\nhas been optimised for phones with as little as 1GB of RAM is impressive.\n\n## iOS 12 Battery monitoring\n\nSome of iOS 12’s features are made for people who like to hold onto their\nphones for a long time. Others are for the enthusiasts who like to make sure\nthey get the most from their iPhone.\n\nThe new battery monitoring feature feels as though it’s for the latter. In iOS\n11, you could look at a breakdown of apps by their percentage of battery use,\nover the past 24 hours and past week.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\niOS 12 adds graphs that let you view battery consumption and level per hour,\nwith a breakdown of background and “screen on” battery use. It’s overkill for\nmany of us, mind.\n\nBoth versions let you look out for excessive battery consumption in apps you\nbarely use, and the battery health section shows how much the capacity has\ndrained since the phone was new. MacBooks have a similar feature, although\nit’s more accessible in iOS 12.\n\n## Siri\n\niOS 12 adds new abilities to Siri, too, in the form of Siri Shortcuts. You add\nthese in Settings, not Siri’s own interface.\n\nTo an extent, this is proof Siri’s AI isn’t mind-blowing. It amounts to you\nprogramming Siri so it works better. However, it will make the voice assistant\nfar more useful for many of us. And for that reason it gets a big thumbs-up.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe shortcuts area suggests phrases you might want to add to Siri as these\nshortcuts. For example, that might mean travelling home using Citymapper,\nplaying the latest episode of a favourite podcast, setting an alarm, or\nsending someone a message in WhatsApp.\n\nThat it does away with having to mention the specific app in your voice\ncommand is the key. You programme in the specificity so the eventual\ninteraction feels more natural.\n\n## iOS 12 Notifications and Face ID\n\nLike every version of iOS, 12 has a number of minor tweaks you’ll stumble\nacross one day, then wonder if they’ve actually been part of iOS for an age. A\nfew are worth noting.\n\nFirst, Face ID now lets you set up an “alternative” appearance. Given it\ndoesn’t tend to struggle with glasses, and should have no problem on days\nwhere you wear a bit more make-up, this is for more marked changes.\n\nDo you wear a wig on occasion that changes your hairline? Want Face ID to\nrecognise your drag queen alter ego – and why wouldn’t you? Or look past heavy\nstage makeup? This feature should help.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\niOS 12 also adds Quiet Notifications. These will show in the dropdown display,\nbut won’t cause a sound alert or appear at the top of the display when they\narrive.\n\nYou’ll want to use this for apps whose notifications you don’t want to kill\nentirely, but have no particular desire to see immediately. The Podcasts app\nmight be a good use for this feature, since most of us don’t drop everything\nto listen to a new episode of a favourite series as soon as it comes in.\n\nTo use Quiet Notifications, go to the dropdown menu and swipe a notification\nas if you were going to dismiss it, then tap Manage. You’ll see the option to\nuse the new notification type here.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe way notifications are displayed in general has altered, too. Finally,\nApple has started grouping them by app, in the same manner as Android.\nFacebook and WhatsApp will no longer bogart your notifications dropdown.\n\nThis means less scrolling through the Notifications menu. This part of iOS 12\ninstantly feels cleaner and better organised.\n\n**Have you been impressed by iOS 12? Let us know on Twitter @trustedreviews**\n\n"}
