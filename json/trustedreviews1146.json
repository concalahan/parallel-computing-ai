Whether its the melancholic greens of The Capital Wasteland or New\nVegas’ scorching, radioactive sands, the player controlled a lone wanderer in\na place begging to be discovered.**\n\nThis is still true with West Virginia in [Fallout\n76](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/fallout-76), but the personality\nhas been lessened in favour of mute spectres walking alongside you. But these\naren’t characters, but other players devoid of personality as they chase after\nthe same generic quest objectives.\n\nWhat I love about Fallout sadly isn’t here. No longer am I constantly stalked\nby a pervasive atmosphere of dread. No longer am I constantly aware of my\nsurroundings as albino radscorpions stalk across obliterated hillsides. To me,\nthis doesn’t feel like Fallout anymore.\n\nIt’s still capable of impressive immersion and rewarding character\ncustomisation, but the message behind the original Fallout has been buried\nunder an online experience far more interested in chasing trends than having\nsomething to say.\n\n**Related:**[ **Upcoming PS4\nGames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/upcoming-ps4-games-3530401)\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThis past weekend saw one of several Fallout 76 beta sessions taking place on\n[Xbox One](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/xbox-one-s), providing\nplayers a total of four hours to dig into Bethesda’s upcoming online RPG.\nStarting right from the beginning, you’re a newly awakened occupant of Vault\n76, the very first vault to open after the nuclear apocalypse.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Fallout 76](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Fallout 76 is a beautiful and lonely wasteland, in all the wrong ways\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/gaming/fallout-76-beautiful-lonely-\nwasteland-wrong-ways-3612215 \"Fallout 76 is a beautiful and lonely wasteland,\nin all the wrong ways\")\n\n  * [ ![Daily Deals](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Lowest PlayStation Classic Price, Over £70 off a SanDisk 480GB SSD – Daily\nDeals\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/lowest-playstation-classic-price-\nover-70-off-sandisk-480gb-ssd-daily-deals-3612261 \"Lowest PlayStation Classic\nPrice, Over £70 off a SanDisk 480GB SSD – Daily Deals\")\n\n  *   * [ ![super smash bros ultimate](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Upcoming Nintendo Switch Games 2018\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/upcoming-nintendo-switch-games-3522184\n\"Upcoming Nintendo Switch Games 2018\")\n\n  * \n\nIt begins much like Fallout 3 and 4 before it as you’re walking through a\nlong-abandoned vault, filled with amenities designed to help humanity thrive\nbut remain unused. Well, it’s meant to be like that, but Fallout 76 sacrifices\nmuch of its atmosphere to shuffle you out the door in a matter of minutes.\n\nYou’re given a number of items to help you survive in the wasteland such as\nfood and water to maintain hunger gauges and other busywork. Among these is\nC.A.M.P, a new piece of technology to help you construct buildings and items\nin the same way as Fallout 4’s settlement mechanics.\n\nIt’s intuitively introduced, but the smiling Vault Boy on the screen is a\nhollow substitute for personality. Players began appearing as I approach the\nVault’s exit. Predictably, their first instinct was to sprint up to me and\nbegin punching me in the face, tearing away any immersion I could have in a\nworld I was yet to step into.\n\nIt’s a shame, because West Virginia is a vast and beautiful place somewhat\nuntouched by nuclear devastation. Country roads are awash with vegetation, a\nwonderfully stark contrast to the wrecked restaurants and facilities scattered\nacross the opening area.\n\n**Related:**[ **Best Xbox One\nGames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/xbox-one-games-3435271)\n\n![Fallout\n76](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nOne of the most notable omissions in Fallout 76 is the distinct lack of NPCs.\nYou’re the first people to settle in this new world with the exception of\nrobot merchants scattered around the place. They exist to sell you items and\ndeliver quests, with lore designated to letters and audio logs you’ll find\nthrough exploration.\n\nThe first few quests are small ventures across West Virginia as you sign up as\na “Responder” and test various water samples before eventually manning your\nfirst settlement. An introduction that could have featured players working\nalongside one another turns into a grim exercise of tedium as voiceless\navatars scurry about the place like ants.\n\nMy usual experience for missions in the opening hours saw me moving from one\nlocation to the next, occasionally bumping into other players awkwardly\nbumbling around like I was. I can see this coming alive in later levels as\nplayers band together to take on rival factions across West Virginia, but now,\nit feels oddly unfinished.\n\nAside from the lack of meaningful questing, characters and atmosphere, West\nVirginia is still a curious joy to uncover. It’s vast, with locations brimming\nwith contextual importance and imagination. Delving into the Nuka Cola Factory\nand coming across oodles of fizzy drinks and loot was rewarding, and echoes\nwhat I love about past instalments.\n\n**Related:**[ **Upcoming Nintendo Switch\nGames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/upcoming-nintendo-switch-\ngames-3522184)\n\n![Fallout\n76](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nBethesda has incorporated live events in a similar vein to Destiny 2, where\nyou and a few nearby players in the shared world must defend objectives from\nhordes of enemies. These are fun little instances, but the gunplay lacks the\nspeed and finesse required for teamwork to feel worthwhile.\n\nFor example, dispatching groups of enemies devolved into endless grenade\nspamming until everything stopped moving. It becomes a laughable mixture of\nunintentional and clumsy mechanics that simply don’t feel built for a fully-\nfledged multiplayer venture. There’s a charm to it, but how this plays out in\nthe full release remains unclear.\n\nUpon the beta’s conclusion, I had crafted a small shelter for myself\nconsisting of a few wooden planks, a sleeping bag, and a fireplace. It felt\nhomely despite the apocalyptic nasties shifting all around me. But no players\npassed me, echoing a lonely feeling of dissatisfaction as opposed to what\nBethesda presumably wants to convey.\n\nI imagine teaming up with a group of dedicated friends is where Fallout 76\ncomes alive. Commenting on the silly (and occasionally buggy) happenings of\nWest Virginia as you embark on quests and deal out loot. The new perk card\nsystem also feels suited to this, with each squad member possessing abilities\nto compliment the overall team. To put it bluntly, don’t go in expecting a\nsatisfying solo experience.\n\nThe jury is still out on Fallout 76, and I’m hopeful it has ample surprises in\nstore with how players work together and the world of West Virginia opens up\nafter the pile of tutorials I had to wade through. For now, it’s a former\nshell of what made Fallout so special in the first place. War never changes,\nbut Fallout certainly has.\n\n**Fallout 76 launches for PS4, Xbox One and PC on November 14.
