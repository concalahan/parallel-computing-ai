You’ve got your HDMI cable. But what is HDMI ARC, and why\nshould you care?**\n\nTV spec sheets can seem like a mess of acronyms at the best of times, but one\nthat you’ll have seen crop up more than most is HDMI ARC.\n\nThat’s because it’s kind of a big deal. It stands for Audio Return Channel,\nand if you’ve had a new TV since 2009, you may have even been using it without\nknowing it.\n\nBut getting clued up on what it is and why it matters is key to ensuring you\nget the most from your TV setup. Thankfully, we’re here to help, with\neverything you need to know.\n\n**Related:[Best TVs](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-tv-3440232)**\n\n## What is HDMI ARC?\n\nHDMI has been carrying pictures and audio from source to receiver since its\ninception in 2004. But when ARC launched five years later in 2009, it opened\nup HDMI to sending audio both ways – known as “downstream” and “upstream” –\nusing one cable.\n\nWhy would you want to do this? It means that not only can an HDMI cable carry\nsound downstream from a Blu-ray player or games console to your TV, but also\nupstream from your TV to a soundbar or AV receiver.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n**John Lewis Deal:[Up to £500 off these phenomenal LG TVs – just in time for\nthe World\nCup](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1203&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-\nTVWorldcup&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnlewis.com%2Fbrowse%2Fc10139110001%3F)**\n\nPreviously, you would have had to use an optical cable to send the audio from\nyour TV, with HDMI handled the pictures. Having ARC on board makes for a much\nmore streamlined solution, particularly when it comes to wall-mounted TVs.\n\nHDMI ARC has increased in popularity along with the rise of soundbars. A\npopular user scenario is to plug various sources (games console, Blu-ray\nplayer, streaming box) into your TV’s various HDMI sockets, then have the one\nHDMI cable going from the TV to your soundbar. This ensures all your sources\nhave their audio needs taken care of. It’s an approach favoured by many\nsoundbars with a single HDMI input, such as the new [Sonos\nBeam](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sonos-beam).\n\n## Does my TV support ARC?\n\nThe likelihood is, if you’ve bought a new TV in the last eight or so years, it\nprobably supports HDMI ARC.\n\nYou’ll need to find out which HDMI ports on it are ARC-compatible, though –\nit’s often just one, rather than the whole lot.\n\nThankfully, it will usually be labelled as HDMI ARC, making it easy to spot\nwhich port you’ll want to use.\n\n![HDMI\nARC](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## HDMI ARC – do I need a new cable?\n\nNo. Your existing HDMI cables will work just fine, so you don’t need to buy\nnew ones.\n\n## HDMI ARC vs HDMI CEC – are they the same thing?\n\nWhile the ability to send audio both ways is important, ARC was primarily\nintroduced as part of improving HDMI CEC.\n\nAnother acronym? Afraid so. CEC stands for Consumer Electronics Control, and\nit’s another ‘behind the scenes’ thing that’s working to make your AV setup\nsimpler. Except that hasn’t always been the case.\n\nHDMI CEC was created to enable all devices connected by HDMI to work as one.\nIt means that you don’t need to switch off your soundbar or Blu-ray player\nseparately – if you switch off your TV, they too will power down.\n\nIt also prevents you needing to use 33 different remotes to get all you kit\nsinging from the same hymn sheet. One remote should work for universal\nfunctions such as volume and power across all your sources, provided it’s set\nup correctly – you’ll need to look for an HDMI CEC or HDMI Control option in\nall your device’s settings menu and set it to ‘on’.\n\nJust to confuse matters, some manufacturers have put their own name on this –\nSamsung calls it Anynet+, while Sony calls it Bravia Sync. Check your TV’s\nmanual for more information.\n\nIn the early days, incompatibility between different manufacturers’ kit meant\nthis didn’t work as smoothly as it should. ARC’s improved ability to send\ninformation both ways made this ‘handshaking’ procedure much more reliable – a\nmulti-talented acronym after all.\n\nAnd so, HDMI ARC and HDMI CEC aren’t the same thing, but there definitely is\nan overlap.\n\n**Related:[Best soundbars and\nsoundbases](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-soundbar-3450266)**\n\n![HDMI\nARC](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## HDMI ARC vs HDMI eARC\n\nThe only problem with ARC is that it was originally made to support the same\naudio formats as the optical connection it replaces. This means it isn’t\nguaranteed to support the more advanced audio formats that HDMI would usually\noffer.\n\nThis is because some TV manufacturers have recently started to output Dolby\nDigital Plus (up to 5.1) over ARC, and some AV receivers and soundbars have\nstarted to support it too. But the ‘ifs’, ‘ands’ and ‘buts’ around it don’t\nmake it easy to understand.\n\nThe idea is that eARC should change all that. It stands for Enhanced Audio\nReturn Channel, which will be introduced as part of [HDMI\n2.1](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/what-is-hdmi-2-1-specs-\nexplained-2948941) this year. It ups the bandwidth, and will support\nuncompressed audio formats all the way up to [Dolby\nAtmos](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/what-is-dolby-atmos-2942509) and\nDTS: X.\n\n**John Lewis Deal:[Up to £500 off these phenomenal LG TVs – just in time for\nthe World\nCup](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1203&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-\nTVWorldcup&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnlewis.com%2Fbrowse%2Fc10139110001%3F)**\n\nIt will also make for faster data transfer – for pictures and audio – meaning\ncommon HDMI issues such as lip-syncing problems will be a thing of the past.\n\nUnlike before, you’ll need to upgrade your HDMI cables to get this support.\nYou’ll also need working HDMI 2.1 ports as well, at both source and receiver.\nDefinitely something to keep an eye out for if you’re shopping for a new TV or\nsoundbar in 2018.\n\n**What do you look for when choosing a new TV?
