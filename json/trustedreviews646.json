And\nour one to avoid? More on that later, but let’s just say for now it quite\nliterally belongs in the toilet.\n\n**Related:[Remix IO is a 4K HDR Android media box that does it\nall](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/remix-io-is-an-android-running-all-\nin-one-media-device-making-it-our-kickstarter-of-the-week)**\n\n## What is Bixi?\n\n![bixi\ncooking](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nBixi is a sensor that lets you add hands-free commands to a whole bunch of\ndevices. Touchscreens? Sure, they’re great, but they’re not ideal in all\nsituations, which is where gesture controls come in.\n\nCooking and want to scroll to the next part of a recipe without muddying your\n£600 phone? No problem. Don’t want to take your eyes off the road to take a\ncall driving? Very sensible. Can’t fiddle with audio controls when cycling?\nNow you don’t have to.\n\nThese are just some of the things Bixi can help you do with nothing more than\nthe wave of a hand, so let’s dive a little deeper.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n## Why is it interesting?\n\nBecause it’s so versatile. You can use it with apps, LifX smart lightbulbs,\nBose Soundtouch speakers, GoPro cameras, tablets, and all sorts of Internet of\nThings devices.\n\nNot only that, it can control multiple actions at the same time, so you can\nride your bike with Bixi on both Music and GoPro profiles, and control your\ntunes and action cam with just a wave of the hand.\n\n![bixi\nbike](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIt will even display turn-by-turn directions using the LEDs, meaning it\ndoubles as a handlebar-mounted bike sat-nav, and is ideal for the car as it\nmeans you can use all your in-car gadgets without taking your eyes off the\nroad.\n\nPlus, it works with Apple TV, Philips Hue, Spotify, Sonos, Sony TV, Nest,\nKindle, Deezer and more. Basically, it’s your ticket to a hands-free\nhousehold.\n\n**Related:[SkunkLock makes bike thieves vomit in their scummy\nsteps](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/skunklock-is-a-bike-lock-that-\nsprays-thieves-with-a-vomit-inducing-deterrent-making-it-our-kickstarter-of-\nthe-week)  \n**  \nSo how does the magic happen? Bixi works on the principle of [If This Then\nThat (IFTTT)](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ifttt-tutorial-guide-\napplets), so when it’s set to control one device, certain gestures act as\ncertain triggers to activate an action.\n\nWaving up will scroll down your smartphone’s screen, for example, while\nraising your hand will increase the volume of the song that’s playing.\n\n![bixi\nmain](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nOnce it’s registered your hand gesture, it sends a Bluetooth Low Energy signal\nto the Bixi app on your smartphone, which then reads the signal and sends a\ncommand to your paired device either through Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.\n\nIt detects hand movements up to 25cm in front of itself, so you don’t need to\nbe close to use it, and pairing is a doddle, too – just tap Pair, choose your\nprofiles and hit Sync. That’s it.\n\nThe battery should also last a long time before needing recharging. According\nto the makers, it’ll go for between three weeks to two months when always\nconnected.\n\n## What are the challenges?\n\n![bixi\noffice](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCrowdfunding is a risky business. When you back a project, you’re not buying\nit like you would from Amazon, but rather giving financial assistance to the\nteam making it.\n\nIn most cases, things go smoothly and backers get their products but there’s\nno guarantees, so consult the [Kickstarter Backer\nFAQs](https://www.kickstarter.com/help/faq/backer+questions) if you’re unsure\nabout how things work.\n\n**Related:[The MVR Ascend is a British-made Gear VR\nrival](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/the-mvr-ascend-h1-lets-you-\nplay-gta-5-in-vr-on-ps4-xbox-one-and-pc-immerse-yourself-in-this-week-s-\nfeatured-kickstarter)**\n\nCommon roadblocks include supply shortages and production issues, but the team\nbehind Bixi say they’re on target to deliver the first pre-series units on\ntime. Fingers crossed things stay that way.\n\nThe pre-series units should go out in January, but early bird backers won’t\nget theirs until March.\n\n## Is there anything similar available?\n\n![bixi\npainting](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nYes. Leap Motion, Myo and Fibaro Home Intelligence all do a similar job, but\nBixi is the only one that’s ultra-portable, robust enough to use outdoors, has\nbuilt-in gesture processing, and still manages to sound simple to use.\n\n**Related:[AER lets you lob your GoPro into the\nair](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/aer-lets-you-lob-your-gopro-into-the-\nair-and-is-our-kickstarter-of-the-week)**\n\nWith early birds starting at $79 (£63), it’s also one of the more affordable\noptions.\n\n## Should I crowdfund this?\n\nIf it makes reading a recipe on your phone easier while cooking, we’re all in\nfavour, as we’ve lost count of the number of times our phone has been covered\nin flour.\n\nOne step up from the $79 early bird is the home and car package, which costs\n$119 (£95). This gives you two Bixis – one for your home, and one for your\ncar. Of course, you can use them anywhere you like, such as on your bike, for\ninstance.\n\n## And our one to avoid…  \n\n![illumibowl\n2.0](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n[IllumiBowl\n2.0](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1585372093/illumibowl-2-toilet-\nnight-light-sharktank-upgrade?ref=category_popular). Yes, these light-up\ntoilet seats are still around, about 10 years after they first surfaced. If\nyou can’t find the toilet on your own you don’t deserve to be in charge of\nmoney.\n\n**What do you think of Bixi? Let us know in the comments below.**\n\n"}
