{"result": 0, "title": "Google Home Hub Review | Trusted Reviews", "description": "* ![Google Home Hub side]()I love the new Home View option, with the ability to control your smart homewith touch as well as voice increasing the options available. With Googlecatching up with Alexa regarding the range of supported devices, the GoogleHome Hub is a smart home device that will suit the majority of people.Yet, there are still some frustrations. YouTube support is great, but why nothave full Chromecast support to send content from Netflix (Amazon Prime Videoisn’t Chromecast enabled)? And, the lack of support for G Suite accounts is acontinued annoyance for some people.When it comes to media and music, the Echo Show (2nd Gen) is a better choice;for general voice assistant duties and direct smart home control, I’d go withthe Home Hub.## Score"}
