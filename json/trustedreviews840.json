For the iPhone 8 and iPhone X, we even have a new name.\nGone is A10 Fusion, and say hello to A11 Bionic. Why’s it Bionic? Marketing\njargon mostly, but this chip does assist in speeding up image recognition\nincluding biometrics. Apple says it’s the “most powerful, and smartest chip\never in a smartphone”.\n\n**Related:[iPhone X](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-x-release-\ndate-specs-features-uk-price-2951157)**\n\nWhat’s new? First, it’s a six-core processor. “Exciting,” you think, and\nindeed it is, but just remember that more cores on a phone isn’t the same as\nmore cores on your laptop.\n\nThere are two “performance” cores and four “high-efficiency cores” for a total\nof six. This chip design is similar to big.LITTLE, created by British company\nARM. Without going too in-depth, this is known as ‘heterogeneous computing’,\nwhich is effectively allows devices to run on processors that have cores of\ndifferent specifications. This unlike a processor in your PC, where all the\nprocessor cores are exactly the same.\n\nCompared to last year’s A10 Fusion, Apple claims 25% better performance from\nthose all-important performance cores, while the four high-efficiency cores\nwill collectively be 70% faster for background tasks. What’s more exciting is\nthat the controller, which decides what cores get which tasks, now allows all\nsix cores to work on the same task, allowing for 70% faster multi-threaded\nworkloads.\n\nIn terms of graphics performance, the GPU is said to be 30% faster than last\nyear’s, while consuming half the power when working at the same rate as the\nA10. That’s impressive and will help battery life when it comes to gaming.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nThe A11 Bionic includes a faster image signal processor for better camera\nperformance, better pixel processing and better noise reduction.\n\n**Related:[iPhone launch live\nstream](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-launch-event-live-stream-\ntime-watch-online-apple-september-12-3286290)**\n\nBig.LITTLE-like designs aren’t unique to Apple’s chip designs; the likes of\nthe Samsung Exynos 8895 and the Qualcomm [Snapdragon\n835](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/snapdragon-835-phones-processor-\nspecs-speed-benchmark-chipset-cores-2944086) SoC feature this sort of\narchitecture. But what’s new here is the doubling of the number of lower-power\nprocessors, which nobody else has done yet. It’ll be interesting to see\nwhether Apple is able to improve battery life by shunting off more tasks to\nthe lower-power cores. We had big complaints about the battery life on the\niPhone 7, so it’s here where the A11 Bionic’s power -saving will be most\napparent.\n\nWhen benchmark results start rolling in, we’ll update this page.\n\n**Related:[Best iPhone](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-iphone)**\n\n**Let us know what you think of Apple’s new A11 chip by tweeting us\n@TrustedReviews.**\n\n"}
