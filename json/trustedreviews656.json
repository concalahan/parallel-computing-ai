Samsung prototypes a lot and\nthings change extremely rapidly.”\n\nAlthough the insider has failed to offer any detailed insight into the phone’s\nfinalised specs sheet, they have suggested the handset is benchmarking with\nonly marginally better performance than its predecessor, the [Galaxy\nS5](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-s5-review).\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n“As far as performance, benchmarks are noticeably higher but not by earth\nshattering amounts,” they stated. “Overall device responsiveness is vastly\nimproved, and memory consumption is way down.”\n\nThey added: “[It’s] not just specs Samsung is focusing on this time around.\nI’ve heard lots of rumblings about crazy new designs (and I’m not just talking\nGalaxy Alpha ‘redesigns’ either.)”\n\n**Related:**[Samsung Galaxy Note 5 release\ndate](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-5-release-date-\nrumours-news-specs-and-price)\n\nWhile we must stress that these questionable claims be taken with a\nconsiderable pinch of salt, reports of a reworked design have long been linked\nwith the S6.\n\nAs well as an all-new look, past reports have claimed the Galaxy S6 will\nfollow the Galaxy Note 4 in adopting a 2560 x 1440 pixel QHD display and an\nimproved, optical-image-stabilised camera.\n\nPower will also be improved, with the S6 expected to be one of the first\nhandsets to come running Qualcomm’s new 64-bit Snapdragon 810 processor.\n\n"}
