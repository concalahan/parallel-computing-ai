[Super Smash\nBros](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/smash-bros-ultimate-release-date-\nnews-gameplay-2949964) will be one of the first big titles to launch with the\nservice so expect it to play a big part in its success.\n\n**Related:[Upcoming Nintendo Switch\nGames](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/upcoming-nintendo-switch-\ngames-3522184)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Nintendo Switch Online Service Cloud Saves – how do they work?\n\nCloud Saves are one of the headline features of the Nintendo Switch Online\nService, and allow for the majority of saved content to be uploaded to the\ncloud for safe keeping.\n\nHowever, and quite bizarrely, some titles are exempt from this service such as\nSplatoon 2, ARMS and the forthcoming [Dark Souls\nRemastered](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/dark-souls-remastered) and\n[FIFA 19](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/fifa-19-release-date-\ngameplay-3379113). The reason for this, according to Nintendo, is to stop\nplayers from cheating by taking advantage of save data exploits.\n\n## Nintendo Switch Virtual Console – Is it coming?\n\nSpeaking to Kotaku, a Nintendo spokesperson has confirmed that Virtual Console\nwill not be coming to Nintendo Switch in future.\n\n“There are currently no plans to bring classic games together under the\nVirtual Console banner as has been done on other Nintendo systems.”\n\nPast Nintendo systems allowed players to purchase an assortment of classic\ntitles ranging multiple platforms including the NES, SNES, Nintendo 64, DS and\nWii. Not having hundred of these at our fingertips is a bit of letdown.\n\nIt seems, the online service’s Netflix-style subscription service will act as\na replacement of sorts for Virtual Console going forward.\n\n**Related:[Black Friday Nintendo\nSwitch](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/nintendo-switch-deals-black-\nfriday-2993180)**\n\n**What are your thoughts on the Nintendo Switch Online Service?
