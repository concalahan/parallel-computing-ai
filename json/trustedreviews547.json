With the UK’s next-gen mobile network’s spectrum auction now\ncomplete, tests well underway, and the first commercial launches set for 2019,\nwe** **reveal all about 5G vs 4G and the future of mobile connectivity.**\n\nIt’s not long now until we’ll be seeing [5G\nphones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/5g-mobile-phones-smartphones-\nsamsung-galaxy-s10-note-10-qualcomm-snapdragon-3386308) hit shelves in the UK,\nUS, and all over the world. The already launched [Moto Z3\nPlay](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/moto-z3-play), for instance, will\nbe getting a 5G-enabling Moto Mod in early-2019, while next year’s eagerly\nanticipated [Galaxy\nS10](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/galaxy-s10-release-date-specs-\nrumours-3456012) is expected to be among the first devices to ship with a\n5G-ready modem (likely the Qualcomm [Snapdragon\nX50](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/qualcomm-unveils-\nsnapdragon-x50-world-first-5g-modem-2935894)). Many other manufacturers,\nincluding OnePlus, Huawei and Xiaomi, have teased similar plans.\n\nFurthermore, the international standards organisation\n[3GPP](http://www.3gpp.org/news-events/3gpp-news/1965-rel-15_news) has now\ndefined the ‘Release 15’ 5G standard, which means everyone now has a shared\ngoal for which technology to implement. In the UK, the 5G spectrum auction is\nnow a distant memory, meaning that the likes of EE, Vodafone, Three and O2\nhave purchased the network capacity to support the next generation of mobile\nservices and are beginning to figure out how they’ll deploy it.\n\nRead on for everything you need to know about 5G in the UK.\n\n## Latest 5G UK News: EE switches on live 5G trial in London\n\nEE has claimed the latest scalp in the UK 5G wars, announcing that it has\nlaunched real-life trials of the next-gen network in London’s Canary Wharf.\n\nUtilising Huawei kit and a slice of the 3.4GHz spectrum it claimed at the 2018\nOfcom 5G auction, the exact location is Montgomery Square in E14, which was\nselected because of its high footfall – on average, some 150,000 people pass\nthrough it every day.\n\n“This is the latest milestone in our 5G rollout – a live test of our 5G\nnetwork, in a hugely busy ‘hotspot’, where we know there’s going to be demand\nfrom customers for increased mobile capacity. With constant upgrades to 4G,\nand laying the foundations for 5G, we’re working to always be able to deliver\nwhat our customers need – both consumers and the vertical industries that will\nmake the greatest use of 5G,” commented Fotis Karonis, 5G Technology Lead at\nBT Group.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Xiaomi Mi A2](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Xiaomi smartphones will be available from Three in November\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/xiaomi-three-uk-3612189 \"Xiaomi\nsmartphones will be available from Three in November\")\n\n  * [ ![ps1](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### PlayStation Classic: Sony releases complete list of 20 games on the\nconsole\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/playstation-classic-mini-release-date-\npreorder-3583798 \"PlayStation Classic: Sony releases complete list of 20 games\non the console\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Hive View Outdoor](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Hive View Outdoor security camera can catch burglars before they strike\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/hive-view-outdoor-security-\ncamera-3612152 \"Hive View Outdoor security camera can catch burglars before\nthey strike\")\n\n  * \n\nLater this month, EE is to due to fire up 10 more live 5G tests in another\nbusy part of the capital – east London’s ‘Tech City’ cluster – with all the\nongoing work building towards eventual 5G commercial rollout in 2019. The\nexact date remains undisclosed at this time.\n\nRival network O2 is hot on its heels and is due to commence its own real world\n5G trials at a number of locations, including the O2 Arena.\n\n## What is 5G?\n\n![5g](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIf you’re in the UK, you’re probably using a mobile phone with 4G internet –\nor 3G, if you’re in the sticks. Simply put, 5G is the name for the next big\nleap in mobile connectivity.\n\nCurrently, numerous phone networks, device suppliers and governments around\nthe world are hard at work trying to figure out a good way to deliver next-\ngeneration mobile internet, and we still haven’t seen exactly how it will be\nimplemented at scale, though as we’ve just said, live testing is now underway\non a limited scale.\n\nOne thing we do know is that you’re going to need a new phone to take\nadvantage of the new technology. 5G is a big jump, and that means phones will\nneed new modem chips to connect to it. Qualcomm is expected to be at the\nforefront of this, with the release of its long-awaited 5G Snapdragon X50\nmodem scheduled for late-2018/early-2019. This will pave the way for handset\nmanufacturers, especially Android ones, to release their first fully 5G-ready\ndevices.\n\n## How fast is 5G? 5G vs 4G speeds compared\n\nIn practice, this next generation of mobile networks will lead to much faster\nmobile speeds, theoretically raising them to be able to deliver over 1Gbps.\nNetwork latency should also be reduced down to a theoretical 1ms from 45ms on\n4G.\n\nExact speeds will vary based on which technology ends up being implemented.\nSamsung says it’s managed to achieve 7.5Gbps, while Nokia claims a more\nimpressive 10Gbps. There’s also Huawei, which has managed 3.6Gbps.\n\nWhen you compare that to the best speeds in the UK – EE’s 300Mbps LTE-A\nnetwork – then we could be talking about a 12-fold speed increase. Of course,\nactual real world performance will vary. As anyone who’s ever used a 4G phone\ncan attest, you’re never going to get the full 300Mbps that the standard is\ntechnically capable of due to a combination of signal strength and the amount\nof load on the network.\n\n**Related:[Best Android phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-android-\nphones-1_round-up)**\n\n![network](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Is it all about download speeds?\n\nNot quite, it’s also expected to usher in lower latency. Latency, or lag, is\nthe time it takes for the item you’re trying to download to actually start\ndownloading. For instance, when you press play on Netflix, there’s a very\nshort delay before the content begins to stream to your device.\n\nLatency will be very familiar to gamers, where the concept can have a far more\nsignificant impact. When you perform an action in a multiplayer game, the lag\nis the delay between you hitting a button on your keyboard and the game server\nactually receiving that command. So 5G on mobile will hugely improve latency –\npossibly to the point where serious online gaming using your phone connection\nwould become a reality.\n\nThere are obvious advantages for consumer use, but the implications for the\n‘internet of things’ could end up being far more profound. Driverless cars\ncurrently do all of their processing on-board, but the low latency allowed by\n5G could mean that essential information could be quickly transmitted in order\nto prevent accidents.\n\n## When will 5G actually launch in the UK?\n\nIn the UK, 5G is expected to see a widespread rollout by 2020 and it looks\nlike we’re progressing towards this milestone very nicely. ‘Release 16’ of the\n5G standard is due to be revealed in December , which paves the way for\noperators to start delivering the service to customers next year. In fact, all\nof the major UK mobile networks have revealed their 5G testing plans, and most\nare saying they’ll be ready to launch in 2019.\n\nHowever, while it won’t surprise you to hear that the mobile networks are\ngetting very competitive with their rollouts, it’s important to note that\nwhatever ends up being released first is likely to offer a fraction of the\nfunctionality of what 5G will eventually be capable of. All that matters is\nwhether buying a new handset too early will lock you out of new features when\nthey’re eventually released, and for that we’ll have to wait and see what\nhappens in 2019 and beyond.\n\nStill, from all these developments, it’s clear that each major provider is\ntreating 5G very seriously indeed – and that’s ultimately going to be good\nnews for consumers itching to stream Netflix that little bit faster.\n\nJust don’t hold your breath for it happening just yet.\n\n**How do you think 5G will change the world?
