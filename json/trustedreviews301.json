This is\napparently because the new colour options are part of a ‘limited edition’ run\nmade in partnership with Danish design outfit HAY – though neither party has\nsaid just how many units will be manufactured.\n\n“The fundamental goal at Sonos is to give our customers an amazing listening\nexperience. Our product design philosophy focuses on achieving the elegant\nintegration of domestic life and sound design,” Sonos Vice President of\nDesign, Tad Toulis, said in a statement.\n\n**Related:[Best multi-room\nspeakers](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-wireless-speakers)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n###  Colourful new Sonos One speakers get a release date – and a price hike\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/sonos-one-colours-release-date-\nprice-3613447 \"Colourful new Sonos One speakers get a release date – and a\nprice hike\")\n\n  * [ ![Cyber Monday UK 2018](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Cyber Monday UK 2018: When is Cyber Monday 2018?\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/cyber-monday-uk-2018-3342930 \"Cyber\nMonday UK 2018: When is Cyber Monday 2018?\")\n\n  *   * [ ![best horror films](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Halloween 2018: Best horror movies and scary films to watch on Netflix UK\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/best-horror-movies-netflix-halloween-\nfilms-3607041 \"Halloween 2018: Best horror movies and scary films to watch on\nNetflix UK\")\n\n  * \n\nThe new Sonos One flavours were first announced in September and will be\navailable to buy from November 5 at Sonos’ flagship stores in London and\nBerlin, as well as online.\n\n**Excited** **by the colourful new Sonos One speakers?
