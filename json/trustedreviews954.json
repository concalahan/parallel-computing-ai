This season we’ve seen dancing, murder, and a fair bit of\nracing. While there’s less dancing this week, instead you’ll be searching for\nammo and shooting clay pigeons, there’s still a bit of murder, only this time\nnear corrupted zones. It wouldn’t be Fortnite if there wasn’t at least a small\namount of killing to be had.\n\n## Fortnite Season 6 – Free Battle Pass Challenges\n\n**Fortnite Season 6 Week 4 Challenges: Use a Port-a-Fort or Port-a-Fortress in\ndifferent matches 0/5**\n\nThis sounds easy enough, but it all comes down to luck. Your highest chance of\nfinding either Port types is in chests and supply drops. If you’re going for\nchests, aim for somewhere with a high chest chance, like the blue house in\nSalty Springs or corrupted areas. For the supply drops, you can either play\nuntil end game, or head into 50v50, the latter of which offers more supply\ndrops over a smaller area.\n\n**Fortnite Season 6 Week 4 Challenges: Search an Ammo Box in different named\nlocations 0/7**\n\nHead to a named location, find an ammo box, and acquire its contents. Simple\nstuff, really. Just be sure to search every room in every house or building\nyou come across and this should pop without too much fuss.\n\n**Fortnite Season 6 Week 4 Challenges: Ring the doorbell of a house with an\nopponent inside in different matches 0/3 (HARD)**\n\nIf you’ve played since the most recent patch, you may have noticed the\naddition of doorbells. For this challenge you’ll need to ring three bells\nacross three separate matches. The key here is landing in a highly populated\narea. Salty Springs, Pleasant Park – anywhere with houses will work.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nThe other thing to keep in mind is to delay your landing slightly. Instead of\nlanding as quick as possible, land later. That way you’ll give an unwitting\nplayer the chance to enter a building first, leaving you free to knock, door,\nrun.\n\n**Related:[Best Nintendo Switch\nGames](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/nintendo-switch-games-3435122)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Fortnite Season 6 – Paid Battle Pass Challenges\n\n**Fortnite Season 6 Week 4 Challenges: Land at Greasy Grove 0/1**\n\nThis is another “land at” staged challenge. Last week had five locations, and\nthis week is no different. Once you’ve landed at Greasy you’ll need to head to\nthe following areas below in separate matches. If you’re doing this in 50v50,\nyou don’t need to land as soon as you get off the battle bus. If head to the\narea, build a ramp, then jump off and activate your glider, it’ll still count.\n\n  * **Land at Wailing Woods 0/1**\n  * **Land at Dusty Divot 0/1**\n  * **Land at Pleasant Park 0/1**\n  * **Land at Paradise Palms 0/1**\n\n**Fortnite Season 6 Week 4 Challenges: Dance on top of a clock tower 0/1**\n\nWell if this isn’t the single greatest challenge ever conceived, I don’t know\nwhat is. For this you’ll need to head to every default’s favourite landing\nzone, Tilted Towers. Keep an eye out for the slim building with a – _spoiler!_\n– clock tower on top. Land there do a little dance, make a little love, and\nget down tonight to complete this part of the challenge.\n\n  * **Dance on top of a Pink Tree 0/1**\n\nWhile the first part of this challenge was nice and obvious, the next two\nsections aren’t.\n\nFor the second stage of the challenge you’ll need to head to Lucky Landing. In\nthe middle of the zone is a four-walled structure, and in its centre, a\nmassive pink tree. So long as you keep your eyes open as you glide in, it’s\npretty hard to miss. Just keep in mind there’s often a chest buried directly\nbelow the tree, so land fast and emote, else others may chop down your\nchallenge.\n\n  * **Dance on top of a Porcelain Throne 0/1**\n\nYou’d be forgiven for hearing the word _throne_ and thinking of the new\nhaunted castle area. What this actually refers to, however, is the kind of\nthrone you sit on to relieve yourself. I.e. A toilet.\n\nHead on over to Flush Factory, the home of toilets in Fortnite, and directly\nin front of the main warehouse is a giant toilet. Again, you won’t miss it.\nYou may need to build up to it, but once you’ve danced on this loo that’s this\nchallenge complete.\n\n**Fortnite Season 6 Week 4 Challenges: Get a score of 3 or more at different\nShooting Galleries 0/5 (HARD)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIf you completed this challenge last season, you’ll kind of know what you’re\ndoing. The main difference this time around is you’ll need to stand on a small\nplatform at shoot at pop-up targets. Just make sure you stand still and don’t\nwalk off the platform and this one should fly by.\n\nThe locations are:\n\n  * At the base of the mountain east of Risky Reels\n  * In the forest area to the right of the main Wailing Woods base\n  * On top of the mountain overlooking Paradise Palms\n  * The north side of the mountain south-west of Fatal Fields\n  * Behind a toppled lorry west of the broken depot in Dusty Divot\n\n**Fortnite Season 6 Week 4 Challenges: Eliminate opponents near any of the\ncorrupted areas 0/3 (HARD)**\n\nYou’ve probably seen these already, but corrupted areas are the purple\nsections of the map. Each area contains between one and three chests, so the\ntrick here will be landing before anyone else and snagging all the good loot.\nDon’t worry about getting over-powered loot, anything that fires will do, so\nlong as you grab the gun first all your opponent can do is swing their pick\nwildly as you blast them into next-week.\n\nIf this is your first time on Trusted Reviews, feel free to check out the rest\nof our previous Fortnite Season 6 coverage below, including a challenge guide\nfor every week so far, new starter packs, and much, much more.\n\n  * [Fortnite Season 6 Week 1 Challenges](https://trustedreviews.com/news/fortnite-guide-how-to-complete-the-season-6-week-1-challenges-3594101)\n  * [Fortnite Season 6 Week 2 Challenges](https://trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-complete-the-season-6-week-2-challenges-3597851)\n  * [Fortnite Season 6 Week 3 Challenges](https://trustedreviews.com/news/fortnite-how-to-complete-season-6-week-3-challenges-3602540)\n  * [How to Unlock the Calamity and Dire Skins](https://trustedreviews.com/news/fortnite-skin-guide-season-6-3594139)\n  * [What comes in the Deep Freeze Bundle?](https://trustedreviews.com/news/fortnite-guide-whats-deep-freeze-bundle-3601884)\n  * [What are the best guns in Battle Royal?](https://trustedreviews.com/news/fortnite-battle-royale-best-guns-p90-3584777)\n  * [All the new skins, patch notes, updates, and LTMs](https://trustedreviews.com/news/fortnite-season-6-news-update-skins-weapons-battle-pass-challenges-3505854)\n\nYou can also check out our [Fortnite Season 6\nhub](https://trustedreviews.com/news/fortnite-season-6-news-update-skins-\nweapons-battle-pass-challenges-3505854) for all the latest additions, patch\nnotes, and game-changing weapons.\n\n**And be sure to follow us on Facebook or Twitter, @TrustedReviews, for\neverything Fortnite.**\n\n"}
