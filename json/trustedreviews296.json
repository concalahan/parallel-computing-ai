We take a closer look at Samsung’s new virtual assistant and\nSiri rival, Bixby, which is now available in the UK on the[Galaxy\nS8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-s8-review) and newly\nlaunched [Galaxy Note 8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-\nnote-8-release-date-specs-rumours-price-uk-2993139).**\n\nAfter months of rumours and leaks, the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy Note 8 – along\nwith the [Galaxy S8+](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-s8-plus-\nreview) – are all out in the wild, complete with high-end designs that bring\ngenuine innovation to smartphone aesthetics, the latest hardware, and those\nall-important curvy edges on the screen.\n\nBut there’s one new feature that has us particularly intrigued. There’s been a\nlot of talk about Samsung’s AI ambitions since it snapped up Viv in 2016 – an\nAI platform developed by the team behind Siri.\n\nJust what the company had planned remained unclear at first, but as the Galaxy\nS8 launch neared, reports of a new virtual assistant to rival the likes of\nSiri, and Google’s recently launched Google Assistant, began to crop up.\n\nNow, all has been revealed, with Samsung first confirming the presence of its\nnew assistant, Bixby, on the Galaxy S8. However, until now many of us hadn’t\nhad a real taste of Bixby, as its initial release was restricted to South\nKorea and, shortly after, the US. That’s all changed now, though, with Bixby\navailable in the UK, Australia, South Africa, and many more countries – and\nwe’ve a shiny new Samsung phablet in the Galaxy Note 8 to appreciate it on.\n\n**Related:[Bixby Voice UK](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/bixby-voice-\nuk-3251722)**\n\nSo, just what is Bixby all about? Is it just another Siri clone, or has\nSamsung managed to transfer its smartphone design innovation to the AI aspect\nof its new handset?\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nAllow us to explain…\n\n**Related:[Galaxy S8 vs\nS8+](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/galaxy-s8-vs-s8-plus)**\n\n![galaxys8\n27](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)_The new Galaxy S8_\n\n## What is Bixby?\n\nAs mentioned, Bixby is Samsung’s take on the personal virtual assistant. Think\nSiri, Cortana, and Google Assistant, but with a few extras thrown in. Here’s\nSamsung on the new feature:\n\n“Samsung has a conceptually new philosophy to target this problem: instead of\nhumans learning how a machine interacts with the world (a reflection of the\ndesigners’ abilities), it is the machine that needs to learn and adapt to us.\nThe interface must be natural and intuitive enough to flatten the learning\ncurve regardless of the number of functions being added. With this new\napproach, Samsung has employed artificial intelligence, reinforcing deep\nlearning concepts to the core of our user interface designs. Bixby is the\nongoing result of this effort.”\n\nMobile Editor Max Parker has had some brief hands-on time with the Galaxy S8,\nand got a feel for how the assistant works on the handset, but we’re yet to\ntest out Samsung’s latest software feature in full.\n\nThat said, there are a few things we know about it. Here are the main\nfeatures:\n\nRelated: [Samsung Galaxy S9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-\ngalaxy-s9-release-date-specs-features-price-uk-3266552)\n\n## How does Bixby work?\n\nFirst, the leftmost homescreen is Bixby’s main hub, where it will display\nnews, your steps, your heart rate, suggested YouTube videos and more. The\nassistant will also pop up throughout the S8’s software, offering helpful\nactions and suggestions.\n\n**Bixby in apps**\n\nApps that have been enabled to work with Bixby will be able to make use of the\nassistant, which Samsung says will become capable of supporting almost every\ntask that application includes. The company also promises its new assistant is\na comprehensive tool in this regard, able to carry out many more tasks within\nspecific apps than rival assistants.\n\nNaturally, users will be able to summon and speak to Bixby on command, and\nlike Siri, you can ask it questions and it’ll carry out basic tasks. When\nusing what Samsung is calling a “Bixby-enabled application”, you’ll be able to\nbring up the assistant at any time. The company says it will then understand\nthe current context and state of the app you’re using.\n\n**Related:[Galaxy S8 vs Galaxy\nS7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s8-vs-galaxy-s7)**\n\n![galaxys8\n29](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nWhich apps are actually Bixby-enabled? Well, at launch “a subset of pre-\ninstalled applications” are said to be able to play nice with the new\nassistant. Beyond that, we’re not entirely sure how Bixby will be integrated\ninto other apps, especially those from third-party developers.\n\nSamsung also says “Bixby will allow users to weave various modes of\ninteractions including touch or voice at any context of the application,\nwhichever they feel is most comfortable and intuitive”. Just what this\n“weaving” entails remains a bit of a mystery, but it sounds as though you’ll\nbe able to interact with the assistant in whichever way you like, whether\nthat’s by voice or touch input, without having to worry about Bixby getting\nconfused if you switch between these methods halfway through.\n\nAnd if you’re worried about having to say some awkward activation phrase,\nyou’ll be pleased to hear there’s a dedicated Bixby button on the side of the\nGalaxy S8 and S8+. Pressing this will bring up the assistant so you can take\nadvantage of the AI functionality without announcing it to the world. As\nSamsung explains: “Turning on and unlocking the phone, looking for the phone\napplication, clicking on the contact bar to search for the person that you’re\ntrying to call and pressing the phone icon to start dialling – you will be\nable to do all these steps with one push of the Bixby button and a simple\ncommand.”\n\n![galaxys8\n19](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nPerhaps one of the most interesting features is the new ability to use Bixby\nwith the Galaxy S8’s camera. Samsung has provided a feature whereby you can\nuse the camera to scan an item, then search online for the best price\navailable. We’re yet to test this out, but it sounds like a genuinely\ninnovative addition, even if it is just another excuse to spend money.\n\n**Using Bixby with voice**\n\nSamsung says Bixby won’t get confused if you don’t say the exact phrase\nrequired to activate a particular action. The assistant is said to be smart\nenough to understand incomplete information, and will apparently start a task\neven if it didn’t understand the whole of the command – carrying out the parts\nit did understand and waiting for you to fill in the gaps later with more\ncommands.\n\nSammy also promises “new voice interfaces” to make the whole thing as\nintuitive as possible, so it shouldn’t take long to get used to Bixby’s\nfeatures.\n\n**Bixby in the future**\n\nSamsung says Bixby is just the first part of its plan for AI on smartphones.\nIn the future, the company will be adding more Bixby-enabled apps, before\nreleasing a tool (in SDK) which third-party developers will be able to use to\nmake their applications and services Bixby-enabled.\n\nAnd it won’t just be smartphones that benefit from the evolution of Bixby.\nSamsung has plans to add its new assistant to all its appliances, allowing you\nto “control your air conditioner or TV through Bixby”. It says it will do this\nby using Cloud technology, so that as long as a device has an internet\nconnection and” simple circuitry to receive voice inputs”, it will be able to\nconnect with Bixby. It’s all designed to bring the assistant to every aspect\nof your life, which is precisely what Amazon is trying to do with its Alexa\nassistant and Echo device, and what numerous others, such as Google and Apple\nare working towards\n\nUnfortunately, Samsung’s being a tad cagey on when certain Bixby features will\nbe available in specific regions. The latest information we have is that Bixby\nwill be available on all Samsung S8 smartphones at launch, but its Voice\nfunction will only be available in Korean and US English from May. More\nlanguages will be supported over time, according to the company. Whether UK\nusers will be able to take advantage of all Bixby’s features from May, by\nusing the US English version, remains unclear at this point, but we should\nhear more in the near future.\n\n**Related:[Amazon Echo vs Dot vs\nTap](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/amazon-echo-vs-amazon-dot-vs-amazon-\ntap-difference)**\n\n**Excited to try out Bixby?
