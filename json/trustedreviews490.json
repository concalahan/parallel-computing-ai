Here’s all you need to know, including the HTC Vive Focus release\ndates, specs, design, price, news and more.**\n\n**(Update: October 2, 2017):** _Google’s October event is nearly upon us, and\nit seems Google may be debuting its own headset rather than a new Vive model.\nRead on to find out more._\n\n## HTC Vive Focus: What is the Vive standalone VR headset?\n\nBack in May, Google used its annual I/O 2017 developer conference to announce\n“standalone VR” headsets.\n\nThe idea is that unlike many virtual reality headsets, you won’t need to dock\nin a smartphone or hook it up to a powerful PC. Instead, the headset will\nfunction completely independently, boasting a built-in screen and on-board\ncomputing.\n\nAt the time, Google confirmed HTC as a manufacturing partner, and promised\nthat the device(s) would run on Google’s own [Daydream\nVR](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/daydream-vr-3148686) platform.\n\nThen, in July, Taiwanese VR giant HTC debuted a standalone spin-off to the HTC\nVive virtual reality headset for the Chinese market at Chinajoy 2017. The\ndevice is in the same class as the one announced by Google, but due to issues\nwith Google operating in China, the Chinese version doesn’t have Daydream\nfunctionality.\n\nFast forward to September and HTC has filed trademarks for the name “Vive\nFocus” in both Europe and the USA. Tellingly, these filings are associated\nwith a “head-mounted display”, suggesting that HTC Vive Focus will be the\nfinal name for a new HTC standalone VR headset – although nothing is confirmed\njust yet.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n**Related:[Best VR headset](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/best-vr-\nheadset-2940284)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: HTC\n\n## HTC Vive Focus Release Date: When is the Vive standalone VR headset out?\n\nSo when will the HTC Vive Focus standalone VR headset release date fall? Well,\nat the time of the original announcement, US tech giant Qualcomm – which is\nhelping design the headset hardware – said that the first of these headsets\nwere expected to “hit shelves later this year”.\n\nMeanwhile, HTC put out a blog post that echoed the sentiment in a similarly\nvague fashion: “Vive will be building one of the first standalone headsets for\nthe Daydream platform, to come out later this year.”\n\nGiven how deeply integrated Google is with the headset’s production, we’d\nexpect that the company will be keen to announce the new headset itself.\n\nExcitingly, Google already has a major product launch event scheduled for the\nnear future – it’s happening on October 4, 2017. The event is expected to be\nprimarily used for launching the new Google Pixel 2 smartphone, but we’ve got\nan inkling that we’ll also see the new standalone Daydream headset(s)\nannounced too.\n\nThat theory is lent credence by the fact that HTC recently trademarked the\nname “Vive Focus” in both Europe and the USA, suggesting that devices may be\nnearing the end of development.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: HTC\n\n## HTC Vive Focus Design and Specs: All you need to know\n\nWe’ve yet to receive a significant amount of detail about the HTC Vive Focus\ndesign or specs, but we do have some ideas.\n\nFor instance, HTC has already released an image of the Chinese version of the\nheadset, which is expected to be – for all intents and purposes – identical\napart from the software on-board.\n\nCheck it out:\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: HTC\n\nAnd while HTC handles design, the core technology at the heart of the so-\ncalled HTC Vive Focus will be conjured up by Qualcomm.\n\nGoogle has confirmed that the standalone Daydream VR headset will be powered\nby Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 VR platform. That platform runs on the powerful\n[Snapdragon 835](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/snapdragon-835-phones-\nprocessor-specs-speed-benchmark-chipset-cores-2944086) chip that we’ve already\nseen debuted in the [Samsung Galaxy\nS8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s8), [OnePlus\n5](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/oneplus-5), and [HTC\nU11](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/htc-u11) smartphones.\n\nIn a statement, Keith Kressin, Senior VP of Product Management at Qualcomm,\nsaid: “We are thrilled to once again work with Google and offer a powerful\npremium Snapdragon experience for devices on the Daydream platform.”\n\nHe continued: “Our companies share the same vision: to make it possible for\neveryone to enjoy rich and immersive VR experiences on a smartphone device or\na dedicated VR head-mounted display while being fully mobile, rather than\nbeing restricted by cables or limited to predefined rooms set up for outside-\nin tracking.”\n\nAs Qualcomm is a technology licensing company, it will only be conjuring up\nthe raw headset design, rather than selling headsets directly to consumers.\nHTC will take Qualcomm’s designs and tweak them to create a product that it\ncan ship to consumers, with Google’s Daydream VR on board.\n\n**Related:[PlayStation VR\nreview](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/playstation-vr)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: HTC\n\nSpeaking earlier this year, Google’s VP of virtual reality Clay Bavor said:\n“The Daydream standalone headset reference design created in close partnership\nwith Qualcomm will enable manufacturers to build a whole new category of VR\ndevices.”\n\nBavor went on: “These headsets have everything needed for VR, built right into\nthe headset itself and are as easy to use as picking them up. They’ll feature\nWorldSense for positional tracking right out of the box without any external\nequipment. We’re thrilled that headsets will begin to hit shelves later this\nyear.”\n\nHTC, meanwhile, issued a blog post that said: “We have been working closely\nwith developers and consumers to define the best VR experiences over the past\nfew years, and are perfectly positioned to deliver the most premium standalone\nheadset and user experience.”\n\nThe Taiwanese company – which is currently rumoured to be in line for an\nacquisition by Google – also added that its new headset would provide a\n“deeper and more immersive” portable VR experience than ever before, and that\nit will be simple, easy-to-use, and will have no cables to connect: “Just pick\nit up, put it on and be fully immersed in your new reality.”\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: HTC\n\n## HTC Vive Focus Price: How much will the Vive standalone VR headset cost?\n\nIt’s tricky to say how much the HTC Vive Focus will cost, given the lack of\nrumours on the matter.\n\nIn the UK, it currently costs £599.99 to buy a HTC Vive, and that’s not even\ncounting in the price of the gaming PC you’ll need to power it.\n\nMeanwhile, lower end VR headsets like the [Samsung Gear\nVR](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-gear-vr) cost £99 to buy\nstraight out, but you’ll also need a Samsung smartphone to dock inside the\nheadset.\n\nGiven that the standalone VR headset will need to feature full Google Daydream\n(based on Android), run on a Snapdragon 835-based platform, sport a very\npixel-dense, high-quality display, and come with a raft of sensors built in,\nwe’d expect it to cost a similar price to a smartphone.\n\nIf we were to take a guess, we’d pin the price at somewhere between £249 and\n£499, although it’s tough to say exactly where Google and HTC will be aiming\ntheir headset.\n\nAlthough high-end headsets like the HTC Vive and [Oculus\nRift](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/oculus-rift) have seen some\nsuccess, Google and HTC will need to ensure the price of the new headset is\nlow enough to attract consumers beyond gadget enthusiasts and early adopters.\n\n**Related:[HTC Vive vs Oculus\nRift](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/oculus-rift-vs-htc-\nvive-2934282)**\n\n**What’s your take on the virtual reality revolution?
