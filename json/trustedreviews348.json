It’s 50kg lighter than its\npredecessor, starts at £110,000, and will only be available to 999 customers\nglobally.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: Audi\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThe German carmaker also showed off its vision for the future of driving in\nthe form of the Audi Aicon. A somewhat wacky concept car, the Aicon has no\npedals or steering wheel, instead carting round passengers in fully autonomous\nfashion.\n\nAudi hopes that one day, rich people will sit in the back of the Aicon and\nenjoy luxury comforts, like hi-res movies and chairs that can move around the\nback of your car. Fancy, eh?\n\n> Some more shots of the driverless Aicon concept by\n[@Audi](https://twitter.com/Audi) at\n[#IAA2017](https://twitter.com/hashtag/IAA2017?src=hash)\n[pic.twitter.com/4yQ810fEg9](https://t.co/4yQ810fEg9)\n\n>\n\n> — Sean Keach (@SeanKeach) [September 12,\n2017](https://twitter.com/SeanKeach/status/907600061353394176)\n\n### Bentley at IAA 2017\n\nBentley used the IAA 2017 motor show to finally debut its all-new Bentley\nContinental GT. The third-generation grand tourer replaces the old model,\nwhich ran/runs from 2011 to 2018.\n\nWe’ve not got pricing yet, but we’re expecting the new car to arrive on\ndriveways in the UK in the first quarter of 2018.\n\n> The new Bentley Continental GT, coming to huge driveways in leafy Surrey\ncirca Q1 2018 [#IAA2017](https://twitter.com/hashtag/IAA2017?src=hash)\n[pic.twitter.com/Q5qbADyTmQ](https://t.co/Q5qbADyTmQ)\n\n>\n\n> — Sean Keach (@SeanKeach) [September 12,\n2017](https://twitter.com/SeanKeach/status/907601763431272453)\n\nIn a statement, Bentley CEO Wolfgang Dürheimer described the car as a\n“defining moment” for Bentley Motors. It’s easy to see why; the meaty tourer\ncan output an impressive 626bhp, and promises a 0-60mph time of 3.6 seconds,\nas well as a top speed of 207mph.\n\n### BMW at IAA 2017\n\nBMW managed to secure plenty of hype around its new concept car, the BMW i\nVision Dynamics.\n\nFormally debuted at the Frankfurt Motor Show, the BMW i Vision Dynamics is an\nall-electric vehicle that sits between the existing BMW i3 and BMW i8.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: BMW\n\nIt boasts a range of 600km (373 miles), manages a nippy top speed of over\n200kmh (120mph), and can accelerate from zero to 100kmh (62mph) in just four\nseconds. Unfortunately, there’s no word on when (or even if) this car will\nbecome a production model, so exercise patience for now.\n\n### Bugatti at IAA 2017\n\nThe Bugatti stand was drawing plenty of attention at the Frankfurt Motor Show,\nlargely on account of the Bugatti Chiron stationed there.\n\nIf you missed the hype, here’s the deal: this vehicle set the production car\nrecord for accelerating from zero right up to 249mph (400kmh) and then back to\nzero again. It managed that impressive feat in just 42 seconds, which is\nprobably quicker than the time it took me to write these two paragraphs.\n\n> The Bugatti Chiron, which set the production car record for 0-249mph\n(400kmh) acceleration (and back to zero, too) – 42 seconds, yeah 😮\n[pic.twitter.com/oJ1KSYYLsJ](https://t.co/oJ1KSYYLsJ)\n\n>\n\n> — Sean Keach (@SeanKeach) [September 12,\n2017](https://twitter.com/SeanKeach/status/907602724233064448)\n\n### Disney at IAA 2017\n\n“What?!” I hear you cry, “why is Disney there?” It’s a fair question, because\nDisney doesn’t even make cars. But it does make _Cars_.\n\nAnd it turns out that the Cars it does make, are made from cars themselves.\nCar-ception, if you will:\n\n> In the future, all cars will be made from…cars\n[#IAA2017](https://twitter.com/hashtag/IAA2017?src=hash)\n[pic.twitter.com/PMZcHHOJjl](https://t.co/PMZcHHOJjl)\n\n>\n\n> — Sean Keach (@SeanKeach) [September 12,\n2017](https://twitter.com/SeanKeach/status/907607694621757440)\n\n### Jaguar at IAA 2017\n\nJaguar’s big announcement at IAA 2017 was the Jaguar eTrophy, a new all-\nelectric race series to support the core FIA Formula E championship. Described\nas the “world’s first international championship for production-based electric\ncars”, the eTrophy series is set to begin in late 2018.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: Jaguar\n\nAlongside this announcement, Jaguar also revealed that it would be creating\nits own race car, based on the design of the upcoming electric Jaguar I-Pace.\nThe modified motor will be dubbed Jaguar I-Pace eTrophy, and is being\ndeveloped by Jaguar’s secretive Special Vehicle Operations unit in the UK.\n\n### Land Rover at IAA 2017\n\nThe Land Rover Discovery SVX is the headline news from Land Rover at this\nyear’s Frankfurt Motor Show.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)Credit: Jaguar Land Rover\n\nIt’s described as the “pinnacle of the Discovery family”, and is basically the\nmost extreme version of a Land Rover we’ve ever seen. With a huge 525hp\n5.0-litre supercharged V8 petrol powertrain, gargantuan 815mm all-terrain\ntyres, and a ground clearance that trumps even the new Land Rover Discovery\n2017, this is a force to be reckoned with.\n\nBetter still, it was developed by the Special Vehicle Operations team that\nbrought us the 200mph Jaguar F-Type SVR, and the same minds who are developing\nthe electric Jaguar I-Pace eTrophy race car (also announced at IAA 2017).\n\n> New Land Rover Discovery SVX built by Jag's Special Vehicle Operations team.\n525hp 5L V8 petrol engine, 815mm all-terrain tyres 😍\n[#IAA2017](https://twitter.com/hashtag/IAA2017?src=hash)\n[pic.twitter.com/0d1EhD95jk](https://t.co/0d1EhD95jk)\n\n>\n\n> — Sean Keach (@SeanKeach) [September 12,\n2017](https://twitter.com/SeanKeach/status/907611412167524353)\n\n### Porsche at IAA 2017\n\nAnyone swinging by the Porsche stand at this year’s Frankfurt motor show will\nbe able to catch a glimpse of the new 680hp Porsche Panamera Turbo S E-Hybrid\nExecutive, which is seriously long.\n\nIt can manage zero to 100kmh (62mph) in just 3.5 seconds, and boasts a racy\ntop speed of 310kmh (192mph). Oh, and it looks like this:\n\n> The 680hp Porsche Panamera Turbo S E-Hybrid Executive is super long.

This means it’s possible to charge an electric car\nwhile you drive along the road, without ever having to plug in your car. It\ncould also be a major boon to taxi ranks and bus stops in UK cities.\n\n> Qualcomm has developed a wireless system that lets the road charge your\nelectric car as you drive [#DEVC](https://twitter.com/hashtag/DEVC?src=hash)\n[#IAA2017](https://twitter.com/hashtag/IAA2017?src=hash)\n[@Qualcomm_UK](https://twitter.com/Qualcomm_UK)\n[pic.twitter.com/gPWBXeaQuP](https://t.co/gPWBXeaQuP)\n\n>\n\n> — Sean Keach (@SeanKeach) [September 13,\n2017](https://twitter.com/SeanKeach/status/907910208491487232)\n\nSadly, it’s just a concept for now, but a Qualcomm spokesperson told _Trusted\nReviews_ that we could see such technology rolled out in as few as 10 to 15\nyears.\n\n### Renault at IAA 2017\n\nRenault’s big launch at the Frankfurt Motor Show was the new Mégane RS, which\nis a new version of the standard Mégane, albeit with boosted performance.\n\nThis fierce hot hatch rocks four-wheel steering, an all-new 280hp engine with\n390Nm of torque, and an 11% efficiency improvement compared to the previous\ngeneration.\n\nHere’s a peek:\n\n> The new Renault Megane RS is yet more evidence that Renault is smashing\ndesign across all models\n[#IAA2017](https://twitter.com/hashtag/IAA2017?src=hash)\n[pic.twitter.com/ypZcsDOtfs](https://t.co/ypZcsDOtfs)\n\n>\n\n> — Sean Keach (@SeanKeach) [September 14,\n2017](https://twitter.com/SeanKeach/status/908246136556748800)\n\nThe real eye-grabber at Renault’s IAA 2017 stand, however, was the Renault\nSymbioz concept. It’s supposed to showcase Renault’s vision of the car of the\nfuture, and looks undeniably space-age.\n\nThe car, which is what Renault reckons vehicles might look like in 2030, is\nfully electric and autonomous, and connected to the environment around it. It\nwon’t carry drivers, of course, but “travellers” who will “enjoy a cabin that\nfeels like home”.\n\n> Renault's Symbioz concept looks like something the Pope will ride around in\ncirca 2055 [#IAA2017](https://twitter.com/hashtag/IAA2017?src=hash)\n[pic.twitter.com/PVF9MikTXL](https://t.co/PVF9MikTXL)\n\n>\n\n> — Sean Keach (@SeanKeach) [September 14,\n2017](https://twitter.com/SeanKeach/status/908246724438880256)\n\n### Roborace at IAA 2017\n\nIn a surprise announcement, the long-awaited Roborace autonomous motorsport\nchampionship announced Lucas di Grassi as its CEO.\n\nThe Brazilian racer is a world champion of electric car race series Formula E,\nthanks to a first-place finish in the third (and most recent) season of the\nseries. He’s also spent a year advising Roborace, so he’s not entirely new to\nthe company.\n\n> NEWS: [@FIAformulaE](https://twitter.com/FIAformulaE) Champion\n[@LucasdiGrassi](https://twitter.com/LucasdiGrassi) joins Roborace as CEO!\nWatch our exclusive video with him on the future of Roborace\n[#WelcomeLucas](https://twitter.com/hashtag/WelcomeLucas?src=hash)\n[pic.twitter.com/UqML8Jxkge](https://t.co/UqML8Jxkge)\n\n>\n\n> — Roborace (@roborace) [September 13,\n2017](https://twitter.com/roborace/status/907923835156021248)\n\nIn a statement, di Grassi said: “We want to take Roborace where motorsport\ncannot go, focusing the platform on road-relevant autonomous technology. The\nfuture of mobility is autonomous, that’s an industry consensus now.”\n\nHe continued: “In the same way, I believe that motorsport is about the driver,\nwho is the best human being behind the wheel. I want to develop the Roborace\nseries to be complimentary to traditional motorsport, and not to replace it.”\n\n### Skoda at IAA 2017\n\nFollowing a brief showing in Shanghai earlier this year, the all-electric\nSkoda Vision E concept made a proper European debut at Frankfurt’s motor show.\n\nThe design has been refined a little since Shanghai, but it’s still similarly\nspace-age – especially on the inside.\n\nCheck it out:\n\n> The all-electric Skoda Vision E concept gets a revised look at\n[#IAA2017](https://twitter.com/hashtag/IAA2017?src=hash), but not convinced by\nthe bogey yellow paintjob\n[pic.twitter.com/lRw9P13yP7](https://t.co/lRw9P13yP7)\n\n>\n\n> — Sean Keach (@SeanKeach) [September 12,\n2017](https://twitter.com/SeanKeach/status/907606265941118977)\n\n**Related:[New Audi A8 2017](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/new-\naudi-a8-3d-sound-system-3268759)**\n\n## IAA 2017 Dates: When is the Frankfurt Motor Show?\n\nThe IAA 2017 is officially held between September 14 and September 24 this\nyear, but most of the announcements will had already happened by the time the\nshow began proper.\n\nThat’s because the press days take place before the show actually opens, with\nmajor press conferences falling on September 12 and 13.\n\n## IAA 2017 Press Conference Schedule: All the key times\n\nHere are the key press conferences from this year’s Frankfurt Motor Show:\n\n### Tuesday\n\n  * 08:30 – 09:15: BMW Group\n  * 08:50 – 09:05: Toyota\n  * 09:00: Lexus\n  * 09:10 – 09:25: Opel\n  * 09:30 – 09:45: Subaru\n  * 09:35 – 09:50: Mercedes-Benz\n  * 09:50 – 10:05: Renault\n  * 09:50 – 10:05: Smart\n  * 10:05 – 10:20: AMG\n  * 10:30 – 10:45: Volkswagen\n  * 10:45 – 11:00: Audi\n  * 11:15 – 11:30: Lamborghini\n  * 11:30 – 11:45: Porsche\n  * 11:45 – 12:00: Bentley\n  * 11:50 – 12:05: Jaguar\n  * 12:05 – 12:20: Land Rover\n  * 12:15 – 12:30: Seat\n  * 12:30 – 12:45: Bugatti\n  * 12:50 – 13:05: Disney\n  * 12:55 – 13:10: Hyundai\n  * 13:00 – 13:15: Suzuki\n  * 13:00 – 13:15: Maserati\n  * 13:15 – 13:30: Ferrari\n  * 13:20 – 13:35: Honda\n  * 13:40 – 13:55: Kia\n  * 14:20 – 14:35: SsangYong\n  * 16:00 – 16:15: BMW Motorsport\n\n### Wednesday\n\n  * 08:30 – 08:55: Michelin\n  * 13:05 – 13:30: Roborace\n  * 16:30 – 16:55: Segway\n\n**Related:[Range Rover Velar](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/range-rover-\nvelar-2017-price-release-date-specs-features-preview-3068648)**\n\n**Tell us your IAA 2017 highlights via Facebook or Twitter.**\n\n"}
