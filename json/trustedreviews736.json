You're limited to just four people though, so this might not\nreplace your business conferencing software of choice just yet.\n\nThe feature has been in limited testing for a little while now, and although\nthe global release is now underway, the update might still take a little bit\nof time to reach your device.\n\n**Read more:[Best smartphone](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nsmartphone-3431175)**\n\nIn a [blog post](https://blog.whatsapp.com/10000646/Group-Calling-for-Voice-\nand-Video-Is-Here) announcing the the rollout, WhatsApp has said that video\ncalls benefit from the same end-to-end encryption as messages.\n\nYou start a group video chat by opening a regular one-on-one conversation and\nadding new participants via the ‘add participant’ button at the top right of\nthe screen.\n\nIt would be great to see a slicker integration with existing WhatsApp groups\nto immediately turn them into video calls, but with so many chats featuring\nmore than four participants this might not be technically feasible.\n\n## WhatsApp vs FaceTime, Skype, and Google Hangouts\n\nWith the rollout of group video chats, WhatsApp joins a growing number of\nother apps that offer the same functionality. At WWDC earlier this year, Apple\nannounced that it is adding group video chats for up to 32 people, and Skype\nand Google Hangouts already support group chats for up to 25 participants.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nIn this context, WhatsApp’s four-person limit seems a little low, but\nconsidering it’s a mobile app rather than desktop video conferencing software,\nthis isn’t entirely unexpected.\n\n**Read more:[Best VPN](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-vpn-3470328)**\n\nAdditionally, in our experience we’ve tended to find that network latency is\nthe biggest limiting factor for massive Google Hangouts calls, rather than the\nhard 25-participant limit.\n\n**How big do you think a video conference can get before it becomes too much?\nLet us know @TrustedReviews.**\n\n"}
