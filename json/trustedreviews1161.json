These two new structures show the potential of the tech.**\n\nThe first is a mansion made completely by 3D printing. It spans 1,100 square\nmetres and stands three storeys tall, with a balcony complete with balustrade\nand banisters. Admittedly it’s not quite so pretty on the inside, but it’s\nmore a demonstration of what’s possible.\n\nThe second is a five-storey apartment block. It’s not quite as attractive, but\nagain, it’s pretty amazing considering it was all printed.\n\nBoth were made by Winsun, the Chinese company that has previously made basic\nhomes using a 3D printer. These are its most ambitious projects yet. They’re\nboth proof-of-concept homes for now, positioned side-by-side in an expo area\nin Suzhou, eastern China, [Tech In Asia\nreports](https://www.techinasia.com/china-3d-printed-mansion-and-tower-\nblock/). But it might not be long before people are living in such structures.\n\nThey were made by printing multiple layers of concrete that form pre-\nfabricated walls that are then moved into place.\n\n**Read more:** [Red Bull Racing: 3D printing is the future of\nF1](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/red-bull-racing-3d-printing-is-the-\nfuture-of-f1)\n\nWe’ve seen plenty of novelty items made using 3D printers, but these are the\nbest demonstrations yet that they could be put to good use.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThere has been a glut of [more affordable 3D\nprinters](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/sculptify-david-\nmakes-3d-printing-more-affordable) on crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter and\nIndiegogo recently, so let’s hope the prices continue to fall.
