Given that device offered a 12-megapixel primary camera spec similar\n(but not identical) to Samsung’s 2017 flagships, it wouldn’t be a surprise to\nsee the W2019 come with two 12-megapixel rear sensors, as dual camera setups\nare now very much in vogue.\n\nAn upgraded 8-megapixel front ‘selfie cam’ has also been mooted, but as ever,\nthese specs are purely conjuncture at this stage – we hope to learn more soon.\n\nOne final thing to note is that last year’s Samsung flip phone wasn’t overly\naffordable. Its price cleared the £1000 mark when converted from yuan, meaning\nyou could likely bag a [Galaxy\nS9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9) or [iPhone\nXS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xs) for a similar outlay.\nPlus, the W20118 only appears to have been released in China, so you might not\nbe able to buy one, even if you wanted to.\n\nStill, Samsung’s next premium flip phone could well offer some clues as to\nwhat to expect from its next mainstream releases, so we’re intrigued.\n\nWatch this space.\n\n**Should Samsung release a premium flip phone in the UK?
