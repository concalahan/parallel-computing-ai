However, given the issuesin 2017, it’s concerning that nailing this feature wasn’t a priority for thePixel 3 launch.The issue also appears to be slightly different this time around. The Pixel 2XL audio recording in video mode appeared to be high pitched and distorted,until it was fixed by a Google software update. It’s also strange that theGoogle phones are being plagued by such an issue given the quality of thecameras is one of the Pixel range’s main selling points.Ortega points out: “If Google doesn’t get this audio/microphone recordingfixed, this is going to be a problem. If you’re big into video and it’s apriority, I’d hold off on the Pixel 3 until we get an update.”**Have you noticed any issues with the Pixel 3 or Pixel 3 XL since you pickedup the handsets?
