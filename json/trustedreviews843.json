The first–the [NUCLUN](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-confirms-own-nuclun-cpu-and-first-phone-to-be-powered-by-it) – actually landed on the LG G3 Screen,and didn’t go down too well.The second was intended to be a direct [Snapdragon810](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/snapdragon-810-features) rival,and would feature four Cortex-A57 cores and four Cortex-A53 cores. This wasscrapped apparently, however, due to technical issues.It’s worth noting that ARM’s Cortex-A72 processor is destined for 2016smartphones, so we probably won’t see LG’s chip offering in any of this year’shandsets at least.LG will likely stick with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon chips for its 2015 flagships,with the [LG G Flex 2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/lg-g-flex-2-review)already confirmed to be carrying the Snapdragon 810."}
