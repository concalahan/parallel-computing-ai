Unfortunately, it has emerged, that accessory disables a\nmajor feature on Google’s new handsets.**\n\nAn [Android Police](https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/11/02/pixel-stand-\nbreaks-ambient-display-notifications-pixel-3/) tipster says the upright\ncharging pad breaks the optional ambient notifications settings, which wake\nthe phone when an alert comes through.\n\nWhile the feature will still vibrate or sound a tone, the display will remain\ninactive, according to the report. While this may not be a huge deal for some\nusers, others who rely on ambient notifications could miss important\ninformation while using the Pixel Stand.\n\nGoogle confirmed to the site it is looking into the flaw, which was\nindependently corroborated by Android. It’s not clear whether the problem\nexists when using third-party wireless chargers too.\n\n**Related:[Pixel 3 vs Pixel 3\nXL](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/pixel-3-vs-pixel-3-xl-3601343)**\n\nThe report says the only way to return to normal behaviour is to reboot the\nphone. However, placing the handset back on the Pixel Slate breaks the feature\nall over again.\n\nAs was previously mentioned, the Pixel Stand is the only way to wirelessly\ncharge the new handsets at 10W. Third-party wireless charger will only\nreplenish a Pixel 3 handset at the slower speed of 5W.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nGoogle says this is because the connection relies on a secure handshake to\ncharge the device at 10W, which third-party chargers cannot provide. However,\nit is working on resolving this with devices in the Made for Google program.\n\n**Related:[Best wireless chargers](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nwireless-charger-3505891)**\n\nA Google spokesperson told _Trusted Reviews_ : “We don’t limit third-party\ndevices, in fact, we’re working with our partners in the Made for Google\nprogram to get fast 10W chargers certified for use with Pixel 3 (Belkin\nannounced its 10W Pixel 3 charger already which will launch in the coming\nweeks). Pixel Stand and Pixel 3 work together through the protocol we’ve\ndeveloped for fast charging. Everything else charges at the industry standard\nQi 5W.”\n\nThe latest issue is another hiccup for the Pixel 3 range, since it went on\nsale last month. Audio recording in videos is poor, while the handset recently\nbegan showing a random display notch on the side of the phone.\n\n**Have you experienced any issues since your Google Pixel 3 since picking up\nthe handset?
