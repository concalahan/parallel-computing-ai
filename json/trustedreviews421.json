From the EU and UK government to the\nlikes of Sky, the Premier League, Amazon, Facebook and eBay, it seems that\neverybody has attempted to stop the spread of so-called “fully loaded” Kodi\nboxes over recent months.**\n\nRewind to April 2016 and Kodi was still a relatively niche media streaming\nplatform, loved by home theatre PC enthusiasts and cord cutters, but still\nlargely a mystery to the masses. Everything changed in 2017, when people\nrealised that − used in a certain (read “illegal”) way − it could help them\naccess TV shows, films and live sports for free.\n\nSo what is Kodi and is it legal? Here’s what you need to know before you start\nusing Kodi, including major developments and court cases.\n\n**Related:[Best VPN](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-vpn-3470328)**\n\n## Kodi in the news\n\nIn September, researchers from cybersecurity firm ESET\n[discovered](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/09/13/kodi-add-ons-launch-\ncryptomining-campaign/) that several infected third-party Kodi addons found on\nthe Bubbles, Gaia and XvBMC repositories were secretly mining the\ncryptocurrency Monero with the help of unsuspecting Kodi users’ processing\npower.\n\nThe malware affects Windows and Linux users, the researchers say, and the UK\nhas been found to be one of the top five countries affected by the threat.\n\nAll three repositories appear to be offline at the time of publication,\n“however, unwitting victims who have the cryptominer installed on their\ndevices are likely still affected. On top of that, the malware is still\npresent in other repositories and some ready-made Kodi builds, most likely\nwithout the knowledge of their authors,” ESET says.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n![kodi](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nImage Credit: Kodi\n\n## Kodi, addons and boxes\n\nKodi is free, open-source software developed by the not-for-profit\norganisation XBMC Foundation. It’s an entertainment hub that lets you play\nvideos, music, podcasts and other types of content from the web and local or\nnetwork storage.\n\nIt’s available on devices running Linux, macOS, Windows, iOS and Android, and\ncan be accessed on a variety of hardware, including smartphones, tablets,\nmedia players, computers and TVs.\n\nThe XBMC Foundation recently launched the second beta build of its upcoming\nv18 Leia release. It will bring big improvements for how the player handles\nmusic libraries, live TV (thanks to support for USB tuners), support for game\nemulators and controllers, and even support for generic DRM. Perhaps the most\ninteresting new development is the work the team has been doing to get the\nplayer into a usable state as an [Xbox\nOne](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/xbox-one) app.\n\nThe final version of [Kodi v18 Leia](https://kodi.tv/article/kodi-v18-leia-\nbeta-1) is expected to land later this year, but you can get your hands on the\nsoftware’s upcoming tweaks and enhancements early by downloading it\n[here](https://kodi.tv/download). However, as the foundation itself warns, if\nyou decide to give it a try, create a backup first.\n\n“Since we now started the Beta cycle a final release will be on the near\nhorizon. When the final release will actually be is yet unknown as it all\ndepends on the stability now more people will start using the v18 builds,” the\nXBMC Foundation wrote in a [blog post](https://kodi.tv/article/kodi-v18-leia-\nbeta-2) in September.\n\nKodi is legal. However, one of the reasons it’s become so popular over recent\nyears is the fact that you can use it to stream TV shows, films and live\nsports for free.\n\nTo use the software this way, you also need to install specific piracy-\nconfigured addons, created by third-party developers. Such addons are designed\nto help users break the law and, as such, they’re illegal.\n\nFurthermore, since the process of tracking down and installing specific addons\nisn’t completely straightforward, there’s heavy demand for cheap media players\nthat have already been pre-loaded with Kodi and a selection of reliable\npiracy-configured addons.\n\nThese devices have come to be known as “fully loaded” boxes, and they’ve\nproven rather troublesome for broadcasters, studios and the government,\nlargely because they’re cheap, readily available and extremely easy to use.\n\n**Read more:[Best 4K TVs](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-4k-tvs)**\n\n## Kodi box crackdown\n\nIn April 2017, the European Court of Justice\n[ruled](https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2017-04/cp170040en.pdf)\nthat the sale of Kodi boxes was illegal, as was the use of a media player to\nstream copyrighted content without the consent of the copyright holder.\nPreviously, it was only against the law to download the content.\n\nSince then, UK courts have seen plenty of Kodi-related action. These are some\nof the most high-profile cases we’ve had so far:\n\n  * In October 2017, Kodi box seller Brian Thompson was handed an 18-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, after pleading guilty to selling and advertising devices “designed, produced or adapted for the purpose of enabling or facilitating the circumvention of effective technological measures”. In May 2018, however, he was fined just £1 by the courts, after it emerged that he had no significant assets to confiscate, despite pocketing £38,500 from selling the devices.\n  * In July 2018, two men were handed suspended prison sentences after being caught selling Kodi boxes under the name Oobersticks. One of the men, Glenn Burrows, was sentenced to 22 months behind bars, with the other, Darren Wicks, receiving a 20-month sentence. Interestingly, they appear to have attempted to avoid prosecution by supplying the boxes only partially configured, so their customers would have to complete the final stage of configuration themselves. However, the tactic didn’t save them.\n  * Also in July 2018, Kodi box seller John Haggerty, who managed to flog more than 8000 Infusum boxes between March 2013 and July 2015, making over £750,000 in the process, was jailed for five years and three months. His wife, Mary Gilfillan, was handed a two-year suspended sentence for fraud.\n  * In August 2018, Kodi box seller Warren Gleave from Burnley was sentenced to 16 months behind bars, [according to](https://torrentfreak.com/pirate-tv-box-seller-sentenced-to-16-months-in-jail-180820/) TorrentFreak. Gleave, who’s believed to have earned more than £200,000 selling the illegal devices online over a period of three years, pleaded guilty to committing offenses under the Fraud Act 2006, after being investigated by Sky.\n\n## Major Kodi developments\n\nMajor online platforms including Amazon, Facebook and eBay banned the sale of\n“fully loaded” boxes on their websites in 2017, though investigations have\nfound that they’re still quite easy to track down. Sellers have been dodging\nthe bans simply by misspelling keywords, such as the names of legitimate\ncontent providers, in product listings. Think ‘eyepeetv’ boxes that let you\nwatch ‘Sly’ and ‘Virmin’ Media for free.\n\n“eBay, Facebook and Amazon have banned the sale of these devices, but\ncriminals are beating the system by purposely misspelling brand names − we\nneed to see tighter controls in place to help stop the sale of these devices,”\nKieron Sharp, the CEO of the Federation Against Copyright Theft, told _Trusted\nReviews_.\n\nFacebook went a step further in August 2018, by banning the sale of any device\nthat comes with “Kodi installed”, even if they’ve not been pre-loaded with\npiracy-configured addons. The [prohibited\ncontent](https://m.facebook.com/policies/commerce/prohibited_content/unauthorized_access_to_digital_media_or_interference_with_electronic_devices)\nsection of the social network’s commerce policies, however, adds that “add-on\nequipment for Kodi devices such as keyboards and remotes” are permitted.\n\nPopular addon library site TVAddons − which has clashed very publicly with the\nXBMC Foundation in the past − became embroiled in a lawsuit in the US in 2017,\nwhere it was accused of copyright infringement.\n\nThe move prompted the site to delist a multitude of popular piracy-configured\naddons, including the extremely popular Exodus and Covenant addons, both of\nwhich can provide free and illegal access to a huge selection of TV shows and\nfilms. You can browse TVAddons’ updated list of blacklisted Kodi addons\n[here](https://www.tvaddons.co/kodi-addons-blacklisted/).\n\n“We are no longer indexing certain types of addons as a result of legal\npressure. This doesn’t mean that you can’t install whatever you’d like, it\njust means that we can’t index those addons through our platform,” TVAddons\n[announced](https://www.tvaddons.co/kodi-addons-working/) in April 2018.\n“Right now we’re only indexing Kodi addons from which content licensing can be\n‘easily’ verified. We’re not saying anyone else is bad, we just can’t be part\nof it.”\n\nThe Intellectual Property Office’s (IPO) 2018 Online Copyright Infringement\nTracker report indicates that the crackdown on illegal boxes and addons might\nbe working. For the report, 2890 people (based in the UK and aged 12 and\nolder) who have consumed or shared content in the past three months were asked\nwhich service they used, and [the\nresponses](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-copyright-\ninfringement-tracker-survey-8th-wave) suggested that fewer people are using\nKodi in 2018 (6%) than there were in 2017 (7%).\n\nThat said, cybersecurity firm Irdeto\n[revealed](https://resources.irdeto.com/infographics/infographic-giving-\npiracy-a-red-card) in May 2018 that it detected 5100 illegal streams showing\nlast season’s Champions League knockout games. They reached 4,893,902 viewers.\n2121 of these streams were found on dedicated pirate websites, with another\n2093 detected across social media channels, and a comparatively low 886\nstreams found through illicit Kodi addons.\n\n“The number of Kodi streams being lower than other channels … could be a\nresult of the recent actions around illegal boxes and increased awareness of\nthe risks of illegal addons,” Irdeto told _Trusted Reviews_.\n\nIt also dug up 427 illegal streams redistributing the Champions League final\nbetween Liverpool and Real Madrid. Of these, 133 were available on dedicated\npirate sites, 199 were found on social media platforms including Periscope,\nFacebook and Twitch, and 95 were available through illicit Kodi addons.\n\nThe Premier League is keen to step up Kodi crackdown efforts, with its\nexecutive director William Bush recently criticising proponents of Kodi and\neven VPNs. “Promoting circumventions of the law should be discouraged and\nminimised,” he said. “I’m not saying it can be eliminated, but to have\nwebsites which show you how to break the law, have social media supply content\nwhich shows you how to break the law, everything from Kodi boxes to how to get\na VPN to circumvent paying subscriptions … they should be discouraged.”\n\nIn July 2018, the High Court renewed an injunction allowing the Premier League\nto block live streams of games in the UK. It covers the entire 2018/19 Premier\nLeague season, and requires UK internet service providers to set about\nblocking the streams in real time.\n\nThe Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) has also called for tougher\ncriminal sentences to be handed to users and sellers of illicit streaming\ndevices, as well as creators of illegal Kodi addons.\n\n“While the civil suits brought by the private sector are impactful, criminal\nactions by the federal government have a larger deterrent value, and thus\nwould be even more effective at mitigating the problem,” it\n[wrote](https://www.mpaa.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/180717-MPAA-response-\nto-NTIA-internet-priorities-inquiry.pdf) in July 2018.\n\n“Although not a streaming device case, the federal government’s criminal\naction against Megaupload, then the largest piracy “cyberlocker,” accounting\nfor 4 percent of all Internet traffic, prompted many other pirate operations\nto shutter, and resulted in an 6.5 to 8.5 percent increase in digital sales\nfor three major studios in 12 countries. We would expect similar results were\nthe government to become more active in the fight against streaming devices.”\n\n![orion\nkodi](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Kodi, Gaia and Orion\n\nTVAddons recently issued a warning about a feature called Orion, which is\ndesigned to help other addons work more smoothly.\n\nOrion [describes itself](https://orionoid.com/) as: “A service that indexes\nmetadata and links from a variety of public websites and networks, including\ntorrent, usenet, and hoster indexes. Big search engines like Google and Bing\nhave web crawlers that search through the code of websites to extract\ninformation, links, and other useful data.\n\n“Orion operates in a similar fashion to these search engines, but it is a\ndistributed system maintained by the community … If one user conducts a\nsearch, the results are cached on Orion’s servers, allowing subsequent users\nto retrieve those results instead of having to redo the entire scraping\nprocess.\n\n“This is especially useful for users with slow devices or those who simply do\nnot want to wait for the lengthy scraping procedure. Orion does not create,\nstore, or distribute any files whatsoever, but only caches textual metadata to\nassist users in the search process.”\n\nIt comes with a popular Kodi addon called Gaia, and TVAddons says it’s\nconcerned that the way it works could get land Gaia users in trouble.\n\n“Users signing up for the free service are doing so in hopes that they’ll find\nthe latest episode of their favourite TV show, and not realizing the potential\nrisks. Until now, we have not heard of any case of Kodi end users being sued\nfor copyright infringement … because until now, Kodi addons have been mostly\nused to scrape external web sites from which the addon developers have no\nassociation. Users were never ‘contributing’ to piracy, but merely ‘leeching’\ncontent,” TVAddons wrote in a [blog\npost](https://betanews.com/2018/08/19/popular-kodi-add-on-phones-home/).\n\nIt continues: “The worry is that by having end users automatically contribute\nlinks they scrape to the Orion database, they could be considered distributors\nunder the law. This could open certain regular Kodi users to significant\nliability, possibly fines in the tens of thousands.”\n\nTVAddons believes that “thousands of unsuspecting Kodi users” could be using\nOrion, and says it hopes that the team behind the service “will at least make\nthe risks more clear” upfront.\n\n“If you are accessing content for free such as sport, TV and films for which\nyou’d normally need a subscription, or go to the cinema, or buy a DVD, this is\nillegal and these addons have made it incredibly easy for consumers to access\nillegal content,” Kieron Sharp, the CEO of FACT, told _Trusted Reviews_.\n\n“The fact that users are now at further risk due to Gaia’s new feature pasting\nuser links into its own database should not be a surprise; if you choose to\nillegally stream you must realise the risks you face by putting your sensitive\ninformation into the hands of criminals. In addition to the technical dangers,\nthere could be severe financial and legal consequences if consumers stream\nillegal material.”\n\n**Read more:[Netflix vs Amazon Prime Instant\nVideo](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/netflix-vs-amazon-prime-instant-\nvideo-2918310)**\n\n## Kodi Primer: What to do and what not to do\n\nHere are some basic pointers on using the popular platform:\n\n  * Do feel free to check out the software. It’s a great platform and the software is not illegal in any way.\n  * Don’t buy a so-called “fully loaded” box − they’re illegal.\n  * Do also check out addons – most are legal and Kodi’s official repository highlights some of the best.\n  * Don’t bother going crying to the XBMC Foundation if a dodgy addon stops working. It’s simply not interested and won’t provide you with tech support.\n\n**Do you think the anti-piracy crackdown is working? Share your thoughts with\nus on Twitter @TrustedReviews.**\n\n"}
