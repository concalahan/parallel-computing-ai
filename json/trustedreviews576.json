However, its new Nokia Sleep sensor is far more\ndiscreet, which might prove beneficial for the many people who don’t like\nwearing things on their wrist overnight.\n\nThe Nokia Sleep takes the form of a Wi-Fi-connected sensor that’s designed to\ndiscreetly slip under your mattress. It uses movement to detect your sleep\npattern, while also monitoring for snoring. It isn’t the first of this type of\ndevice to work this way; devices such as the Beddit took a similar approach.\n\nThe Sleep is promising to deliver sleep cycle recognition, letting you know\nhow much time is spent in the deep, light and REM stages of sleep. It will\nalso provide a sleep score to give you an idea of the actual restorative\nquality of a particular night’s kip.\n\nNokia says that it has worked with sleep specialist Dr Christopher Winter MD,\nfrom the Charlottesville Neurology and Sleep Medicine Clinic, to develop a\nSleep Smarter program in the Health Mate app. Users can apparently increase\ntheir sleep by 12 minutes a night with small changes to behaviour and routine.\nIt doesn’t really sound like much, but for anyone familiar with the ‘snooze’\nbutton on their alarm, 12 minutes might feel like a gift from the gods.\n\n**Related:[Best mattress](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nmattresses-3461169)**\n\nThings get a little more interesting in terms of IFTTT automation. Nokia\nenvisages the Sleep as being able to control your other smart home devices\nthrough IFTTT, triggering recipes such as turning off the lights when it\ndetects you’re in bed, or dialling up the thermostat when you get out.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nAll data syncs with Nokia’s Health Mate app, so if you have any of Nokia’s\nother health products – the [Nokia\nBody](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nokia-body) smart scale or [Nokia\nSteel HR](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/withings-steel-hr), for\nexample – then you can get an all-encompassing view of your important metrics.\nThe Nokia Sleep will be available in Q1 for £100.\n\n![Nokia Steel HR Rose\nGold](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nOn the topic of the Nokia Health app, Nokia also used CES to also announce new\nAlexa integration.
