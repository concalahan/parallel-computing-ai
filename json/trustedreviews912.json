The purpose is to create a bespoke collection of speakers\nthat “tastefully enhances luxury design within the home.”\n\nThe Bronze Collection is made up of five wireless multiroom speakers that, you\nguessed it, all sport a bronze hue. The speakers that make up the collection\nare the [Beoplay A9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/b-o-a9) floor\nspeaker, [Beoplay M5](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/beoplay-m5-the-\nstylish-new-360-degree-speaker-with-chromecast-built-in-2949091), [BeoSound\n1](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/bang-olufsen-beosound-1) and\n[BeoSound 2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/bang-olufsen-beosound-\nrelease-date-price-specs-3539300) (the M5, BeoSound 1 and 2 all offer 360\ndegree sound).\n\nLast, but not least, is the all new BeoSound Edge speaker, which was created\nin a collaboration with contemporary designer Michael Anastassiades.\n\n![BeoSound Edge Bronze\nCollection](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nOn the use of bronze, Bang & Olufsen architects and designers Anne Mee Dybbroe\nAndersen and Anna-Sophia Brune say that the tone ensures the speakers stay\n“neutral from day to night, season to season and year to year – maintaining\nits elegance and splendour regardless of trends and changing fashions”.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Bang & Olufsen announces Bronze Collection of multiroom speakers\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/bo-bronze-collection-3613043 \"Bang &\nOlufsen announces Bronze Collection of multiroom speakers\")\n\n  * [ ![OnePlus 6T head on](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### The OnePlus 6T might soon be available from Three\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/three-uk-oneplus-3613430 \"The OnePlus 6T\nmight soon be available from Three\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Google Home](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Google Home Black Friday Deals: What to expect and deals live now\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/google-home-black-friday-3333404\n\"Google Home Black Friday Deals: What to expect and deals live now\")\n\n  * \n\nNot unsurprisingly from a luxury brand such as B&O, the Bronze Collection is\nnot cheap. Nor would we imagine, from an aesthetic point-of-view, they’d go\nalongside your dinky £100 soundbar too well. This is for those with deep\npockets and an interest in design.\n\nThe recommended retail price for the limited edition speakers are as follows:\n\n  * **Beoplay M5** – £529\n  * **Beosound 1** – £1,250\n  * **Beosound 2** – £1,650\n  * **Beoplay A9** – £2,099\n  * **Beosound Edge** – £2,900\n\nThe majority of the range is available to purchase from B&O stores, online and\nfrom selected retailers from October 30th. The BeoSound Edge goes on sale\nDecember 2018.\n\n**Do you think the Bronze Collection looks the part? Let us know on Facebook\nor tweet at as @TrustedReviews**\n\n"}
