Colours are punchy and bright, without beingoversaturated, and they’re accurate too. The wide colour gamut is great forwatching video as it was originally intended and accurately editing snaps,making this a strong media machine.There is a slight pinkish tinge to the display when it’s tilted to the sideand this dampens viewing angles, but it’s not a deal-breaker. Viewing anglesare still great and reflections are kept to a minimum, but colours are skewedever so slightly when you’re not looking directly at it. I had a similar issuewith the [Galaxy S7 Edge](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-s7-edge-review), so it’s certainly not a problem exclusive to HTC’sdisplays.The HTC 10 is missing a feature both the LG G5 and Galaxy S7 tout, which is anAlways-On mode. This clever method of displaying your most recentnotifications when the display is seemingly off is far from essential, butit’s a useful extra that I’ve grown to like after using those two phones. LGmanaged it with an LCD screen, so I’m not sure why HTC hasn’t tried anythingsimilar.What it does offer over its rivals is improved brightness. Well, in certainsituations. In regular use, the maximum brightness on the HTC 10 is muchbrighter than that of the LG G5 and Galaxy S7, though it doesn’t feature thetrick used by those two where it can boost brightness even more in directsunlight. Still, the HTC 10 is perfectly usable outdoors.[ Next  Performance, Audio and Software](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/htc-10-performance-audio-and-software-page-2)"}
