Here’s\neverything you need to know about this year’s show, including all the best MWC\nphones from the likes of Samsung, Sony, LG, Moto and more.**\n\nMobile World Congress – otherwise known as MWC – is an annual trade show run\nby the GSMA, where manufacturers come together to showcase their latest\nphones, smartwatches, tablets, and more. It’s easily the biggest mobile phone\nshow on the planet, and started with a bang when Samsung launched the [Galaxy\nS9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9) and [Galaxy\nS9+](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9-plus).\n\nAs well as phones, Mobile World Congress is also home to a number of more\nspecialist innovations, including flexible displays, state-of-the-art mobile\nchipsets, next-generation artificial intelligence solutions and 5G\ndemonstrations. Plus, there are plenty of apps, software, and mobile\naccessories on display – there really is something for everyone at the Fira\nGran Via.\n\n## Best MWC 2018 phones and devices\n\nIt’s difficult for even the most devoted of tech fans to keep track of\neverything and spot one of the many diamonds hidden in the rough as a result.\nBut fear not, we’re here to help.\n\nWith MWC drawing to a close, we’ve cherrypicked the very coolest things to\nappear, awarding them _Trusted_ ’s hallowed ‘Best of Show’ award.\n\nHighlights include everything from top-notch new handsets, to 5G network\ninnovations and alien-esque health trackers. Here’s our pick of the best\nthings to come out of MWC 2018:\n\n### Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9+\n\nThis one should come as no surprise. Samsung’s been the undisputed king of the\nsmartphone market for close to decade now and it’s latest Galaxy S9 and Galaxy\nS+ handsets look set to continue this trend. Though the two phones don’t look\nthat different to the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy 8+, which have both now had a nice\nprice cut, under the hood Samsung’s made a number of subtle but important\nimprovements.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThese include basic spec upgrades, like the move to Qualcomm’s latest\nSnapdragon 845 CPU, plus more interesting additions, like its new mechanical\nvariable aperture rear camera sensor. The tech reportedly improves performance\nby letting the camera intelligently switch between f/2.4 and f/1.5 apertures\ndepending on the environment it’s being used in. From what we’ve seen it works\na treat and, coupled with the both phone’s uber swish looks, could make the S9\nand S9+ contenders for phone of the year, if they deliver on their opening\npromise.\n\nWith pricing for the basic S9 started at over £700, you’ll have to pay a hefty\nprice for the privilege of owning them, however.\n\n### Xperia XZ2\n\nIt’s no secret, we here at Trusted haven’t been huge fans of Sony’s previous\nXperia phones over the last few years. Which is why we were surprised quite\nhow much we like Sony’s spiffy new Xperia XZ2 flagship.\n\nSony’s finally ditched the squarish omnibalance design that plagued past\nXperias for the XZ2. The flat, hard to hold design has been replaced with a\nbeautiful looking mixed material chassis, featuring a lovely 2.5D, slightly\ncurved glass back.\n\nSony’s also worked hard to improve the phone’s internals, loading it with a\nSnapdragon 845 CPU, larger battery, upgraded rear camera and “20% louder\nspeakers”. The end result is one of the best Sony phones we’ve seen in years\nNokia  \nAll the headlines may have been about Nokia’s banana phone, but it was the\nNokia 7+ that stole the show for us. It may not be the sexiest looking handset\naround, but it on paper has the chops to be one of the best mid-range phones\non the market.\n\nUnder its unassuming metal hood Nokia’s loaded the 7+ with a number of cutting\nedge specs you normally wouldn’t expect to see on a €399 phone. Highlights\ninclude a 6-inch 18:9 FHD+ resolution display, Snapdragon 660 CPU and generous\n64GB of storage.\n\nIf this wasn’t enough to entice you it’s also running Android One: a\ncompletely clean install of Android that’s blissfully free of bloatware and\nduplicate applications.\n\n### Huawei MateBook X Pro\n\nThe Huawei MateBook X Pro may not be the first name you think of when shopping\nfor a super expensive ultrabook, but its latest Matebook X Pro is without a\ndoubt one of the prettiest laptops we’ve seen this year.\n\nFeaturing a svelte, super slim design, cutting edge Intel 8th Gen CPU, wealth\nof memory and storage options, plus a beautiful 13.9-inch, 3000 x 2000 LTPS,\n260ppi display the Matebook X Pro has the hardware to take on Apple’s ruling\nMacbook Pro, on paper.\n\nAdd to this a number of nifty design innovations, like the new quad-speaker\nsystem and “recessed” webcam, which can be hidden in the Matebook’s keyboard,\nand the X Pro clearly earns its place as on of the highlights of MWC 2018.\n\n### Lenovo Vital\n\nThe Lenovo Vital is the latest Moto Mod for Motorola’s Z line of smartphones.\nUnlike the gimmicky Polaroid Insta-share mobile printer it looks like it could\nbe pretty useful.\n\nWhen attached to the back of a compatible Moto Z-series smartphone, the\nperipheral acts as a biometric scanner that can be used to detect key health\nstats including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, plus oxygen and\ntemperature.\n\nThe idea is that the data can then be logged or shared with an accredited\nhealth professional, in theory saving you the need to take a trip to your GP\nwhen you’re feeling under the weather, or have a recurring health condition\nthat requires regular check-ups.\n\n### Qualcomm Snapdragon 700\n\nThis MWC’s been all about phones running Qualcomm’s uber-powerful new\nSnapdragon 845 CPU, but for us it’s the company’s newly unveiled 700 series\nthat stole the show.\n\nThe new CPU is designed to replace Qualcomm’s 6-series, which appears in great\nvalue phones like the Nokia 7+ and Asus Zenfone 5 and features a number of key\nupgrades.\n\nHighlights include Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 4+, Bluetooth 5 support plus a\nnumber of nifty AI and camera optimisations.\n\n### Intel 5G Notebook partnership\n\nPeople have been banging on about 5G for years now, but this MWC Intel finally\nput its money where it’s mouth is and announced a wave of new technologies to\nbring the connectivity to notebook laptops.\n\nSpecifically Intel revealed it’s inked deals with key players, including Dell,\nHP, Lenovo and Microsoft to bring launch laptops using its 5G enabled Intel\nXMM 8000 in the second half of 2019.\n\nGiven that 5G’s not meant to launch in the UK until 2022 at the earliest this\nisn’t a huge deal for general consumers at the moment, but it’s still nice to\nsee Intel taking the tech seriously and we can’t wait to get our hands on one\nof the hyper connected laptops.\n\n### Land Rover Explorer phone\n\nThe Land Rover phone is the latest rugged handset from CAT, the company behind\nthe predator vision CAT S60. It may not have a thermal imaging sensor, like\nits predecessor, but it still looks pretty awesome and could be a solid choice\nfor any outdoorsy person in need of an indestructible phone.\n\nDeveloped by Bullitt Group, the phone features an ultra-rugged case protecting\nthe handset from extreme temperatures, salt water and thermal shock. For\nrugged folks who regularly find themselves scaling mountains it also has a\nnumber of useful software installed. Highlights include topographic mapping\noptions from ViewRanger, an Augmented Reality Skyline feature and instant\naccess to a dashboard that includes weather information, sensor data and an\nSOS light toggle.\n\n### Asus Zenfone 5\n\nThe Zenfone 5 is the latest smartphone from PC heavyweight Asus. The handset\ntargets the same market as the OnePlus 5T, but comes with a number of design\ninnovations that make it look more like a £600-plus phone than a mid-ranger.\n\nHighlights include beautiful, near edge-to-edge 18:9 display Asus claims\ncovers the full DCI-P3 colour gamut, plus a reworked dual-lens rear camera\nwith AI capabilities. Asus claims the camera can detect and intelligently\noptimise itself to shoot in 16 different conditions.\n\nIf Asus claims ring true, then the Zenfone 5 could be a perfect choice for\npeople on the market for an affordable camera-phone when it launches later\nthis year.\n\n### Lenovo Yoga 730\n\nThe Yoga 730 is the latest foldable laptop from Lenovo. At first glance it\ndoesn’t look that different to the company’s stellar 2017 laptop, the Yoga\n720. It features the same hinged design, that lets you turn it into a tablet\nby folding the screen onto the keyboard’s back, a fairly similar set of screen\nsize and resolution options, that top out at UHD. Specs-wise the only big\ndifference is the move to Intel’s 8th Gen CPU family.\n\nBut delve a little close and you’ll find it has one unique and totally awesome\nfeature: Amazon Alexa support. Under-the-hood Lenovo’s loaded the 730 with\nomni-directional mics that make it quick and easy to take advantage of\nAmazon’s smart assistant.\n\nThis may not sound like much to people yet to make the smart home jump, but\nfor those with other smart devices it could be a unique selling point for the\nlaptop when it launches later this year.\n\n## MWC 2018: Live news and latest updates\n\nAs expected, Samsung has unveiled two new flagships, the [Galaxy\nS9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9) and [Galaxy\nS9+](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9-plus). These are\ntwo of the most eagerly anticipated phones of the year, coming with improved\ncamera technology, better internals and [Android\nOreo](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/android-8-0-oreo).\n\nThat was the first – and arguably most important – MWC 2018 phone reveal, but\nthere are legitimate Galaxy S9 rivals in Sony’s [Xperia\nXZ2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sony-xperia-xz2) and [XZ2\nCompact](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sony-xperia-xz2-compact), the\nformer of which packs the new [Snapdragon\n845](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/snapdragon-845-benchmark-phones-\nspeed-3390981) SoC. Our early impressions suggest they’re decent phones, too,\nso the battle for the ‘Best Phone of MWC 2018’ hasn’t been a whitewash.\n\nStealing the thunder in a retro stylee for the second year running, Nokia took\na leaf out of its dog-eared playbook to launch the [Nokia 8110\n4G](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nokia-8110-4g), a modern (sort of)\ntake on the legendary _Matrix_ banana phone. More retro chic came in the form\nof the [Psion Gemini](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/psion-gemini-\npda-2947858) PDA, on which we rolled back the years by playing Street Fighter\nII.\n\nOf the other smaller players, we’ve seen the British [STK\nX2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/stk-x2-price-release-date-\nspecs-3404639) budget smartphone, which looks very slick indeed, as well as\nthe ruggedised [Land Rover Explorer](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/land-\nrover-phone-explore-release-date-specs-price-battery-life-mods-3401561).\n\n**Related:[Best Samsung Galaxy S9\ndeals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-samsung-\ngalaxy-s9-deals-3402357)**\n\n## MWC 2018 Phones: The best MWC phones announced so far and what to expect\n\nBefore we go into finer details, here’s an at-a-glance look at the phones,\ntablets, laptops and other devices that have been announced so far, and what\nelse we’re expecting to see unveiled at MWC 2018.\n\n  * **Alcatel:** New flagship\n  * **Doro:** [Doro 7060 and 8035](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/new-doro-phones-2018-3405476)\n  * **Huawei:** [MateBook X Pro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/matebook-x-pro), [MediaPad M5 tablets](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/huawei-mediapad-m5-3403512)\n  * **Land Rover:** [Land Rover Explorer](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/land-rover-phone-explore-release-date-specs-price-battery-life-mods-3401561)\n  * **Lenovo:** [Yoga 730](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/lenovo-yoga-730), [Yoga 530](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/lenovo-yoga-530)\n  * **LG:** [LG V30S ThinQ](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/lg-v30s)\n  * **Moto:**[Lenovo Vital Moto Mod](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/lenovo-vital-moto-mod)\n  * **Nokia:**[Nokia 7+](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nokia-7-plus), [Nokia 8 Sirocco](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nokia-8-sirocco), [Nokia 8110 4G](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nokia-8110-4g)\n  * **Samsung:**[Galaxy S9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9) and [Galaxy S9+](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9-plus)\n  * **Sony:**[Xperia XZ2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sony-xperia-xz2) and [Xperia XZ2 Compact](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sony-xperia-xz2-compact)\n  * **STK:** [STK X2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/stk-x2-price-release-date-specs-3404639)\n\n## MWC 2018 Dates: When is Mobile World Congress 2018?\n\nMobile World Congress runs from February 26 through March 1, with most of the\nbig announcements – including Samsung’s expected unveiling of the Galaxy S9 –\nhaving taken place at invite-only events on February 25.\n\n**Related:[Galaxy S9 vs iPhone\nX](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/galaxy-s9-vs-iphone-x-3402202)**\n\n## MWC 2018 News and Rumours: Everything revealed at MWC 2018\n\nLet’s take a closer look at what the key mobile players have unveiled in this\nyear’s MWC, or what we’re still expecting, in alphabetical order. So read on\nor scroll down for what we’ve seen from the likes of Samsung, Sony and others,\nplus what may still be revealed.\n\n**Related:[Samsung Galaxy S9 vs Galaxy\nS8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s9-vs-\ngalaxy-s8-3402874)**\n\n### **BlackBerry at MWC 2018**\n\n![BlackBerry\nKeyOne](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nTCL has confirmed that it will launch at least two [new BlackBerry phones in\n2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/new-blackberry-\nphones-2018-keyone-2-keytwo-3368773). That’s the good news. Now here’s the bad\nnews: the expected follow-up to last year’s surprisingly decent [BlackBerry\nKEYOne](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/blackberry-keyone) still hasn’t\nbroken cover. No new BlackBerry at MWC, sadly.\n\n**Related:[ Blackberry Motion\nreview](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/blackberry-motion)**\n\n### **Doro at MWC 2018**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nDoro has busted out two new handsets aimed at the elderly, the [Doro 7060 and\n8035](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/new-doro-phones-2018-3405476). The\n7060 offers an old-school clamshell design but with 4G connectivity, some\nsocial-media smarts, and a boost function to make call volume louder.\n\nThe Doro 8035, meanwhile, is more a stepping stone to a full smartphone\nexperience, with the option to use either a simplified interface or a near-\nstock Android OS complete with full Play Store access. There’s also a remote-\naccess app, so younger, more able relatives can see what’s happening on the\nphone to help fix any problems or explain how to use it. Very neat indeed.\n\n### **Google at MWC 2018**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nBig G typically throws lavish events at independent venues when it’s\nannouncing new hardware, so we didn’t expect too much from Google at MWC.\n\nWhat we did get was a first wave of phones powered by [Android\nGo](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/android-go-phones-2949127), a\nstripped-back version of Google’s latest [Android\nOreo](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/android-8-0-oreo) operating\nsystem that’s been made available on seriously affordable handsets. Among\nthese were the [Nokia 1](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/nokia-1-new-\nnokia-phones-2018-3403599) and ZTE Tempo Go.\n\n### HTC at MWC 2018\n\nIt’s been a subdued outing for HTC at MWC this year, with nothing new\nannounced. The [HTC U12](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/htc-u12-release-\ndate-price-specs-leaks-rumours-3365974) is likely to launch at a standalone\nevent later in the year.\n\n### **Huawei at MWC 2018**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nBruce Lee, Huawei’s VP of Smartphones, revealed last year that Huawei will\n“probably” launch all future flagships at Mobile World Congress – and recent\nleaks would’ve led you to believe that it’d be taking the wraps off the\n[Huawei P20](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/huawei-p20-release-date-\nspecs-price-news-leaks-rumours-3384595) at the gathering.\n\nBut that hasn’t been the case, and the firm already sent out invitations to a\nstandalone event it’s holding in Paris on March 27. That’s where it’s expected\nto announce not only the flagship Huawei P20, but also the Huawei P20 Lite and\nHuawei P20 Plus.\n\nThat’s not to mean Huawei’s presence at MWC 2018 hasn’t been notable, however.\nThe firm has announced the high-end [MateBook X\nPro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/matebook-x-pro) ultrabook and a\nrange of [Mediapad M5](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/huawei-\nmediapad-m5-3403512) Android tablets.\n\n**Related:[Huawei P11](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/huawei-p11-release-\ndate-specs-price-rumours-uk-3351241)**\n\n### **LG at MWC 2018**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nWe’d thought that we’d be seeing LG unveil its next flagship, the [LG\nG7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-g7-release-date-specs-price-\nrumours-2952060), at this year’s Mobile World Congress, but recent reports\npoured cold water on that idea. Apparently, LG is rebuilding the G7 from\nscratch and the handset might not see light of day until April.\n\nInstead we got an upgraded [LG\nV30](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/lg-v30) successor, the [LG V30S\nThinQ](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/lg-v30s). From what we’ve seen,\nnone of the original’s issues are fixed; the specs are merely upgraded a\nlittle. Oh, and it has a name straight from the mid-noughties.\n\nIn addition to that, the company already confirmed new mid-range [2018 LG\nphones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/new-lg-phones-2018-3401592) prior\nto the event.\n\n### **Motorola (Moto) at MWC 2018**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nWe thought Lenovo-owned Motorola might throw the kitchen sink at MWC this\nyear, unveiling new Moto E, Moto G and [Moto\nX](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/moto-x-style) handsets – but not\neven the company’s mid-range Moto G range got the catwalk treatment in Barca.\n\nRecently leaked information pointed towards the unveiling of the [Moto G6, G6\nPlus and G6 Play](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/moto-g6-release-date-\nspecs-price-features-uk-3373699), each of which should offer some solid specs\nat an affordable price. No sign yet, though.\n\nWhat we did get was easily the most interesting Moto Mod so far, the [Lenovo\nVital](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/lenovo-vital-moto-mod). This\nbolt-on accessory for the Moto Z series can track loads of aspects of your\nhealth, and promises a sharing feature that means you could send readings\ndirectly to your doctor.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nImage: Droid-Life\n\n### ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### **Nokia at MWC 2018**\n\nNokia has announced a trio of handsets at MWC 2018, including one interesting\nsurprise. First up is the [Nokia 8\nSirocco](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nokia-8-sirocco), a flagship\ndesigned to compete at the highest level, as well as the mid-range [Nokia\n7+](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nokia-7-plus), which looks very\nimpressive. What might set pulses racing, however, is the [Nokia 8110\n4G](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nokia-8110-4g) – a reimagining of\nthe iconic _Matrix_ phone. Unlike last year’s gimmicky [Nokia\n3310](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nokia-3310), this one actually\nhas some practical value as a second phone.\n\n### Qualcomm at MWC 2018\n\n![Qualcomm](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nQualcomm had a particularly busy CES this year, and while you might think that\nleaves little left for MWC just a month later, the American semiconductor\ngiant had a trick or two up its sleeve for Barcelona.\n\nFor starters, the [Snapdragon\n845](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/snapdragon-845-phones-benchmark-\nspeeds-release-date-camera-quick-charge-4-3350708) SoC appeared on the Galaxy\nS9 and Xperia XZ2. Then Qualcomm announced its all-new\n[700-series](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/qualcomm-\nsnapdragon-700-series-benchmarks-phones-speed-3405488) SoC range, which\npromises to bring 800-series features to more affordable devices. Expect Quick\nCharge 4+ tech and Bluetooth 5 to hit budget phones before long.\n\nElsewhere, the first generation of [Snapdragon\nlaptops](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/snapdragon-laptops-3400795)\nfeatured, with release dates and regional pricing revealed for these ultra-\nefficient new Windows 10 machines.\n\n**Related:[Qualcomm in 2018 – what to\nexpect](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/qualcomm-2018-preview-3372649)**\n\n### **Samsung at MWC 2018**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIt came as no surprise. Samsung has unveiled the much-anticipated [Galaxy\nS9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9) and [Galaxy\nS9+](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9-plus) at MWC\n2018, and we’ve already had a play with them. The design may only look\nevolutionary, but the dual-aperture camera tech could yet prove to be\nrevolutionary.\n\n**Related:[Samsung Galaxy S9 vs Galaxy\nS9+](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-\ngalaxy-s9-vs-s9-plus-3402865)**\n\n### **Sony at MWC 2018**\n\n![Sony Xperia XZ\n9](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nJapanese manufacturer Sony has already launched three of its six smartphones\nset to hit the shelves in 2018, leaving two for MWC 2018: the high-end\n5.8-inch [Xperia XZ2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sony-xperia-xz2)\nwith a Snapdragon 845 SoC, and the 4.6-inch [Xperia XZ2\nCompact](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sony-xperia-xz2-compact). They\nlook very promising, with an all-new design language for Sony. It’s about\ntime, too.\n\n**Related:[Sony Xperia XZ2 vs XZ2\nCompact](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/sony-xperia-xz2-vs-xperia-\nxz2-compact-3403834)**\n\n### **STK at MWC 2018**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nBritish company STK has taken aim at OnePlus and Moto with a new entrant to\nthe budget market that looks lovely and seems to pack a powerful punch. The\n[STK X2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/stk-x2-price-release-date-\nspecs-3404639) has a glass and aluminium body that feels more premium than you\nmight expect for £259, and has a software optimisation tool that claims to\nprevent slowdown over extended use.\n\n**What are you most looking forward to at MWC 2018?
