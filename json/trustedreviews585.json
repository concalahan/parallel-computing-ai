It offered players an engrossing\nworld where they could work together, or against each other while collecting\nloot and fighting a virus to save a city. Ubisoft also deserves credit for how\nit has maintained a community throughout the game’s lifecycle, with continuous\nsupport and a drip feed of content. Based on our hands-on at E3 2018, The\nDivision 2 looks set to do more of the same, with a great new setting,\ngorgeous visuals and the same excellent gameplay.\n\nThe Division is not a game for casual players. It demands a lot from players\nwho need to dedicate a lot of hours just to scratch the surface. In the E3\nhands-on, the developers let us play as level 30 characters, with a gentle\nnote that this is considered when The Division 2 actually “starts”. The reason\nfor this is that’s when Specialisations unlock, multiple character types that\nwill allow more weapons and abilities for even greater depth.\n\nThat makes it fair to say that this will be a meaty game.\n\n**Related:[Assassin’s Creed Odyssey latest\nnews](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/assassins-creed-odyssey-release-\ndate-gameplay-3480002)**\n\n![the division 2\n](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nThe three playable specialisations in this build were demolition,\nsharpshooter, and survivalist. I was plonked as a sharpshooter, the sniper\nclass, whose superweapon is a 50 Cal, which can fire through enemies and hit\ntheir weak points.\n\nThe demo starts with the four of us getting to grips with our characters. My\nguy is armed with a special perk of a drone that can attack enemies on\ncommand, which is great for aggroing baddies to create a distraction and keep\nthe fire off your back when you need it most.\n\nEntering the first building, there are two entry points, the front door and go\nloud, and up high for a more advantageous position. As a sniper, I went up\nhigh to get the jump on enemies down below and provide cover fire. Having each\nof the different character types was a great boon that encouraged cooperation\nbetween me and my teammates. We naturally fit into our roles and worked\ntogether to clear the room. The demolitionist in the loudest way possible,\nmyself picking enemies off in a more elegant way, the survivalist keeping the\ncrew together.\n\nThe Division 2’s enemy AI has a good mix of conservative and aggressive, too.\nSome enemies keep their distance, hiding behind cover, and peppering you with\nshots. They also spread out and flank meaning you always have to be aware of\nyour surroundings in 360-degrees and need to keep fire on enemies trying to\nmove on your position. This is not helped by the aggressive types who rush\nstraight up the middle and also tend to carry extra armour to boot.\n\n**Related:[Skull and Bones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/skull-and-\nbones-release-date-2993779)**\n\n![the division 2\n](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nThe equaliser in all this is each enemy carries a giant and very obvious weak\npoint: a big red pack, often on the back of their waist, which if shot can\neither explode or disable their ability (like a medic being able to heal\ndowned enemies). It’s a cool system that encourages players to move around the\nfield rather than hunker down and just keep firing from the same position ala\n[Gears of War](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/gears-of-war-5-news-\nrelease-date-2949338).\n\nThe demo ends with a giant takedown of an enemy position near a downed\nairplane. The mix of standard and heavily armoured enemies meant the combat\nmaintained an intensity that kept things exciting. The closing wave mode from\na hunkered down position was also great. Even without us communicating, The\nDivision 2 still managed to be great fun and a game where we all worked\ntogether.\n\n##  **First** impressions\n\nI had a lot of fun in my brief time with The Division 2. It’s a visually\nstunning game that looks set to evolve everything that the first game did, and\nnow with an exciting new setting and tons more content for players to dive in\nand start unlocking. Plus all content is free for players, too, so there’s no\nexcuse to not be excited.\n\n## The Division 2 trailers — All the latest\n\nWe’ve now had a number of different looks at The Division 2 thanks to it\nappearing on stage at both Microsoft and Ubisoft’s press conferences. You can\nwatch all the trailers in all their glory below.\n\n_**What would you like to see from The Division 2? Let us know on Facebook and\nTwitter @trustedreviews.**_\n\n"}
