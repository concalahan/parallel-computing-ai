With that in mind, we thought we’d\ntake an early look at how the S7, and its curvy cousin the S7 Edge, compare to\nthe Note 7.\n\nHere’s everything you need to know.\n\n**Related:[Galaxy Note 7 vs iPhone 6S\nPlus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-7-vs-\niphone-6s-plus)**  \n **  \nVIDEO: Galaxy S7 review  \n**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n**  \n**\n\n## Samsung Galaxy Note 7 vs Galaxy S7 – Design **  \n**  \n\nFirst up, measurements. The Note 7 comes it at 153.5 x 73.9 x 7.9mm and weighs\n169g. That makes it more bulky overall than the S7, which is 142.4 x 69.6mm\nbut measures the same 7.9mm when it comes to thickness. It’s also much lighter\nat 152g.\n\nInterestingly, the [S7 Edge](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-\ngalaxy-s7-edge-review), which is almost the same size as the Note, at 150.9 x\n72.6mm, is very slightly thinner than both the Note and the S7, coming in at\n7.7mm. That’s no doubt down to the larger case, at least when you consider it\nalongside the standard S7. But the Note 7 is larger still, and we’d have\nexpected it to be as thin as the Edge at least, especially considering it’s\ngot a smaller battery. Perhaps all the S Pen stylus tech adds to the bulk?\n\nEither way, the Note 7 is the larger of all the devices, as you’d expect from\na phablet, and it’s not much thicker than the S7 Edge.\n\n**Related:[Hands on with the Galaxy Note\n7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-note-7-review)  \n**\n\n**[![samsung galaxy note\n7](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/samsung-\ngalaxy-s7-vs-galaxy-s6)**\n\nWhen it comes to colours, the Note 7 comes in a choice of three hues – Black\nOnyx, Silver Titanium, and Blue Coral (which is new). **** The S7, in\ncontrast, comes in a few more options: black, gold, white, silver, or the\ndelightfully gaudy pink gold.\n\nColours are all well and good, but what are these phones actually made of?\nWell, Samsung can’t be faulted when it comes to its flagship phone. The\nmaterials and build quality on the S7 and S7 Edge are stellar. Dare we say,\nspellbinding? No, on second thoughts, stellar will do.\n\nBoth the standard phone and the Edge variant are made from metal alloy with a\nglass front and back. The Edge obviously has those sleek curves working in its\nfavour, but then, so does the Note 7. With a dual-curved-edge design, the Note\n7 looks a lot like the S7 Edge, which certainly isn’t a bad thing. It also has\nthe benefit of stronger Gorilla Glass 5, which makes its debut on the new\nhandset.\n\n**Watch: Galaxy Note 7 hands-on**\n\nAll these devices are also IP68 rated, which means you can dunk them in 1m of\nwater for up to 30 minutes without damaging them.\n\nIn all, the S7, S7 Edge, and Note 7 are fantastic-looking handsets. While the\ndual curved edges of the Note 7 definitely add something to the overall\ndesign, the S7 itself is more compact, which will always help it look that\nextra bit sleeker. This one is going to depend on personal preference, then.\n(But no one’s ever looked cool whipping out a phablet, if you ask us.)\n\n## Samsung Galaxy Note 7 vs Galaxy S7 – Display\n\nPerhaps one of the most important elements of a smartphone is its screen, and\nSamsung has made efforts to ensure its 2016 range of handsets can compete with\nthe best. Both the S7 and S7 Edge come with Super AMOLED displays, with a QHD\nresolution of 2,560 x 1,440. While the standard model has a 5.1-inch screen,\nthe Edge features a slightly larger 5.5-inch offering. In both cases, the\nresolution is enough to ensure crisp images. You won’t be noticing any\nindividual pixels on these things.\n\nSo, what has the company done when it comes to its premium Note 7 device?\nWell, the larger 5.7-inch display features the same 2,560 x 1,140 resolution,\nwhich, again, provides more than enough pixels per inch to ensure a sharp\npicture. But this is a higher-end device after all, so there had to be some\nimprovements over the S7 range. And that comes in the form of Mobile HDR,\nwhich we’re obviously yet to test out in full, but should provide some pretty\nvivid pictures.\n\nIf you’re confused about HDR, we’ve got a full [What is\nHDR?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/hdr-tv-high-dynamic-television-\nexplained) guide you can check out. In short, you should expect greater detail\nin the darkest and lightest areas of the picture, improving realism overall –\nalthough we’re sceptical about how effective HDR can be on a smartphone\nscreen.\n\n**Related:[Best smartphone](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-\nsmartphone_round-up)**\n\n**![Galaxy\nS7](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)**\n\nOne other major difference between the S7 and the Note 7 is, of course, the S\nPen. Samsung’s stylus now comes with a number of improvements packed in. The\npen is now water-resistant, coming with the same IP68 rating as the phablet\nitself, so you can stop during a rain storm to jot down a few thoughts.\n\nIt also works when the screen is locked, and has a pressure sensor which can\nregister 4,096 levels of pressure. None of this can be done on either the S7\nor the S7 Edge, which don’t support the S Pen.\n\nThe other thing to note when it comes to the different displays is that, as we\nmentioned, the Note 7’s display is covered in the stronger Gorilla Glass 5,\nwhile the S7 and S7 Edge both come with the previous Gorilla Glass 4. Both\nmaterials are pretty strong, but the Note 7 wins in terms of screen\ndurability. Or you could just not drop your phone.\n\nOverall then, it could be the case that, due to its smaller size, images on\nthe S7 will appear slightly sharper than on the Note 7. But, as both have a\nQHD display, the difference should be negligible. The Mobile HDR on the Note 7\ncould make a difference, but we’re yet to see any evidence, and the phablet\nwill no doubt hold up better when dropped. With all that in mind, we have to\ngive this one to the Note.  \n ****\n\n## Samsung Galaxy Note 7 vs Galaxy S7 – Hardware\n\nWhen it comes to performance and hardware, you’d expect the Note 7, Samsung’s\nmost premium device, to have the edge over its slightly lesser cousins. With\nan octa-core Snapdragon 820 or Exynos 8890 CPU (depending on where you live),\n4GB of LPDDR RAM, and 64GB internal storage, however, you’re looking at an\nidentical set of specs to those of the S7 and the Edge.\n\n**Related:[ Note 7 vs Note 5 vs Note\n4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-7-vs-note-5-vs-\nnote-4)[](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/samsung-\ngalaxy-s7-vs-s7-edge)**\n\n![Note 7](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThat’s right, the Note 7 doesn’t offer any significant performance advantages\nover its smaller counterparts. In fact, it offers none at all, which may\nsurprise you, but when you consider that the S7 is still the most powerful\nphone you can buy, it’s kinda hard to complain.\n\nIn day-to-day usage, then, these handsets are plenty fast. There’s a good 30%\nboost in CPU performance and 64% in GPU performance over the Exynos 7 chip\nused in the S6. Any slowdown can be attributed to Samsung’s less-than-\ndesirable Android skin, TouchWiz.\n\nThe only significant hardware difference between the S7/Edge and the Note 7 is\nthe inclusion of an iris scanner on the latter. You can use this in certain\napps as well as to unlock the phone, and Samsung assures us it’s secure and\neasy to use. We’ll have more on that once we’ve reviewed the phone.\n\nOne other slight difference worth mentioning is that the Note 7 only comes\nwith 64GB of internal storage, whereas the S7 and S7 Edge can be bought with\neither 32GB or 64GB. Either way, you can whack a microSD card in all of these\nphones, so it’s not really a big deal.\n\nWithout any major differences between the handsets, then, it’s difficult to\ncall a winner in the hardware division. There is, of course, the S Pen to take\ninto account, and the extra functionality that brings to the table. But when\nit comes down to it, performance should be similarly spectacular across all\nthese devices.\n\n## Samsung Galaxy Note 7 vs Galaxy S7 – Software\n\nAnother area where things remain relatively similar is software. Google isn’t\nquite ready to unleash Android Nougat’s final version upon the masses just\nyet, and as such, the Note 7 will arrive with good old Android Marshmallow.\nAnd that’s exactly what you’ll find on the S7 and S7 Edge, too.\n\n**Related:[Galaxy Note 7 UK release date and price – how to pre-order  \n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-7-release-date-\nprice-revealed-uk-pre-order-buy-best-deals-free-gear-vr)**\n\n**[![samsung galaxy note 7\n5](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/samsung-\ngalaxy-s7-vs-iphone-6s)**\n\nThankfully, Marshmallow is a great OS which worked perfectly well on the S7,\nespecially since Samsung seems to have done all it can to tone down the\nintrusiveness of TouchWiz. The company’s Android skin has been a major\ndrawback for all Galaxy phones, with its seemingly needless graphical overlays\nand duplicate apps. Luckily, this time around, it’s not quite so irritating,\n\nInterestingly, Samsung promises a streamlined UI, featuring less colours on\nthe Note 7, which we can only imagine is to give users the feeling that the\nextra cash they shelled out for the phablet was worth it for the understated\naesthetics, as it doesn’t seem to alter functionality in any way.\n\nThe Note will also obviously come with special software to support the S Pen.\nSamsung Notes, which lets you draw (oil paintings, apparently – just what\nwe’ve always wanted…), handwrite and edit images, is included, alongside a few\nmore S Pen apps, we suspect.\n\nWhat’s the upshot when it comes to software, then? You guessed it: no real\ndifference. Notice a theme here?\n\n## Samsung Galaxy Note 7 vs Galaxy S7 – Camera\n\nFor some, the camera on a phone is as important as anything else, and Samsung\nhas made sure to please the lens lads and lasses with the S7 and S7 Edge. Both\nphones have exactly the same cameras, which is a good thing, as it happens to\nbe a seriously capable setup.\n\nThe S7 and S7 Edge come with a 12-megapixel camera with phase detection, Dual\nPixels, OIS, an f/1.7 lens, and a 1/2.6-inch sensor. The drop in megapixels\nfrom 16 on the S6 to 12 on the S7 and S7 Edge, along with the same-sized\nsensor, allows for larger 1.4µm pixels. That means the camera on these things\nis capable of fantastic low-light performance, helped by the bright f/1.7\nlens.\n\n![Galaxy\nS7](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nYou’ll also be able to shoot 4K video, and the 5-megapixel front camera is\nmore than adequate for a Skype sesh and the odd selfie.\n\nSo what does the Note 7 do better than the S7 and the S7 Edge in terms of\ncamera capability? Nothing. It’s the same. And that’s all there is to it. No\nmatter which device you pick up, you can expect the same outstanding\nperformance from the camera setup – which is, when it comes down to it, a\npositive.\n\n## Samsung Galaxy Note 7 vs Galaxy S7 – Battery\n\nThe 3,500mAh battery in the Note 7 is a tad more capacious than the 3,000mAh\noffering in the S7. Surprisingly, though, it’s actually slightly smaller than\nthe one in the S7 Edge, which comes with a 3,600mAh battery.\n\nIn our experience, the S7 and its curvy counterpart will last you a day\neasily, even with moderate to high usage, although the Edge’s battery is\nundoubtedly the more powerful of the two. When it comes to the Note, we expect\na similar situation.\n\n![Galaxy S7\n2](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nBut, it’s worth noting that, in our tests, the Edge was left with around\n25-35% battery after a day of moderate to high usage. That’s with a 3,600mAh\nbattery. The Note 7, in contrast, has to power a bigger screen and stylus\nfunctionality. Both phones run on Android Marshmallow, so the Note doesn’t\nhave any power-saving features that the Edge doesn’t.\n\nAll of this has us slightly – and we mean _slightly_ – concerned that the Note\n7 won’t offer quite the battery performance we were hoping for. That said,\nwe’re yet to test it out, so we can’t say for sure at this point whether the\nNote 7’s cell is up to the task or not.\n\n## Samsung Galaxy Note 7 vs Galaxy S7 – Price & Release Date  \n\nThe S7 and S7 Edge have been available for a few months now, and you can\ncurrently get your hands on the former for around £550, and the latter for\naround £630. These prices will obviously come down as the months go on, but\nthat’s what you’re looking at for the time being.\n\nThe Note 7 has been given a September 2 release date by Samsung, and will go\non sale for an eye-watering £749. While it’s obviously a premium device,\nthat’s a lot of money to shell out, especially when you consider the Galaxy S7\nand S7 Edge are equally capable when it comes to performance.\n\n## Summary\n\nThere’s no doubt the Note 7 is a more capable device than the S7 and the S7\nEdge. The S Pen support alone adds a load more functionality, and you’ve got\nthe extra iris scanner to consider. But it’s also a more bulky device. The\nincreased screen size means the Note 7 isn’t the slickest-looking thing\naround.\n\nOverall, then, you can’t really go wrong with any of these Samsung handsets.\nThe Note 7 and the S7 should be identical in terms of performance, offering\nthe fastest and most advanced user experience you can currently get in a\nsmartphone.\n\n**[Buy Now: Galaxy Note 7 at Amazon.com from $969](http://amzn.to/2bCRi8T)**\n\nWhich one you choose will be down to which design you prefer, whether you need\na stylus, and whether you mind carrying the extra weight around.
