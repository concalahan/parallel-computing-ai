The milled magnesium\nbuild means the Surface Pro 6 is lightweight but durable, the integrated\nkickstand is great for letting you prop the machine up at any angle, meaning\nit’s well-suited for typing, touch and stylus work, plus this generation comes\nin a new matt black finish.\n\nAs with every previous generation, the Surface Pen and Type Cover keyboard\nthat the Surface Pro 6 is almost always pictured with within official imagery\nare actually sold as separate extras, that’ll cost you an extra £100 and £125,\nrespectively.\n\n![iPad Pro 2018 Smart\nKeyboard](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\niPad Pro (2018)\n\nStrangely, Microsoft still seems reluctant to adopt USB-C, meaning the Pro 6’s\nmain connections consist of a mini DisplayPort and a single USB-A port. The\nstrangest aspect of all? For once Apple has shown more willingness to adopt a\nwidely-used connection type.\n\nIn a long-rumoured but still surprising move, both of the company’s new iPad\nPros replace its own Lightning connector with USB-C. This means greater\nversatility, with support for all sorts of third-party devices and\nperipherals; allowing a direct connection to everything from digital cameras\nto (up to) 5K resolution external displays.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nWhile Apple might have beaten Microsoft to the punch with USB-C here, that is\nthe _only_ port on these tablets. There’s not even a headphone jack anymore –\none omission the Surface Pro 6 doesn’t suffer from. There’s also no way to\nphysically expand the storage space on Apple’s tablets either.\n\nLike the Pro 6 and the Surface Pen, the 2018 iPad Pros support Apple’s newly\nrevamped [Apple Pencil 2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-\npencil-2-2018-features-3612981), which implements tap gestures as well as all\nthe functionality of its predecessor (such as tilt and pressure recognition).\nIt also magnetically attaches to the side of these new iPad’s bodies – a trait\nthat Surface tablets have been able to offer for years now.\n\n**Related:[Surface Go\nReview](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/microsoft-surface-go)**\n\n![microsoft surface pro\n6](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nWhile we’ll get to how powerful these machines all are, one aspect that the\nSurface simply cannot compete on is portability. Despite sitting either side\nof the Surface Pro 6’s 12.3-inch display size, both new iPad Pros are smaller,\nthinner and lighter. You don’t benefit from the Surface Pro 6’s integrated\nkickstand but the thin (recycled) aluminium unibody tablets should be easy\nenough to wield without one.\n\n## 2018 iPad Pro vs Surface Pro 6 – Which is the more powerful slate?\n\nNot only are these iPads lighter and thinner than the Surface Pro 6 but based\non Apple’s claims they’re apparently more powerful too. The enhanced Apple\nA12X Bionic chip supposedly offers enough oomph to trump 92% of the laptops\nand similarly-classed machines out there right now, even those using 8th-\ngeneration Intel chips like the Surface Pro 6.\n\n**Related:[Intel Whiskey Lake and Amber\nLake](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/intel-whiskey-lake-amber-\nlake-3515645)**\n\nUnlike Apple’s approach, where price only affects storage and connectivity,\nfor Microsoft’s machine, colour, memory and processor can all be altered for a\nlittle more cash. The Pro 6 comes with either an 8th-generation Intel Core i5\nor i7 direct from Microsoft, with 8GB or 16GB of RAM allocated to each,\nrespectively.\n\nAll the devices in this roundup can offer up to 1TB of internal flash storage,\nhowever, at the other end of the scale Apple’s offerings start out with just\n64GB of space, while Microsoft’s Surface begins at 128GB.\n\nBoth company’s devices rock LCD panels, although Apple has used the same\ntricks it pulled on the [iPhone\nXR](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xr) (pixel masking and anti-\naliasing) to give its latest iPad’s displays rounded corners, making both\nslates look decidedly more cutting-edge against the Surface. Apple’s various\ndisplay technologies, such as ProMotion (a 120Hz refresh rate for super-smooth\nvisuals), TrueTone (Apple tech which adjusts screen colour temperature based\non surrounding ambient light) HDR playback support all up the visual fidelity\nof these iPads far beyond anything Microsoft’s machine can muster.\n\nThe iPads offer higher resolution front and rear cameras and ditch the\nphysical home button of their predecessor, instead integrating [Face\nID](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/face-id-3286453) as first introduced\non last year’s [iPhone X](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-x).\nThe advanced face unlock technology at play has been reworked to function in\nany orientation and unlike the company’s phones, doesn’t sit within a notch\nthis time around. Despite this, the iPads offer slimmer bezels than the\nSurface, whose Windows Hello-compatible face unlock authentication is much\nsimpler and arguably less secure.\n\n| **iPad Pro 11-inch** | **iPad Pro 12.9-inch** | **Surface Pro 6**  \n---|---|---|---  \n**Dimensions** |  247.6 x 178.5 x 5.9mm | 280.6 x 214.9 x 5.9mm | 292 x 201 x\n8.5mm  \n**Weight** |  468g | 631g (WiFi)/633g (cellular) | 770g (i5)/784g (i7)  \n**Display** |  11-inch 4:3 (2388 x 1668) Liquid Retina LCD w/ ProMotion\n(120Hz), DCI-P3, True Tone, HDR10, Dolby Vision | 12.9-inch 4:3 (2732 x 2048)\nLiquid Retina LCD w/ ProMotion (120Hz), DCI-P3, True Tone, HDR10, Dolby Vision\n| 12.3-inch 3:2 (2736 x 1824) PixelSense LCD  \n**Processor** |  Apple A12X Bionic | Apple A12X Bionic | 8th-gen Intel Core\ni5/i7  \n**RAM** |  TBC | TBC | 8GB/16GB  \n**Rear camera** |  12-megapixels | 12-megapixels | 8-megapixels  \n**Front camera** |  7-megapixels | 7-megapixels | 5-megapixels  \n**Battery** |  29.3Wh (up to 10 hours of local video playback | 36.71Wh (up to\n10 hours of local video playback | 13.5 hours (of local video playback)  \n**Software** |  iOS 12.1 | iOS 12.1 | Windows 10  \n**Storage** |  64GB/256GB/512GB/1TB | 64GB/256GB/512GB/1TB |\n128GB/256GB/512GB/1TB  \n**Stylus** |  Apple Pencil 2 (sold separately) | Apple Pencil 2 (sold\nseparately) | Surface Pen (sold separately)  \n**Colours** |  Space Grey, Silver | Space Grey, Silver | Platinum, Black  \n  \nSoftware is where the Surface may well claw back credibility in this face off.\nApple’s new iPads, like any of the company’s mobile devices, run on iOS\n(version 12.1) and as such rely on the App Store for their applications. You\nget a more refined experience from Apple’s operating system and the apps that\nrun on it – all optimised for these tablet’s dimensions and specific hardware\nbut compared to the versatility of full Windows as a platform found running on\nthe Surface Pro 6, it’s hard to compete.\n\nMicrosoft’s Windows 10 still needs work when it comes to touch interaction but\nits infinitely more open as a platform and it more readily accommodates\nmultitasking and other power-user functions.\n\n## 2018 iPad Pro vs Surface Pro 6 – Which offers the best value for money?\n\nThe WiFi-only 11-inch iPad Pro starts at $799/£769, while the base 12.9-inch\nmodel starts at $999/£969. Microsoft’s Surface Pro 6 technically starts at\n$749, however, that price relates to a model that relies on a 7th-generation\nIntel Core m3 processor and that Microsoft doesn’t even advertise on its own\nwebsite (not to mention it’ll likely feel underpowered, paired with just 4GB\nof RAM). For the base Core i5 Surface Pro 6 that Microsoft sells directly,\nexpect to pay $899/£879.\n\nIf your wallet is bursting at the seams, the top-spec 1TB 12.9-inch 2018 iPad\nPro with cellular will set you back a hefty $1899/£1869, while the Core i7\nSurface Pro 6 with 1TB of storage and 16GB of RAM will cost you a whopping\n$2299/£2149.\n\nThe Microsoft Surface Pro 6 arrived in mid-October 2018, while the new 11 and\n12.9-inch 2018 iPad Pros are available to pre-order from today and hit stores\nin markets including the US and UK from November 7.\n\n**Apple’s new iPad Pro sports a wholly different focus to the Microsoft\nSurface Pro 6, so does that make it better?
