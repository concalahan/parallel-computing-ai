Of course, we’ve had iterative upgrades with [PS4\nPro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/ps4-pro) and [Xbox One\nX](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/xbox-one-x), but many are still\nwaiting for news of the next generation. Could we receive an announcement on\nsuch a thing soon? **\n\n_Trusted Reviews_ has compiled everything we know about PS5 including all the\nlatest news, rumours, potential specs and more.\n\n## PS5 news – Sony confirms new hardware is coming\n\nSony has confirmed the existence of the PS5! More specifically, Sony CEO\nKenichiro Yoshida told the [Financial\nTimes](https://www.ft.com/content/25f9a068-c898-11e8-ba8f-ee390057b8c9) that\nit is “necessary to have next-generation hardware.” The piece goes on to cite\nsources close to FT that say the new device “might not represent a major\ndeparture from the PS4, and that the fundamental architecture was similar.”\n\nSo there we have it, a next-generation console is likely in production at\nSony, although what it is and when we can expect it remains unknown. We\nimagine a reveal next year is possible with a release to come in the following\nmonths, although much will become clear in time.\n\n**Related:[Call of Duty Black Ops 4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/call-\nof-duty-black-ops-4-3373836) **\n\nPS4 and PS4 Pro continue to sell incredibly well and the system’s exclusive\nlibrary has plenty of support leading into 2019 with titles like [Days\nGone](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/days-gone-release-date-2993135), [\nThe Last of Us Part 2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/last-of-\nus-2-release-date-gameplay-trailer-pre-order-news-wishlist-2944236) and[ Death\nStranding](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/death-stranding-release-\ndate-2947317) still to come, so Sony will want to utilise the PS4 until the\nvery end of its lifespan, which now teeters on five years\n\nBethesda’s Pete Hines has also dropped some cryptic hints regarding the next\ngeneration, stating that the company is “privy” to a few things. In a recent\ninterview with [The\nTelegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/features/bethesdas-pete-hines-\nfallout-76-next-gen-elder-scrolls-6/), Hines said, “I’m privy to some stuff\nwhich obviously I can’t really talk about, but there is also a lot that I’m\nnot sure on what it’s going to look like. And more importantly how big a shift\nwe can expect.”\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n“How much of that will change [with the next consoles], I don’t know,” Hines\ncontinued. “The rest of it doesn’t matter to me because I’m not drawing art or\ncoding or designing.

The PS4\ncontinues not only to be the current best-selling console on the market but\none of the best sellers in history, so it makes sense to not announce a\nsuccessor yet.\n\nMicrosoft has come back swinging with Xbox One X, so the PS4 is no longer the\ndominant machine from a specs perspective. Logic would point to Sony having to\nrespond in some fashion.\n\n**Related:[PlayStation Mini](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/playstation-\nclassic-mini-release-date-preorder-3583798)  \n**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## PS5 Specs – How powerful will the PlayStation 5 be?\n\nAgain, without any announcements, we can’t fully assess what the PlayStation 5\nwill look like from a hardware perspective. We can, however, take a look at\nthe competition, and see how Sony will compete.\n\nLet’s take a look at the Xbox One X. It has an eight-core 2.3 GHz CPU, paired\nwith 12GB GDDR5 memory and a GPU sporting 40 compute units operating at\n1172MHz. In layman’s terms, this is a mid-range 2017 gaming PC, but with lots\nof clever software and hardware tricks to squeeze maximum performance out of\nit.\n\n**Related:[PS4 Pro vs PS4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ps4-pro-vs-\nps4-2941086)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAs is ever the case with console launches, manufacturers have to balance cost\nwith performance. The PS4 has been so wildly successful because it’s been able\nto offer better performance on third-party titles over [Xbox\nOne](https://www.trustedreviews.com/xbox-one-s-review).\n\nNow the balance of power is swinging in Microsoft’s favour (albeit with a more\nexpensive console), Sony will want to redress that and offer a console even\nmore powerful than the One X. Or perhaps Sony will be able to counter with a\nless powerful but better-value console come that woolly 2018 launch date.\n\n## PS5 Price – How much will it cost?\n\nAs we don’t even know its specs, we can’t accurately guess how much the\nPlayStation 5 will cost.\n\nThe Xbox One X currently retails for £450 or so. Knowing this, Sony will\nprobably aim for a similar price point if it hopes for its next console to\nremain competitive.\n\n## PS5 Backwards Compatibility – What can we expect?\n\nAt the launch of the PS4 Pro, system architect Mark Cerny clarified this was\nnot the start of a new console generation. “I believe in generations.\nGenerations are a good thing. So, philosophically, we believe in them. We\nbelieve they continue, and this is a mid-generation release,” he is quoted by\n[Gamasutra](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/283611/Inside_the_PlayStation_4_Pro_with_Mark_Cerny.php#tophead).\n\nSony was at pains to make sure consumers saw the PS4 Pro, a modest improvement\nover the base console, as a mid-cycle refresh.\n\nMicrosoft, meanwhile, sees the One X as the beginning of the end of console\ngenerations. Microsoft’s head of marketing, Aaron Greenberg, told Engadget “We\nthink the future is without console generations.”\n\nBoth with very different outlooks, but both doing something important:\nallowing players to carry over their game libraries.\n\n**Related:[Upcoming PS4 Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/upcoming-\nps4-games)  \n**\n\n**![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)**\n\nSony made a misstep in a lack of [PS4 backward\ncompatibility](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/ps4-backwards-\ncompatibility-can-you-play-ps3-games-on-ps4). Microsoft capitalised by\noffering extensive [Xbox One backward\ncompatibility](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/xbox-one-backwards-\ncompatibility-can-you-play-xbox-360-games-on-xbox-one) via consistent updates,\nwith new games added almost weekly.\n\nBoth Xbox One X and PS4 Pro, as they’re not fully fledged ‘next-gen’ consoles,\nplay all current and future Xbox One and PS4 titles respectively, but with\nimprovements over being played on base consoles.\n\nThe PlayStation 5 simply must offer backward compatibility so that all PS4\ngames work on the machine.\n\n## PS5 Games – What will we get?\n\n2017 has offered some of the [best PS4\ngames](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/ps4-games-3431751) the console has\nseen. So let’s look at which series are due a sequel and judge which titles\nmight be around at launch of a new console.\n\nWith the likes of [God of War](https://www.trustedreviews.com/god-of-war-\nps4-review), [The Last of Us Part 2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/the-\nlast-of-us-2-release-date-gameplay-trailer-pre-order-news-wishlist), [Spider-\nMan](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/spider-man-ps4-exclusive-insomniac-\ngames) closing out this generation, those series are pretty much locked down\nfor the foreseeable future. Plus with [Ratchet and\nClank](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/ratchet-and-clank), [Uncharted\n4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/uncharted-4-review), [Lost\nLegacy](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/uncharted-lost-legacy) and\n[Persona 5](https://www.trustedreviews.com/persona-5-review) all available\nnow, we wouldn’t be seeing those titles arriving with the PS5.\n\nIt’d be more likely we’d see brand-new IP with the new console, or a return of\nan old favourite like\n[Infamous](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/infamous-4-release-date-news-\nrumours-trailer-gameplay-characters-story) or the\n[Resistance](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/resistance-3-resistance-3-weapons-\nmove-and-multiplayer-page-2) series.\n\n## PS5 VR – Will we get a new headset?\n\n[PlayStation VR](https://www.trustedreviews.com/playstation-vr-review) has\nproven a big success for Sony. Even today it’s hard to find a headset in\nstores or online.\n\nIt also has a great library to support it, with new releases arriving on the\nPlayStation Store frequently for current owners of the headset.\n\n**Related:[Best PSVR Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-playstation-\nvr-games_round-up)  \n**\n\n**![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)**\n\nHowever, as a console VR headset, it naturally couldn’t match the power and\nfidelity of its [PC](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-pc-games_round-up)\ncounterparts. If the PS5 is significantly more powerful than the PS4, could we\nsee a hardware revision to offer a better virtual reality experience?\n\nIt would make sense, as Microsoft is planning on offering VR with the Xbox One\nX, though based on the company’s showing at E3 this won’t be a big push at\nall.\n\n_**What do you hope to see from the PS5?
