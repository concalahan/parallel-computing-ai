For example,\nif you have a cleaner who you wish to let into your house but only during\nspecific hours, you can assign a passcode to them that only lets them unlock\nthe door as designated times.\n\nThe lock can also be operated remotely through the Nest app, which when used\nin conjunction with the Nest Hello video doorbell gadget can allow for people\nto unlock the door from elsewhere once they have confirmed the identity of the\nperson who’s calling by.\n\nRunning off four replaceable AA batteries, the smart lock alerts its users\nwhen its getting low on power so that it doesn’t end up powering down and\neffectively locking them out of their home. The lock can also be accessed\nthrough a touchscreen pad in the Nest app should the lock’s power or Wi-Fi\nfail.\n\nTo protect from interference, both digital and physical, the two companies say\nthe Nest x Yale Lock has strong encryption and sports tough outer hardware to\nprevent burglars from bashing into it.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nIt also comes in three finishes: Polished Brass, Satin Nickel and Oil Rubbed\nBronze to fit the exterior aesthetics of your door or home.\n\nSlated for release in March 2018 and with pre-orders going live in February,\nthere’s no word yet on the price of the smart lock. But it does look like a\ndevice for people keen to add a finish touch to the smart home setup they have\nbeen building.\n\n**Related:[Best security cameras for your home\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-security-camera-wifi-wireless-\nsmart-home-monitor-pet-dog-cat)**\n\n**Would you trust a digital lock to take care of your home’s security?
