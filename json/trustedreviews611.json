The Google cars have an issue with heavy\nrain and snow. Very low sunlight is also very bad because the cameras don’t\nsee anything so you need to have some sort of controlled environment.\n\n“That makes it almost impossible to sell a 100% autonomous vehicle to an\naverage person.”\n\n**Related:[Apple Car news](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-car-news-\nrumours-driverless-price-release-date-electric)**\n\nIssues with test conditions are not the only thing holding mass-market fully\nautonomous cars back according to Mr van der Jagt.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nHe continued: “Production is a big question. If we have a fully autonomous\nvehicle it will not be a vehicle that a person can go out and buy and drive\nevery day under every condition.\n\n“We will have autonomous vehicles but the first set will be in certain\ngeographic areas, maybe California or somewhere else. You will have a shuttle\nservice that uses fully autonomous vehicles.”\n\nFord has been working on its own version of a self-driving car for some time,\nand recently announced it would be the first car maker to test autonomous\nvehicles at the University of Michgan’s simulated city, known as Mcity.\n\nThe company currently has four autonomous cars, all located in the US, and is\nplanning to expand the team at Mcity to ramp up testing in the coming years.\n\n**See also:[Christmas 2015 gift\nguide](https://www.trustedreviews.com/hubs/christmas)**\n\nBut, as Mr van der Jagt explained, it seems the first round of self-driving\ncars which Ford will put into production is likely to be aimed at providing an\nalternative to public transport.\n\nHe added: “I think in the next decade [self-driving cars] will happen. Whether\nthat’s 2020 or 2029, somewhere in that time frame you will see fully\nautonomous vehicles.\n\n“But the first wave will not be privately owned cars. With the amount of cars\nyou have on the road you learn more and more and you get better control over\nall conditions. It is possible then, that in our lifetime families will have\nthese cars.”\n\n"}
