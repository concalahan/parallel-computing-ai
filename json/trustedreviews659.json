It will support 5Gbps download speeds.”\n\nThe 5Gbps speeds is a big step up on current 4G networks, which in the UK\nstill haven’t even managed to break the 1Gbps barrier.\n\n5G is a next-generation networking technology that’s still in its infant\nstages, especially in Europe, where it isn’t expected to roll out until at\nleast 2020.\n\n**Related:[5G vs 4G: What’s the\ndifference?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/what-is-5g-a-rough-guide-\nto-the-next-generation-of-mobile-networks)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n###  Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\n## Explaining the Snapdragon X50 5G modem  \n\nQualcomm is one of many companies working to bring 5G to the masses. [Huawei\nreported](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/huawei-5g-download-speed-real-\nworld-release) successfully hitting 3.6Gbps download speeds in a 5G “field\ntrial” at the end of 2015, but the big question surrounding 5G is what wave-\nband companies should run the network on.\n\nHanna said Qualcomm achieved the 5Gbps speed by using a specialist type of\nband – one that the majority of telecoms companies have ignored.\n\n“The modem gets its speed, initially, by operating in the 28GHz millimeter\nwave band. This is a new spectrum that’s never been used for cellular services\nbefore. It operates at a much higher frequency range,” he explained.\n\n“The advantage [of that] is that it can provide a very wide bandwidth. So if\nyou look at the X16 LTE modem, the maximum bandwidth it supports is 80MHz, but\nthe X50 modem supports 800MHz of bandwidth. That’s how it gets the extreme\ndownload speeds.”\n\n![Snapdragon](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe millimeter wave spectrum was previously ignored, since it can’t reach long\ndistances, and it isn’t powerful enough to penetrate walls. Hanna said the\ncompany had to completely redesign the modem’s antenna system to overcome\nthese problems.\n\n“The antennas will look very different: instead of having two of four in the\nhandset, you’ll have an array of smaller antennas. They’re much smaller\nbecause of the spectrum they’re operating in, so instead of just a couple, we\nuse 16 or 24 or 32 antennas.\n\n“We then get them working together, so they can direct the energy of the\ntransmission to one direction or the other. This tech is called beamforming,\nor beamsteering,” he said.\n\nHanna added: “If we can direct the energy, we can play tricks such as bouncing\nit off walls. The mobile device with the X50 modem can direct the energy to\nbounce and go round corners. We’ve demonstrated it successfully in our\nprototypes. Now we plan to bring it to integrated circuits.”\n\nHe also noted that mobile devices with the X50 will be able to switch between\n4G if a 5G signal isn’t available.\n\nHanna didn’t specify which OEMs will use the 5G modem, but promised the first\ncommercial devices with it will hit the Korean and US markets in the first-\nhalf of 2018.\n\n## 4G’s also getting some love\n\nAt the same event, Qualcomm confirmed it will be releasing the first range of\nconsumer devices running its X16 LTE modem by the end of the year. The X16 was\nannounced at the start of 2016 and, according to Qualcomm, is the first 1Gbps\nspeed mobile modem.\n\nThe tech will initially launch in Australia as a part of a joint project\nbetween Qualcomm, Telstra, Ericsson and Netgear.\n\n“The Netgear Mobile Router LR1100 supports gigabit speeds and will be rolled\nout by Telstra to leading customers in the next few months,” Hanna told us.\n\nHanna didn’t disclose if, or when, the tech would be rolled out to the mass\nmarket, but did confirm it will make an appearance in the company’s next\nflagship Snapdragon 800 series mobile CPU. He said: “In 2017, there will be\ngigabit connectivity on smartphones. We also expect that there will be several\n1Gbps network launches.”\n\nHanna didn’t offer any specific information on when Qualcomm expects the 4G\nupgrade to arrive in the UK.\n\n**Related:[Best Android Smartphones 2016](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-\nandroid-phones-1_round-up)**\n\n**Watch The Refresh: The best tech gossip and reviews every week**\n\n**What do you think of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X50 modem?
