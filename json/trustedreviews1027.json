The 42mm size is on the smaller sideand the watch sits close to the wrist. You can pick up it in various metalfinishes, including stainless steel and titanium, and there are differentstrap options too. The version I tried had a buckled leather strap that feltsoft and luxurious.This premium finish extends to the 1.2-inch OLED display too, which is coveredin sapphire crystal for improved scratch resistance.## **Opening impressions**The promise of watches powered by Qualcomm’s Wear 3100 is great, especiallythe improvements to battery life, however, the high price of the Summit 2means it’s only for those who really want that luxurious finish and a designerlabel.It doesn’t necessarily do anything other watches running this chipset won’t beable to do, but it does look and feel great."}
