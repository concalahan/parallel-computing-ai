It combines exhilarating\ncombat, poignant storytelling and an infectious sense of madness in a way only\nthis medium can. Kazuma Kiryu’s lovable Japanese charm spent years failing to\npenetrate outside of his homeland, but now the series has taken on a new lease\nof life with Yakuza 6, the final chapter in the Dragon of Dojima story.\n\nAnd I’m happy to report that it’s spectacular, pushing the series to new\nheights without abandoning what made it so special in the first place. By that\nI mean you can still clobber 20 thugs before scoffing ramen and hitting up the\nlocal cat cafe.\n\n**Related:[Yakuza 6 – The cheapest places to\nbuy](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/yakuza-6-wheres-cheapest-\nbuy-3451864)**\n\nIn Yakuza 6 you once again play as Kazuma Kiryu. The seasoned yakuza is now an\nordinary citizen, hoping to serve a brief prison sentence before retiring to\nthe peaceful island of Okinawa. Everything is going swimmingly until Haruka,\nhis adoptive daughter, finds herself in critical condition following a tragic\ncar accident. This sets off a chain of events that cover everything from\nintimate family disputes to government conspiracies.\n\nKiryu’s swansong concludes with a final act that’s arguably the series’ finest\nhour yet, presenting encounters and narrative revelations that bring with them\nthe shock and emotional gratification you’d expect from a feature film. This\nis thanks to a fantastic cast and sharp localisation effort that translates\nthe original Japanese without sacrificing any of the gravitas. Past entries\nhave garnered criticism as a result of removing such elements, so it’s great\nto see everything untouched here.\n\nYou can relax if you’re a new player afraid of being washed away by waves of\nlore. Yakuza 6 comes with a reminisce tool that allows you to relive the\nnarrative of each game and familiarise yourself with key characters. While I’d\nstill recommend playing past games for maximum impact, this offers a great way\nfor newcomers to dive into a world that requires much dedication in order to\nbecome fully immersed.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n**Related:**[ **Upcoming PS4\nGames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/upcoming-ps4-games)\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nKazuma Kiryu’s climactic tale takes him to two distinct cities: Kamurocho and\nHiroshima. The former is the Red Light District envisioned by the series since\nits inception. The general layout remains the same, meaning returning players\nwill feel at home while eager to discover what’s changed amongst the bustling\nboulevards and alleyways.\n\nSEGA should be commended for making the town of Kamurocho feel constantly\nexciting with each new entry. To me, it’s an old haunt that keeps up with the\ntimes, whether it be through new arcades or citizens idling on the roadside.\nYakuza 6 proves that there are many more stories to tell in this world; it’s\nnever grown tiresome to traverse.\n\nMuch of this is due to a new gameplay engine that feels fantastic. Loading\nscreens are a thing of the past, as Kiryu transitions seamlessly into battles\nand buildings. Spotting a group of rebellious thugs across the street and\nsurprising them with a flurry of punches never gets old, especially when you\ncan take the action to nearby establishments in the same seamless fashion.\n\nWhile much of your time will be spent in Kamurocho, Hiroshima cements itself\nas an equally memorable location that I came to love. Acting as the backdrop\nto a sprawling harbour, it provides a stark juxtaposition to Kamurocho. Having\nvisited the locations that inspired both, the accuracy to their real-world\ncounterparts is something to behold. If you’ve never had the chance to visit\nJapan, Yakuza is a virtual alternative that lets you experience the sights and\nsounds like no other game out there.\n\n**Related:[Call of Duty Black Ops 4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/call-\nof-duty-black-ops-4-news-release-date-gameplay-wishlist-treyarch-3373836)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSince there’s only one playable character, the combat system in Yakuza 6 has\nbeen streamlined against previous entries. Kiryu has a single fighting style\nthat can be upgraded with a range of skills. At first, I was worried this\nwould grow tiresome, but towards the end of my playthrough, I had yet to\nexperience everything it had to offer.\n\nIt feels like SEGA has trimmed back some of the unnecessary fat of previous\nentries. While I do miss the ability to craft my own weapons, the environment\nis littered with so many tools of destruction that you’re never left empty-\nhanded. If random encounters aren’t to your liking, you can purchase equipment\nthat will cause enemies to avoid you, although walking right up to them will\nstill trigger a fight.\n\nThe potential monotony of battle is kept at bay by Heat Actions. These\nbrilliant acts of ultra-violence are committed by hitting the triangle button\nwhen your Heat Gauge is full, causing Kiryu to unleash a devastating flurry of\nattacks. It’s a joy to watch them unfold, and they change depending on where\nyou are in the world and the weapons you’re carrying. New variants are\nunlocked with experience points, so there’s often a new display of brutality\nto look forward to.\n\nOne of my only complaints with combat is that things feel a bit too easy at\ntimes. If you’re one to concentrate on side activities then you’ll have enough\nexperience to squash even the greatest of enemies. Yakuza 6 has a few\ndifficulty settings, so it’s best played on the higher options if you’re after\nboth challenge and a spectacle.\n\n**Related:[Ni No Kuni 2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/ni-no-\nkuni-2-revenant-kingdom) **\n\n**![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)**\n\nYakuza 6 isn’t all about combat, although it will more than likely surface in\nsubstories – the game’s equivalent of side quests. These can involve chasing a\nroomba throughout town, fighting ghosts in a graveyard, or helping an upcoming\nvlogger become a viral sensation. Kiryu stumbles upon these while exploring\nand they’re a distraction well worth seeking out. Not only for valuable\nexperience points, but references and micro-narratives that are worth the\ninvestment.\n\nThe usual assortment of mini-games found across Kamurocho is equally as deep\nin Yakuza 6, with some worthy of individual arcade releases. Club SEGA is\npopulated with full versions of Outrun, Space Harrier and Virtua Fighter 5,\nwhich transport you into an emulated environment that feels lovingly\nauthentic. Sadly, I didn’t notice any UFO Catchers during my time with Yakuza\n6, abandoning a series tradition of catching cute fluffy toys.\n\nClan Creator is the most significant side activity presented by Yakuza 6. Upon\narriving in Hiroshima, Kiryu is scouted by a group of young gang members\nlooking to abolish a mysterious organisation known as JUSTIS. The faction\nhappens to be helmed by actual professional wrestlers such as Kazuchika Okada\nand Tetsuya Naito. The bulk of this mode consists of a simplistic RTS of\nsorts, where you send out a variety of troops to dispatch enemies.\n\nYou’ll be responsible for assembling a hierarchy of soldiers while recruiting\nleaders to fight on the frontlines, all of whom have unique abilities acting\nas buffs or devastating attacks. There was an undeniable charm to facing off\nagainst famous faces before bringing them over to my cause, even if the mode\nitself didn’t pose much of a challenge beyond a few climactic battles. But,\nfor what is essentially an optional part of a huge package, it’s more than\nsufficient.\n\n**Related:**[ **Yakuza Kiwami 2**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/yakuza-\nkiwami-2-everything-know-far-3274568)\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe tonal balance on display between the core narrative and sidestories is a\nsight to behold, and further testament to how compelling this world can be. I\nmean, past entries have seen Kiryu fighting tigers and launching himself\nacross skyscrapers. Yakuza 6 acknowledges this excess of ridiculousness at\nevery turn, yet it never softens dramatic moments that continue to leave a\npunch time and time again.\n\n## VERDICT\n\nYakuza 6: The Song of Life is a wonderful crime thriller that embraces\neverything that made the series great, refining it further with new technology\n– it blew me away. I’m not ashamed to say that the closing minutes of Kazuma\nKiryu’s final chapter brought me to tears, acting as the culmination of a\nstory in which I’ve lost myself for more than a decade.\n\n**Order Yakuza 6: Song of Life from**[ **Amazon UK**](http://amzn.to/2oOUKTe)\n\nDon’t let this legacy dissuade you, though. Yakuza 6 is perfectly suited for\nnewcomers thanks to its excellent reminisce feature alongside combat and\nexploration that’s easily the series’ best yet. Combine this with a deep,\nengaging story and Yakuza 6 offers an experience I can’t recommend enough.\n\n## Score\n\n  \n\n"}
