The car which is set to rival\nBMW’s 3-series, has a rumoured price tag of around $35,000 (about £22k).\n\nDuring the company’s earnings call the entrepreneur said: “We are hoping to\nshow the Model 3 in March of next year.”\n\nThat purported pricetag is around half the price of the Tesla Model S, which\nstarts at $70,000, while the Model X SUV is expected to cost around the same\nwhen it arrives later this year.\n\nThe Model 3, which can run for 200 miles on a single charge and is 20 per cent\nsmaller than the Model S, will be attainable for a more mainstream audience\nseeking to lower their carbon footprint.\n\nHowever, it’s still going to be a while before drivers will be able to obtain\nthe Model 3, with Musk claiming production will begin at the end of 2017.\n\n**Read more:**[ **What is Tesla Powerwall**  \n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/tesla-powerwall-explained-the-home-\nbattery-to-spark-an-energy-revolution)  \nElsewhere during the earnings call, Musk revealed the company had taken a\nwhopping [38,000 pre-orders for the Powerwall home\nbattery](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/tesla-powerwall-gets-38-000-pre-\norders) solution, announced last week.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n“The response has been overwhelming.
