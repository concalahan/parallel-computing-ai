Interactive Entertainment have confirmed\nthat Sean Bean will be making an appearance in**[ **Hitman\n2**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/hitman-2) **.**\n\nThe star of films such as National Treasure and Silent Hill: Revelations will\nbe taking on the role of an elusive target in Agent 47’s latest outing.\n\nThis means he will have his own distinct mission as you have only one chance\nto assassinate him within a strict time limit. One mistake and it’s all over.\n\n“I’m thrilled to be a part of the upcoming HITMAN™ 2 video game,” said Bean,\n“It’s always exciting to take on a new role, and I look forward to seeing my\ncharacter in action when the Elusive Target mission launches.”\n\nSean Bean will play a character known as Mark Faba, a former MI5 agent turned\nruthless freelance assassin. He even has a cool nickname: ‘The Undying.’ Famed\nfor being killed in almost every role he’s in, the name seems ironically\nfitting.\n\n**Related:**[ **Best Xbox One\nGames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/xbox-one-games-3435271)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nIO Interactive has said that the Sean Bean update will be the first of many\nfree content drops for the upcoming stealth adventure, which launches on\nNovember 13 for PS4, Xbox One and PC.\n\nGames editor Jake Tucker was a huge fan of the 2016 reboot, and came away from\na recent preview event feeling equally positive about the sequel:\n\n‘Hitman’s episodic turn may not have been hugely successful for the company,\nbut it showed the fanbase that the optimal way to play in this collection of\nassassination sandboxes is to digest it slowly, mulling over each individual\nhunt until you’ve mastered it.’\n\n**Are you excited to murder Sean Bean in Hitman 2?
