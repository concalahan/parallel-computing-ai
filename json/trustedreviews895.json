Launched in Sony’s native Japan, plans for a broader\nXperia Z4 release look unlikely, at least in its current guise.**\n\nWith the wider world waiting with expectation for the eagerly-awaited [LG\nG4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/lg-g4-review) rival, the Z4 has shunned the\nwestern world, with the little improved [Sony Xperia\nZ3+](https://www.trustedreviews.com/sony-xperia-z3-1-review) taking its place.\n\nHaving long been tipped as one of the standard-setting flagships of this\nyear’s smartphone race, the Sony Xperia Z4 was given a low-key introduction.\nDespite the lack of fanfare, the handset is being pitted against the recently\nintroduced [Samsung Galaxy S6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-\ngalaxy-s6-review) and [HTC One M9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/htc-\none-m9-review) for smartphone supremacy.\n\nDespite having been widely expected to adopt a QHD display, Sony has once\nagain shunned the [LG G3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/lg-g3-review) and\n[Samsung Galaxy Note 4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-\nnote-4-review) rivalling tech in favour of a more traditional 5.2-inch, 1080p\nFull HD panel.\n\nScreen disappointments aside, the Sony Xperia Z4 features a number of small\nimprovements over its predecessor. Having adopted a more powerful, 64-bit\nSnapdragon 810 processor, the handset has also been bestowed with a slimmer,\n6.9mm form and a smaller battery.\n\nContradicting countless rumours, the Z4’s camera hasn’t been improved either.\nThe phone has been bestowed with the same 20.7-megapixel sensor as the Z3. It\nhad previously been suggested the phone would make use of the company’s new\nIMX230 camera sensor. Google’s latest [Android 5.0\nLollipop](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/android-5-0-l-features-list-\nwhat-s-new) OS powers the Z4 direct from the box.\n\n_We will continue to update this page with all the latest Sony Xperia  \n  \nZ4 release date details, news, leaks and rumours as details emerge.  \n  \nBookmark it now to keep on top of all things Xperia Z4._\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n**Looking for a new phone?

The\nphone is currently available in the company’s native Japan, with the wider\nworld being given the cold shoulder.\n\nAlthough there is currently no word as to when, or indeed if, the iterative\nupdate will make it to UK shores, given the Z4’s flagship status, we would be\nhighly surprised if it failed to touch down internationally in the coming\nmonths – at least in some capacity.\n\nStill, Sony is remaining tight-lipped as to exactly when the Xperia Z4 release\ndate will be held. Given that the [iPhone\n6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/iphone-6-review) rivalling Z3+ has just been\ndebuted, further confusion now surrounds the device.\n\nSony’s desire to push new phones out before current models have had chance to\nfully hit their stride suggested that the Xperia Z4 would go global during the\nfirst half of the year. Now, however, a September, IFA-based international\nrelease is looking more likely.\n\n![Sony Xperia\nZ4](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nFurther hinting that we could see it’s next flagship phone soon, Sony has also\ninformed _TrustedReviews_ that the handset might touch down a little later\nthan last year’s model.\n\n“Z4 is the next-generation of product that we’ll be announcing,” Tim Harrison,\nSony’s Vice President of Global Communications and PR, told us recently.\n\nAlthough failing to confirm exactly when the phone will be introduced, he told\nus to expect the Xperia Z4 to drop sooner rather than later.\n\n“No, we haven’t [moved to a more traditional 12 month product cycle],” he told\nus. “As a general rule you will see some adjustment to the way we phase our\nproducts.”\n\nAlthough having pushed its premature refreshes in the past, the Z4 could be\nSony’s last attempt at a six month smartphone cycle.\n\nDiscussing the company’s rushed updates recently, MacDougall stated: “This\nmight not necessarily be something we continue in the long term, but for now,\nin the beginning of the Z series, we believe we can bring experiences which\nare fresh and new and relevant, and justify for the consumer buying a new\nproduct.”\n\nDespite the seeming inevitability of the Z4’s global arrival, it has been\nsuggested that the device will remain exclusive to the company’s native land.\n\nInstead, with the Z3+ now a thing of reality, a reworked, QHD display packing\nZ4 is expected later in the year. ****\n\nWe will continue to update this post as and when more concrete launch plans\nare revealed.  \n **** **  \nRead More:[Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Release Date, Rumours, News, Specs and\nPrice](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-5-release-date-\nrumours-news-specs-and-price)**\n\n![Sony Xperia\nZ4](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Sony Xperia Z4 News\n\nSony needs its next smartphone to be a consumer hit. The Z3 gained critical\nacclaim but that didn’t stop Sony Mobile haemorrhaging money in 2014.\n\nRecent financial earnings reports have seen the manufacturer forced to revise\nits smartphone sales forecast. Having previously predicted it would shift 43\nmillion devices during the year, this figure has since been slashed to just\n41m. Sony has claimed this drop is due to lack of presence in markets such as\nthe US and China.\n\nWith longstanding head Kunimasa Suzuki having lost his job, former VP Hiroki\nTotoki has been promoted to head honcho.\n\nAccording to early reports, however, the phone isn’t shaping up as a winner,\nwith the world’s leading secret agent, James Bond, having reportedly turned\nhis nose up at the device.\n\nDespite substantial financial backing, a leaked email, sent by Columbia\nPictures’ Andrew Gumpert, has revealed that Bond actor Daniel Craig and\ndirector Sam Mendes don’t think particularly highly of the new Sony Xperia Z4.\n\n“BEYOND the $$ factor, there is, as you may know, a CREATIVE factor whereby\nSam and Daniel don’t like the Sony phone for the film (the thinking,\nsubjectively/objectively is that James Bond only uses the ‘best,’ and in their\nminds, the Sony phone is not the ‘best’),” the message read.\n\nAdding to the company’s woes, a series of Xperia Z4 images were leaked via the\nhigh-profile Sony hack.\n\nBizarrely, the shots were not stolen from the design labs, but emailed between\ntwo high-level execs trying to hash out a product placement deal in the\nupcoming James Bond film, Spectre.\n\n“Sony Mobile has now provided us with the needed visuals of the new Z4\nphones,” Sony’s Executive Vice President of Consumer Marketing, George Leon,\nstated in the leaked emails.\n\nSuggesting the Z4 could be backed up by an autumn spin-off, in the messages\nsent to Sony CEO Michael Lynton he added: “These phones are the planned phones\nfor May/November of 2015. I’m attaching the visual for you to see.”\n\nAlthough offering no details on the phone’s specs, the leaked images suggested\nthe second Z4 will pair a minimalist bezel with a 1.2mm glass boarder.\n\nAccording to the leaks, the Z4 – which looks markedly similar to its\npredecessors – will be joined by a secondary, spin-off handset later in the\nyear. It is expected this device, which will feature a slightly remodelled\ndesign, will act as a direct tie-in to the upcoming Bond flick.\n\n**Related:[iPhone 6S Release Date, Rumours, News, Specs and\nPrice](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-6s-release-date-rumours-\nnews-specs-and-price)**\n\n![Sony Xperia\nZ4](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Sony Xperia Z4 Rumours\n\nThe Xperia Z4 might be Sony’s latest flagship, but it is not expected to lead\nthe field on its own for long. A series spin-off devices have already been\ntipped for launch.\n\nFrom the oversized Xperia Z4 Ultra to the pocketable Z4 Compact, the phone is\nexpected to be just one of a new breed of devices from the Japanese\nmanufacuter.\n\nThe company has already extended the Z4 family, with the iPad-rivalling Sony\nXperia Z4 Tablet launching ahead of its smartphone sibling at MWC 2015.\n\nThere’s also talk of a [Sony Xperia Z4 Walkman\nedition](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/sony-xperia-z4-walkman-edition-\nreportedly-in-the-works)  \n  \nbeing in the works. The music-focused variant would boast a  \n  \ntrimmed-down 4-inch display, but rock S-Force Pro front-firing speakers  \n  \npaired with Sony’s S-Master digital amplifier.\n\n**Read More:[LG G4 Release Date, Rumours, News, Specs and\nPrice](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-g4-release-date-rumours-news-\nspecs-and-price)**\n\n![Xperia\nZ3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Sony Xperia Z4 Specs\n\nThe Sony Xperia Z4 specs sheet sees the handset line up as a market-leading\ndevice. It’s not exactly a ground-breaking one, however.\n\nYes, the phone has added an improved processor, a slimmer body and new\noperating system, but there is little to separate the Z4 from the throng of\nhigh-profile Android handsets already on the market.\n\nVisually, the Z4 looks almost identical to its past siblings. The  \n  \ncompany’s Omnibalance design principles have been maintained, with a few  \n  \nnew twists thrown into the mix.\n\nLarger stereo speakers and an  \n  \nun-capped charging port are the only major design differences to a  \n  \ndevice which otherwise appears to be a near carbon copy of its  \n  \npredecessor. The phone’s front-facing camera has also switched locations  \n  \nwith the integrated light sensor, moving to the left of the face Sony  \n  \nlogo.\n\nAgain, like its predecessor, the Sony Xperia Z4 has shunned a QHD display in\nfavour of a 5.2-inch, 1080p Full HD offering.\n\nAlthough  \n  \na QHD panel would have seen Sony keep pace with latest industry trends,  \n  \nit goes against recent comments made by the company. Addressing\n_TrustedReviews_ ,  \n  \nMacDougall said the firm had overlooked a 2K panel as, not only would  \n  \nit have a negative effect on battery life, but the visual benefits are  \n  \nnot there.\n\n“If we think of this size of screen, even up to  \n  \n8-inches, they are relatively small screens and it is very difficult for  \n  \nthe human eye to discern the difference between 2K and Full HD,” the  \n  \nXperia head told us.\n\nHe added: “If we believe that a key part  \n  \nof the user experience for consumers is to have a longer term battery,  \n  \nand if we believe we can deliver a great screen with Full HD and our  \n  \nSony technologies, we don’t believe the trade-off between  \n  \nhaving a 2K screen and battery consumption is the right  \n  \ntrade-off for a consumer.”\n\nWith the Galaxy S6  \n  \nhaving now adopted a QHD panel of its own, it appears Sony can only  \n  \navoid the move for so long. Early Xperia Z5 rumours have pegged a 2K  \n  \ndisplay as making an appearance.\n\nAs with the phone’s visuals, the Z4’s imaging abilities haven’t been\ndramatically updated either.\n\nLike  \n  \non the Z3, the Sony Xperia Z4 features a 20.7-megapixel primary camera.  \n  \nThis impressive, f/2.0 snapper snapper benefits from the company’s  \n  \nExmor RS and Bionz image processing credentials.\n\nUp front a  \n  \n5.1-megapixel selfie shooter makes the cut, with the 25mm wide-angle  \n  \nlens hosting camera boasting its own image stabilisation abilities.\n\nSadly,  \n  \nthe phone has overlooked Sony’s latest Exmor RS IMX230 imaging sensor.  \n  \nThis smartphone-bound camera addition is a 21-megapixel sensor which  \n  \noffers enhanced colour management over past models.\n\nThe first  \n  \nCMOS sensor to be built for smartphones, this sensor should take mobile  \n  \nimaging closer to DSLR quality shots for the first time. 192-point  \n  \nauto-focus detection is also on the cards alongside built-in image plane  \n  \nphase detection.\n\nIn terms of power, the phone features Qualcomm’s latest 64-bit, octa-core\nSnapdragon 810 chipset. The bigLITTLE processor offers oodles of power, but\nhas been the subject of serious overheating concerns since launch.\n\nThe is partnered with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage, expandable via\nmicroSD. Google’s latest Android 5.0 Lollipop OS is also present.\n\nOther differences are a case of little and littler. The phone has been made\nthinner – just 6.9mm slim to be precise – while the battery has shrunk from a\n3100mAh to a 2930mAh offering.\n\n**Related:[iPad Pro Release Date, Rumours, News, Specs and\nPrice](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ipad-pro-12-9-release-date-\nconcepts-stylus-specs-and-rumours)**\n\n![Sony Xperia\nZ3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Sony Xperia Z4 Price\n\nGiven the phone’s array of high-end components, don’t expect the Xperia Z4 to\nbe easy on your wallet. The Z3 launched in late 2014 with a £525 SIM-free\nprice tag. As such, we don’t expect the Z4 will be any cheaper.\n\nWith the [iPhone 6 Plus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/iphone-6-plus-review)\nand Samsung Galaxy Note 4 both already costing wannabe owners northwards of\n£600, we wouldn’t be surprised to see the Z4 edge closer to this more costly\nmilestone.\n\n**What would you like to see included on the Sony Xperia Z4?
