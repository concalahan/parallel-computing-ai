It will arrive with a 1,440 x 2,880,\n5.99-inch display, Blass reckons. It’ll have an 18:9 ratio with an edge-to-\nedge display, he says.\n\nThat’ll be paired with the Kirin 970 SoC and 6GB of RAM, putting the phone up\nthere with some of the recent Android flagships.\n\n**Related:[Huawei P10\nreview](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/huawei-p10)**\n\nThe impressive feature list continues with a 4,000mAh battery tipped by the\nreport, but still able to retain a 7.5mm thickness.\n\nThe leaker-in-chief (reporting for [Venture\nBeat](https://venturebeat.com/2017/09/08/huawei-mate-10-alps-and-blanc-\nvariants-detailed/)) also touts a 12/20-megapixel dual camera system with\noptical image stabilization and a f/1.6 aperture.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nAs with the previous generation phone, the system has been co-developed with\nLeica. On the front of the device there’ll be an 8-megapixel sensor.\n\nBlass reckons it’ll be out in December packing Android Oreo, which is likely\nto make it one of the first to arrive with the new OS out of the box.\n\n### What about Alps?\n\nWhen it comes to Alps, the report says there’ll be a slightly smaller\n5.88-inch display with the same resolution, but a 16:9 aspect ratio.\n\nThe battery, processor and camera set up are all exactly the same, according\nto Blass. Alps will arrive as soon as October 16, he says.\n\nAccording to Blass this could be the Mate 10 Lite. That would make the\npreviously-spied Marcel codename the regular Huawei Mate 10.\n\nEarlier this week [mocked-up\nrenders](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/huawei-mate-10-renders-show-the-\nreturn-of-the-home-button-3280772) showed the devices may have a physical home\nbutton/fingerprint sensor.\n\n**Will you be snapping up the Huawei Mate 10 or a variant later this year?\nWill Android Oreo seal the deal for you?
