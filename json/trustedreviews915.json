How do they\ncompare? Let’s take a closer look at the Mate 20 Pro vs Galaxy Note 9.**\n\nThe Mate 20 Pro and Note 9 are two big phones with powerful internals,\nimpressive camera arrays, and price-tags that’ll likely make you baulk. Not\nsure which one is right for you? With both super-sized smartphones now on the\nmarket, we examine the Mate 20 Pro vs Galaxy Note 9’s specs and dissect the\nkey differences to help you decide.\n\n## **Huawei Mate 20 Pro vs Galaxy Note 9: Big specs, even bigger displays**\n\nHuawei has certainly taken a lot of inspiration from Samsung for its latest\nphone. The Mate 20 curves like the Note 9, sandwiching a metal rim between two\npanels of glass. Both look great and feel very modern with a thin bezel and\nvarying colour options.\n\nBoth also use [OLED](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/oled-vs-led-\nlcd-2924602) for their displays, meaning excellent contrast and proper support\nfor [HDR](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/hdr-tv-high-dynamic-\ntelevision-explained-2927035) playback. These are two gorgeous panels that are\nperfect for viewing snaps or watching videos. And at 6.4-inches (Note 9) and\n6.39-inches (Mate 20 Pro) they are very similar in size.\n\n![Samsung Galaxy Note 9\nfortnite](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nOne big difference is the addition of a notch on the Mate 20’s display. This\nsmall display cutout allows for a thin bezel, but juts out slightly into the\nscreen. Personally, we’d take the extra bezel and lose the notch.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nTucked inside the Mate 20 Pro’s OLED panel is an in-display fingerprint\nsensor, replacing the traditional rear-mounted sensor you’ll find on the Note\n9. Both phones share facial unlocking though, with the Mate 20 Pro using 3D\ndepth sensing and the Note 9 authenticating via your retinas.\n\n**Related:[Best phablets](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nphablets)**\n\nNeither phone is short on power, even though the Mate 20 Pro uses a newer\nchipset. That’s the 7nm Kirin 980 as opposed to the 10nm Snapdragon 845/Exynos\n9810 Samsung has used since the [Galaxy\nS9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9). Having a 7nm\nchipset allows for more transistors to be placed inside, giving you better\nperformance in a more efficient package. RAM is 6GB for both (version with 8GB\nare available) and storage begins at 128GB. Interestingly, only the Note 9 has\nmicroSD support with Huawei instead using its own nano SD cards here.\n\n![Huawei Mate 20\nPro](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nBig phones tend to have big batteries and that’s certainly the case here.\nSamsung has packed a 4000 mAh cell inside the Note 9, with Huawei upping that\nslightly to 4200 mAh. Both have wireless charging and fast charging via USB\ntoo. The Mate 20 should charge faster, thanks to the 40w plug inside the box.\nHuawei claims you’ll get 70% charge in just over 30 minutes, which is a lot\nthan we got with the Note 9.\n\n**Related:[Mate 20 vs P20 Pro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/huawei-\nmate-20-pro-vs-huawei-p20-pro-3605995)**\n\nBoth Huawei and Samsung have struggled with getting quick Android updates out\nin the past and if you pick up the Note 9 today it’ll still have Android 8.1\non it. Pick up a Mate 20 Pro and you’ll find Android 9 Pie, even if it covered\nin EMUI.\n\n## **Huawei Mate 20 Pro vs Galaxy Note 9: A clear focus on the camera**\n\nOn the back of the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 there are two cameras, with the Mate\n20 Pro packing three.\n\nLet’s talk about the Mate 20 Pro first, as it’s arguably the more interesting\ndevice in terms of camera. The main sensor is 40-megapixels with an f/1.8\naperture; with a 20-megapixel ultrawide and 8-megapixel telephoto flanking it.\nThe camera itself uses a lot of AI-smarts and will alter your snaps dependant\non the surroundings. This AI is also used for stabilisation and we’re\nexpecting great things as a similar system worked fantastically well on the\nHuawei P20 Pro.\n\n**Related:[Best smartphones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nsmartphone-3431175)**\n\n![Huawei Mate 20 Pro\ncamera](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAround the front the Mate 20 Pro has a 24-megapixel camera along with a depth\nsensor.\n\nThe two cameras on the back of the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 comprise of a main\n12-megapixel dual-pixel sensor with an aperture that can shift between f/1.5\nand f/2.4 and a 12-megapixel telephoto sensor. In terms of selfies the Note 9\nhas an 8-megapixel camera.\n\nWe love the variety of the Mate 20 and having an ultrawide sensors is great\nfor cramming loads into a shot. Huawei has also included the excellent Night\nMode from the P20 Pro, which took excellent low-light shots on Huawei’s\nprevious flagship. We’ve yet to put the Mate 20 Pro through our review process\nso we’re not sure how it will compare to the Galaxy Note 9.\n\nWe do know that the Note 9 takes great snaps, with that typical punch of\ncolour we expect from Samsung’s phones.\n\n![Samsung Galaxy Note 9\nback](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nBoth phones shoot video at 4K and boast plenty of pro modes inside the camera\napps.\n\n## **Huawei Mate 20 Pro vs Galaxy Note 9: Neither is priced as a budget\noption**\n\nPacked with so many features, it’s hardly a surprise neither of phones are\ncheap. The iPhone X started the near £1000/$1000 phone and both of these\ndevices have followed suit. The Samsung Galaxy Note 9 starts at £899/$999 and\nthe Mate 20 Pro costs £899/1049 euros.\n\nBoth are currently available to buy in the UK, US, and elsewhere – though\nshipping dates may vary by retailer or network.\n\n**So, Huawei Mate 20 Pro or Samsung Galaxy Note 9?
