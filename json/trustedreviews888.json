The answer is: it couldn’t. The\nbenchmark had to be fake.\n\nAfter doing a little digging, we, together with the folks over at _SamMobile_\n, found a number of\n[discrepancies](https://www.sammobile.com/2017/11/14/galaxy-s9-plus-\ngeekbench/) in the filing, the most notable being that the Processor\nIdentifier is representative of a SoC used on the Galaxy Note 5 and Galaxy S6.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThat, coupled with the fact the Galaxy S9 Plus scored tremendously lower than\nboth the [Galaxy S8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s8)\nand Galaxy S8 Plus in the benchmark, can be considered confirmation that the\ninformation has, in fact, been falsified.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nBut if that isn’t enough to convince you, maybe this will.\n\nWe uncovered an identical Geekbench\n[listing](https://browser.geekbench.com/v4/cpu/3431561), which dates back to\nJuly. _Sure_ , there’s a chance a prototype could have been functional back\nthen, but it would have been impossible for it to have been running Android\n8.0 Oreo, as the filing states.\n\nA handset had to have been tampered with to generate the result – and it isn’t\noverly difficult to do. There are a number of applications available for\nrooted Android smartphones that let you alter system information.\n\nThe moral of the story? Don’t believe everything you read online.\n\n**Are you looking forward to the Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9 Plus? Do you think\nthey will ship with at least 6GB of RAM?
