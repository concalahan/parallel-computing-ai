Here’s everything you need\nto know about mixed reality, including the headsets, software and games you’ll\nbe experiencing when it launches.**\n\n## What is Mixed Reality?\n\nMixed reality, despite being a new term, is actually already a bit of an\nanachronism. You might imagine it as being just [Microsoft’s\nHoloLens](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/hololens-release-date-news-\nand-price-2922378) platform, which overlays virtual content onto your real-\nworld vision using some extremely expensive glasses, but the company has\nexpanded mixed reality to include an entire brand of virtual reality hardware\nand software.\n\nHoloLens is only being used by businesses for some very niche functions, such\nas architecture, so for the rest of us mixed reality, for now at least, means\nvirtual reality with a flip-up screen.\n\nMicrosoft has handed over the blueprints for its mixed reality headsets to its\nOEM (original equipment manufacturers) partners, the same people who make\nlaptops running Windows 10. So far, we’ve seen headsets from Dell, HP, Lenovo,\nAcer and Asus. They all feature near-identical specifications and form\nfactors, and cost all about the same. They are also all compatible with the\nsame set of controllers prescribed by Microsoft.\n\nFrom the demos we’ve seen so far from Microsoft’s partners, we’ve experienced\nsome fairly basic uses for the headsets, including walking around a virtual\nhome (known as Cliff House) with Windows 10 apps plastered to the walls, as\nwell as exploring Machu Pichu from a hot-air balloon.\n\nWhat’s common across all the experiences we’ve seen so far is that they are\ncategorically not mixed reality by any definition. Still, Microsoft has nicked\nthe term away from anybody else who might have wanted to use it, and it’ll be\ninteresting to see if it does anything that could be classed as ‘mixed’ in the\nnear future.\n\nMicrosoft has confirmed that mixed reality headsets will be compatible with\nany game that runs on Valve’s SteamVR platform.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nMixed reality will start to become available to consumers from 17 October,\nwhich is when the Windows 10 [Fall Creators\nUpdate](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/windows-10-fall-creators-\nupdate-2017-features-download-release-date-redstone-3-2948542) launches.\n\n## Windows Mixed Reality: The Headsets\n\nAll the headsets feature identical screen specifications, with two 1440 x\n1440-pixel LCD screens, one for each eye. Field of view is rated at 95\ndegrees, which is somewhat less than the 110 degrees offered by the [Oculus\nRift](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/oculus-touch), for comparison.\nThe screens are all capable of driving at up to 90Hz.\n\nThe headsets feature “inside-out” tracking, which means no external sensors\nare required. Instead, two cameras scan the environment around the user,\nallowing for accurate movement tracking in every direction (this is often\nknown as “six degrees of freedom”).\n\nEach one allows you to hook up to Windows PC using a single USB port and HDMI\nconnector, and mess around in virtual reality. What sort of experience you’ll\nget will depend on how powerful your computer is (see Mixed Reality vs Mixed\nReality Ultra, below).\n\n### Acer Mixed Reality Headset\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \nPrice: $299  \nAvailability: Developers Edition available now\n\n### [Lenovo Explorer](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/lenovo-explorer)\n\nPrice: $349 ($449 with controllers)  \nAvailability TBC, 17 October or afer\n\n### Dell Visor\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \nPrice: $349 ($449 with controllers)  \nAvailability TBC, 17 October or after\n\n### HP Mixed Reality Headset\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \nPrice: $329  \nAvailability: Developers Edition available now\n\n### Asus Windows Mixed Reality Headset\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \nPrice: €449 (Asus unclear on whether that’s including or excluding\ncontrollers)  \nAvailability TBC, 17 October or after  \n\n## Mixed Reality vs Mixed Reality Ultra\n\n##\n\nThere are two fundamentally different mixed reality experiences available. The\nfirst is regular mixed reality, which will run on PCs that have integrated\ngraphics (think Intel UHD graphics). These will run at a maximum of 60fps, and\nwhile Microsoft hasn’t stated whether proper SteamVR games will be supported,\nit’s very safe to assume that they won’t be. Some more basic titles will\nlikely be available, but Microsoft hasn’t clarified exactly what this means\nyet.\n\nMixed Reality Ultra is more akin to the experience you’ll get on HTC Vive and\nOculus Rift and will require a PC or [gaming\nlaptop](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-gaming-laptop) with\ndedicated [graphics card.](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-graphics-\ncard) Running at 90Hz (much smoother, better for not getting motion sick),\nyou’ll be able to play proper games at proper frame rates. This is where the\nreal fun is.\n\n**Thinking of clamping a mixed reality headset to your face? Let us know on\nTwitter @trustedreviews**\n\n"}
