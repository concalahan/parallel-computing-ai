{"result": 0, "title": "Apple Watch 4 review: Potential life-saver | Trusted Reviews", "description": "* ![Apple Watch 4]()The charger plus onto the back of the Apple Watch 4Running for an hour – with GPS, LTE and AirPods connected via Bluetooth – theApple Watch Series 4 lost between 17-23%. Disconnect the AirPods and removethe LTE functionality and you’ll save about 6-8%. Obviously these times varydepending on how often you check the watch and if you receive/take callsduring that period.LTE calling depletes the battery faster than hammering the GPS. This reaffirmsthe point that this is purely meant as an addition to your phone, rather thana futuristic wrist-based replacement for it.Charging is reasonably quick and requires about 45 minutes to reach 50% andmarginally less than two hours to get all the way to 100%, The charger itselfremains a small magnetic puck, which clips onto the bottom of the watch. Themagnets are strong and it’s not easy to accidentally knock the watch off onceit’s in place.It is quite annoying having to always the remember the proprietary Apple Watchcharger though and it feels like Apple should have, by now, come up with asimpler solution. [AirPower](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/delayed-apple-airpower-wireless-charging-pad-may-doomed-failure-3582003) – a chargingmate that’d juice up[AirPods](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/airpods), iPhones and AppleWatch simultaneously – seemed like the solution, but has yet to materialise.## **Why buy the Apple Watch 4?**Apple Watch Series 4 is not only the most impressive Apple Watch yet, but iscomfortably the most fully featured smartwatch I have ever tested. It’sApple’s best, most thought-out release in years.It’s a masterful combination of design; genuinely useful features and animpressive ecosystem. Apple’s ability to push categories like phones andlaptop forward has diminished over recent years, but this wearable is so farahead of competitors such as the [Samsung GalaxyWatch](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-watch) and WearOS releases from Fossil that it almost seems unfair.Pair the updated design featuring that gorgeous screen with the vast array of(potentially) life-saving features and you’ve _finally_ got a smartwatch thatfeels like something other than a luxury device missing a point.Nothing is perfect though, and I would still like to see an Apple Watch thattracks my sleep natively and doesn’t require plugging in at least every othernight. But they’re just minor quibbles in the grand scheme of things.## **Verdict**The Apple Watch 4 is the best smartwatch I have ever used.## Score"}
