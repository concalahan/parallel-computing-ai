Operation\nGrim Sky is the latest in a series of major content drops for the game,\nbringing with it an assortment of new operators, map redesigns and modes.\n\n_Trusted Reviews_ has compiled everything you need to know about Rainbow Six\nSiege: Grim Sky including all the latest news, release date, maps, operators\nand more.\n\n## Rainbow Six Siege: Grim Sky Release Date\n\nRainbow Six Siege: Grim Sky will go live on test servers on Monday, August\n20th with a widespread release to follow in September 2018 across PS4, Xbox\nOne and PC.\n\n## Rainbow Six Siege: Grim Sky Map Redesign – Hereford Rework\n\nGrim Sky brings the first full map rework to the game with a complete redesign\nof Hereford Base, the SAS training ground that serves as the headquarters for\nthe counter-terrorist outfit.\n\nThe map was the first one designed for Rainbow Six Siege and it shows, with\nmany of the ideas the game holds up writ small: destruction is limited, and\nthe scope of the map feels tiny, with combat focusing around one key\nstaircase, which locked off a lot of roaming potential and could often see the\nattacking team pinned down and short of options.\n\nThe rework delivers a new aesthetic which makes the building look more\natmospheric while also giving it a rustic feel. This rustic feel has the\neffect of making more external walls wooden, adding more tactical options.\nHereford Base is now bigger and broader, with more rotations, two different\nstairwells and several additional external entry-points, with add a lot more\nverticality, and hopefully create more interesting firefights.\n\n**Related:**[ **Best PS4\nGames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/ps4-games-3431751)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nEach of the building’s four floors now have bomb sites, and while Hereford\nstill has familiar elements: the garage, or the way a certain corridor curves.\nHowever, it’s a huge rework, with the highlights being a labyrinthine basement\nfilled with flanking routes and doorways, and a wide-open third floor which\nfelt unique amongst Siege’s map offerings: in the rounds we played, firefights\nhere were dynamic and unpredictable.\n\nSpeaking at the reveal, the team behind the map rework said that most of the\naction used to be located in the basement, but the four new bomb sites (one on\neach floor) should be viable for competitive play.\n\n## Rainbow Six Siege: Grim Sky Map Buff – Consulate\n\nConsulate is getting a map buff in Grim Sky, too. Consulate’s buff isn’t as\nextreme as the rework seen by Clubhouse, and instead adds an extra objective\nin the Bomb mode, an upstairs/downstairs mix of tellers and cafeteria that\nwill make holding the side entrance to consulate absolutely essential.\n\nSome external walls have been moved to make spawn peeking tougher and protect\nthe attacking team on their approach to the building, and the whole thing has\nbeen polished up a bit too. It’s a welcome shift for anyone that’s taken a\nburst of automatic gunfire to the face in the first few seconds of the round.\n\n## New Operator – Clash\n\nGrim Sky’s new defender represents the biggest paradigm shift to the defence\nin a long while. Clash, a member of London’s Metropolitan Police Service,\n\nClash’s defining ability – and primary weapon – is a giant transparent shield\nwith a taser strapped to the front, known as the Crowd Control Electro shield.\nThis shield protects Clash’s entire body, like Montagne, but also fires an\nautomatically aimed taser at anyone in sight that deals a low amount of damage\nand slows targets down substantially.\n\nAttackers don’t have the wealth of options to counter a shield operator, and\nClash can’t melee or hip fire when she’s behind it. The taser discourages\naggressive pushing, and will panic enemies who may find themselves falling\nback until they can get a more favourable fight.\n\nThis is a huge change, as Clash’s shield makes her well suited for safely\ngathering intelligence on attackers, but also gives the defenders a vanguard\nto rally behind for counterpushing enemies.\n\n**Related:**[ **Best FPS Games**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/fps-\ngames-3526310)\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThis proved massively useful during our play sessions for attacking enemies\nthat had over-extended, but Clash absolutely needs support to be effective.\nClash has access to a high-damage pistol and an accurate machine pistol and\nwhile they’re sidearms both are effective at putting an enemy down but the\nreal kicker is that to fire either of these weapons you’ll need to put the\nshield away.\n\nLink up with another defender and you can divide your enemies and let your\narmed assistant clean up for you, but Clash is defenceless against a good\nflank, meaning positioning is everything.\n\nSo much of the current meta in Siege says that when you are outnumbered, you\nshould fall back into a defensive position and wait for the attacking team to\nmake a mistake. This can be a struggle for defenders and allow attackers to\nsnowball an early kill into a win, but with Clash there’s a defender capable\nof halting the momentum of the attacking team.\n\n## New Operator – Maverick\n\nMaverick, Delta Force commando and blowtorch extraordinaire, is the game’s new\nattacker. He brings a hefty 50. Cal DMR and an M4, and while these are decent\nin a pinch, Maverick’s main strength is his ability to quietly carve holes in\nany destructible surface.\n\nMaverick’s blowtorch is his primary gadget and can be used freely to cut holes\ninto destructible surfaces, including reinforced walls, roofs, ceilings,\nCastle’s barricades and pretty much everything else.\n\nThe only thing I tried the blowtorch on that didn’t result in holes cut into\nit was Mira’s Black Mirror, but considering you can cut holes in anything it’s\neasy to circumvent these mirrors on an assault.\n\nIt could mean the end of the Bandit trick, which sees operator Bandit put down\nhis electric batteries to destroy breaching objects, as Maverick can just cut\nthrough the wall at the bottom. Sure, this might mean Thermite gets shot in\nthe feet as he plants his explosives, but you know, progress.\n\n**Related:**[ **Best Nintendo Switch\nGames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/nintendo-switch-games-3435122)\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nMaverick doesn’t bring a big change to the attacking game, but his toolkit\ndoes provide a stealthy option for attackers. Whether it’s by quietly opening\nholes for a Glaz to get eyes on the objective, or even Maverick themselves\ngoing lone wolf and taking a different approach while the rest of the team\ncause a distraction.\n\nI was a little underwhelmed with Maverick during my early playtest, but I\nsuspect Maverick is a character whose use will become more obvious after some\ntime in the wild, as the community explores the many uses for Maverick’s\nblowtorch, and cheeky spots where a small hole can provide a large advantage.\n\n## Rainbow Six Siege: Grim Sky Frost Elite Skin\n\nThe launch of Rainbow Six Siege: Grim Sky will be accompanied by a brand new\nFrost Elite Skin, something we’re certain hardcore players will be eager to\nunlock in the coming weeks.

It’s also good news for Rainbow Six Siege’s esports\necosystem to let fans support teams by buying cosmetics. It’s indicative of a\nbetter financial model for the game, and this is probably why so many big\norganisations are now buying into esports.\n\nThey’re fairly well done, too. Look at that Immortals branded Vector – it’s a\nstunner.\n\n**Related:[Best FPS Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/fps-\ngames-3526310)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Are you looking forward to Operation Grim Sky in Rainbow Six Siege?
