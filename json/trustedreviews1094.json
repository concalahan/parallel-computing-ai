Onto the challenges!\n\n## Fortnite Season 6 Week 5 Challenges – Free Battle Pass\n\n**Record a speed of 27 or more at different Radar Signs 0/5**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nGrabbing a quadcrasher is going to make this challenge a lot easier due to the\nvehicles boost ability. You can get quadcrashers from a few different places,\nbut we’d go with near the racetracks or on the lorry in Salty Springs as the\nbest places to find them. The locations of each of the traffic cams are:\n\n  * The tunnel south of Tomato Temple.\n  * Along the road near the unnamed town south of Paradise Palms\n  * Along the road leading to the race track in the desert.\n  * South-west of Lazy Links, North of Leaky Lake.\n  * The road connecting Titled Towers to Pleasant Park\n  * West of the smaller mountain south of Salty Springs.\n\n**Jump through flaming hoops with a Shopping Cart or ATK 0/5**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nGetting hold of the right vehicle for this challenge will actually be more\ndifficult than the jumping through hoops. The safest spot for an ATK is Lazy\nLinks. Just keep in mind everyone else attempting this challenge will be going\nthere, so maybe loot up before you try to grab a vehicle. You’re also going to\nneed some materials. Even though some hoops have a ramp, others don’t. So keep\nthat in mind.\n\n**Stage 1: Deal damage with a Tactical Shotgun to opponents 0/200 (HARD)**\n\nGrab a tactical shotgun and get to shooting. It may be worth heading to a\ncorrupted zone as they’re currently fairly busy due to the cube monsters. The\nfirst part of this challenge should, in theory, just be two well placed shots\nto the head to complete it.\n\n**Related:[Best Nintendo Switch\nGames](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/nintendo-switch-games-3435122)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Fortnite Season 6 Week 5 Challenges – Paid Battle Pass\n\n**Eliminate an opponent closer than 5m 0/2**\n\nYou can double this one up alongside the first stage of the tactical shotgun\nchallenge. If you’re looking for mass shotgun damage, you’re going to need to\nbe close anyway. Failing that, just sneak up behind someone and let rip.\n\n**Deal damage with SMGs to opponents 0/500**\n\nWhile you may want to grab the P90, you’d be better aiming for the blue SMG\ndue to its clip size. The P90 has great stopping potential, but if you miss\ntoo many shots, when your goal is to do damage, it’s safer to go with the blue\nSMG and spray and pray.\n\n**Eliminate opponents with a Minigun 0/2 (HARD)**\n\nYou can either play this normally, or you could just down someone then switch\nto the minigun in your hotbar to finish them off. If you’re opting to avoid\ncheap tactics (why you would we have no idea), just keep in mind the minigun\nis at its most deadly at mid to close range. Over longer distances, it’s\npretty useless. So stay close, yeah?\n\n**Deal damage with standard Pistols to Opponents**\n\nThe trick with standard pistols is to get within shotgun range, then just\nhammer the trigger and laugh as your opponent drops. The other option, just\nlike with the minigun, is to down, switch, and finish them off.\n\nNow the Season 6 Week 5 challenges have gone live, you may want to check out\nour guides for all the previous weekly challenges as well as answers to almost\nevery Fortnite question you can think of.
