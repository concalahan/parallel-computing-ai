The trend itself\nbegan after Apple’s decision to remove the long-established 3.5mm headphone\njack from the [iPhone 7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-7) and\n[7 Plus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-7-plus) back in 2016.\n\nOther manufacturers like Motorola to Huawei followed suit, but others like\nSamsung and OnePlus had shown an unwillingness to adopt the trend. However,\nthe latter’s second handset of 2018 has finally made the jump. But why now?\n\n![Pete Lau Cristiano Amon QnA OnePlus 6T\nlaunch](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nOnePlus’ Eric Gass, CEO – Pete Lau and Qualcomm’s President – Cristiano Amon\ntalking after the launch of the OnePlus 6T.\n\nIn the case of the 6T specifically, it’s all to do with one of the phone’s\nstar new features. Speaking via an interpreter, OnePlus’ CEO spoke candidly\nabout the company’s decision to omit the headphone jack from its latest\nflagship.\n\nHe said, “As a product manager, I spend a lot of time looking at hardware\ndecisions and looking at tough ‘yes’ or ‘no’ decisions… With the loss of the\nheadphone jack, we thought it was a necessary step in order to accommodate\nboth the FOD fingerprint sensor and the phone’s bigger battery.”\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nAfter he was asked how such a decision might affect OnePlus’ active fan\ncommunity, Lau continued, “To create a product that everyone likes is nearly\nimpossible, so we listened to our fans. We sent out a survey to members of our\ncommunity and found that 60% of people were already using wireless headphones.\n\n“Whether we do this now or three years in the future, there will always be\npeople who are very vocal against such change.”\n\n**Related:[Best Wireless\nHeadphones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/wireless-headphones-\nbluetooth-3450127)**\n\nReferring to the company’s own wireless Bluetooth headphones, which launched\nalongside the [OnePlus 6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/oneplus-6)\nand received a new colourway at the launch of the 6T, Lau also joked that, “If\nit [removing the headphone jack] pushes people to buy more [Bullets\nWireless](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/oneplus-bullets-wireless),\nthen great!”\n\n## OnePlus 6T: Why is there no wireless charging?\n\nAlthough the OnePlus 6 brought about a change in the company’s phones to a\nglass-backed design, neither it nor its successor, the OnePlus 6T, supports\nwireless charging. Samsung has offered the feature on every one of the Galaxy\nS and Note devices since the [Galaxy\nS6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s6) and Apple’s 2017\niPhones onwards, along with this year’s [Google Pixel\n3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-3), have all adopted\nthe feature too, so what gives?\n\nLau echoed Huawei’s stance. He said OnePlus wouldn’t implement wireless\ncharging until it thought the technology was mature enough to offer an\nexperience worthy of OnePlus users’ expectations.\n\nHe added: “The technology for wireless charging is not terribly complex – we\ncould implement it, but we haven’t wanted to. It’s too slow and we don’t think\nit drives the value that we want for our users.”\n\n**Related:[Best Wireless Chargers](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nwireless-charger-3505891)**\n\nSat beside Qualcomm’s President, Cristiano Amon, Lau also stated that:\n“Qualcomm might have a solution that works, that can deal with the heat and\nother drawbacks of current technology.”\n\nSo there you have it. While it doesn’t look like the 6T was ever destined to\noffer wireless charging, OnePlus’ CEO isn’t against the idea. However, he\nwants the technology to reach a point where OnePlus considers it a worthwhile\naddition.\n\n**What do you think?
