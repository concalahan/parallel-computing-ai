More interestingly, perhaps, the glass back paves the\nway for the pair of support Qi wireless charging, which represents a major\nstep forward for the iPhone. As you’d expect, the iPhone 8 Plus is the larger\nof the two devices, with a 4.7-inch Retina screen, while the iPhone 8 Plus\nmeasures a larger 5.5 inches.\n\nHowever, they stop short of featuring an OLED screen, as some had predicted,\nand instead retain the same IPS screen found on older iPhones. The 3.5mm\nheadphone jack is still gone, though, which may continue to irk audio buffs.\n\nUnder the hood, there’s Apple’s new [A11\nBionic](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-a11-processor-specs-\nperformance-benchmarks-3286346) processor, which the company says comes with a\nhost of performance benefits. And in terms of camera specs, the iPhone 8\nfeatures a 12-megapixel primary camera, while the iPhone 8 Plus features a\nmore impressive dual-lens setup that pairs a 12-megapixel rear ƒ/1.8 lens with\na telephoto ƒ/2.8 lens.\n\nThe table below features a full rundown of the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8 Plus’\nspecs, or hit the link below for our full comparison.\n\n**Related:[iPhone 8 vs iPhone 8\nPlus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-8-vs-iphone-8-plus-3286235)**\n\n|  iPhone 8 | iPhone 8 Plus  \n---|---|---  \n**Screen** |  4.7-inch Retina Display |  5.5-inch Retina Display  \n**Display Resolution** |  1334 x 750 |  1920 x 1080  \n**Aspect Ratio** |  16:9 |  16:9  \n**Primary Camera** |  12-megapixel rear camera, ƒ/1.8 |  Dual lens rear\ncamera: 12MP, ƒ/1.8 with telephoto, ƒ/2.8 (OIS)  \n**Secondary Camera** |  TBA |  TBA  \n**Chipset** |  A11 Bionic |  A11 Bionic  \n**RAM** |  TBA |  TBA  \n**Storage** |  64GB/256GB |  64GB/256GB  \n**Battery Capacity** |  TBA |  TBA  \n**Waterproof?** |  Yes |  Yes  \n**Fingerprint Scanner?** |  Yes |  Yes  \n**Headphone Jack?** |  No |  No  \n**Primary Port** |  Lightning | Lightning  \n**Iris Scanner?** |  No |  No  \n**Wireless Charging?** |  Yes |  Yes  \n**Micro SD Slot?** |  No |  No  \n**Dimensions** |  TBA |  TBA  \n**Weight** |  TBA |  TBA  \n**Software** |  iOS 11 |  iOS 11  \n  \n## iPhone 8 Software – Will it run on iOS 11?\n\nWay back at its annual WWDC conference in June, Apple showcased the latest\nversion of its mobile and tablet operating system: [iOS\n11](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/ios-11).\n\niOS 11 is set to launch on September 19 this year, meaning that both the\niPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus will ship with Apple’s latest software.\n\nSo what’s new? Well there are plenty of upgrades coming with iOS 11, including\nan update to Messages. In iOS 11, there will be a bigger focus on apps and\nstickers, featuring a redesigned app picker. There’s also cloud syncing so\nyour messages carry (or delete) across from an old phone to a new phone.\n\nSiri is getting a new voice that makes her much more lifelike too. It’s a\nclear bid to tackle growing competition from rivals like Amazon’s Alexa and\nthe Google Assistant. She’ll also be able to translate your voice and speak\nout the response.\n\nOther changes include updates to the the camera and photos, a redesigned\ncontrol centre, and modifications to Maps, Apple Music, and the App Store.\n\n**Related:[iPhone 8 vs Galaxy Note\n8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/galaxy-note-8-vs-iphone-8-3268870)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: Apple\n\n## iPhone 8 Summary: Should you wait for the iPhone 8?\n\nThere are plenty of reasons to wait for the iPhone 8, so here’s our advice:\n\n**If you’re using the iPhone 6S (or something older) then you’ll definitely\nwant to wait for the iPhone 8.** Apple’s next handset ushers in a significant\nredesign, and so if you’re coming to the end of a two-year contract, it’s\nabsolutely worth waiting for.\n\n**If you have the iPhone 7, you probably won’t need to upgrade.** Unless\nyou’re a die-hard Apple fan who needs to be at the bleeding edge of Cupertino\ntech, it probably isn’t going to be worth the leap. Even considering the fact\nthat the iPhone 8 offers a handful of major changes, the iPhone 7 is still a\ncapable handset by modern standards.
