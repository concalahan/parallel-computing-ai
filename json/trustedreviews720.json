It’s also said to be smaller – in height,\nthickness and width – than its predecessor, the Xperia XZ Premium.\n\nThe Xperia XZ Pro will come with Qualcomm’s [Snapdragon\n835](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/bitflyer-worlds-largest-bitcoin-\nethereum-exchange-uk-european-launch-3381257) or all-new [Snapdragon\n845](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/snapdragon-845-phones-benchmark-\nspeeds-release-date-camera-quick-charge-4-3350708) processor, at least 6GB of\nRAM, 64GB of expandable internal storage, a dual rear camera setup\n(18-megapixel + 12-megapixel), a 13-megapixel front-facing selfie shooter and\na 3420mAh non-removable battery, according to a recent leak from Chinese\noutlet _MyDrivers_.\n\nBut we’d suggest those internals with a considerable pinch of salt, because a)\nwe were unable to verify the information with our trusted sources; b) the\nsupposed leaked images _MyDrivers_ supplied are extremely hazy, so much so\nthey could be mistaken for home-brewed renders at first glance; and c) the\nspec sheet is even hazier than the aforementioned renders.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Image: MyDrivers**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n###  Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nOne thing we aren’t sold on is _MyDriver’_ s tip that the Xperia XZ Pro will\nbe armed with the next-generation Snapdragon 845 processor, as that would fly\nin the face of numerous (more credible) reports which suggest that Samsung’s\nmuch-anticipated [Galaxy S9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-\ngalaxy-s9-release-date-specs-features-price-uk-3266552) and Galaxy S9 Plus\nwill be getting first dibs on Qualcomm’s brand new SoC – as it did last year\nwith the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Image: MyDrivers**\n\nOn a more official note, Sony has filed the\n[documentation](https://fccid.io/PY7-21831A) required to bundle an audio\ntransfer adapter in the box of its next flagship smartphone with the Federal\nCommunications Commission (FCC), leading many to believe that the upcoming\nXperia XZ Pro will do away with the beloved 3.5mm headphone jack – though\nthat’s far from confirmed.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Sony Xperia XZ Pro: Release date and price\n\n_MyDrivers_ expects the Xperia XZ Pro to fetch at least £675 ($930) when it\nhits the shelves. If that turns out to be the case, it will be in prime\nposition to win over customers in the market for a brand new high-end\nsmartphone, who aren’t willing to shell out £999 ($999) for Apple’s flagship\n[iPhone X](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-x).\n\nThe next Sony flagship phone is expected to be revealed at Mobile World\nCongress (MWC 2018) in February. We’ll be on the ground in Barcelona in full\nforce reporting live from Sony’s February 26 press event, where the device\nshould be unveiled, so be sure to check back on the big day.\n\nIn the meantime, stay tuned as we’ll be updating this page with all the latest\nSony Xperia XZ Pro news and rumours.\n\n**What would you like to see the next Sony phone feature?
