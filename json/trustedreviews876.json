Here’s what\nwe know so far, including the expected Huawei Nexus 6P’s release date, new\nfeatures and the latest info on specs.**\n\nMany smartphone giants have worked with Google on the Nexus program, but\nHuawei is a big name that’s always been missing from the list.\n\nThat looks set to change, since Google is widely rumoured to have tapped\nHuawei for the next Nexus smartphone.\n\nSpecifically, Huawei is expected to be the name behind the new Nexus 6.\nCodenamed Angler, and [tipped for launch as Nexus\n6P](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/report-google-s-new-smartphones-\ncalled-nexus-5x-and-nexus-6p), it’s a phablet-sized successor to last year’s\neponymous handset.\n\nThe Nexus 6P (2014) received a lukewarm reception, largely thanks to its hefty\nprice tag and distinct lack of wow factor.\n\nGoogle hopes to reverse its fortunes this time around, so it really needs the\nNexus 6P (2015) to impress.\n\n_**Update: Hours ahead of launch, we’ve hit upon the motherlode of leaks,\nrevealing what looks very likely to be the entire spec sheet for the Nexus\n6P.**_\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [

\n **What’s new about the Huawei Nexus 6P?** _Marshmallow, USB-C, fingerprint\nscanner_  \n **How much will the Huawei Nexus 6P cost?** _£499+_\n\n**Related:[LG Nexus

– Everything you need to know**\n\n**Check out our Motorola Nexus 6 (2014) video review below:**\n\n## When will the Huawei Nexus 6P come out?\n\nWe already pretty much know when Google will _unveil_ the Nexus 6P, even if\nthe exact release date evades us.\n\nThat’s because Google has invited _TrustedReviews_ , and a number of other\npress organisations, to a dedicated product launch event on September 29. Stay\ntuned.\n\nThe best way for us to work out when the Nexus 6P release date will fall is by\nlooking at previous Nexus launches.\n\nFortunately for us all, Google is a creature of habit when it comes to its\nsmartphone line-up.\n\nSince 2011, every Nexus smartphone has held an October release date. That\nincludes the Galaxy Nexus, the Nexus 4, the Nexus 5, and last year’s Nexus 6.\n\nLogic dictates that we’ll see a similar launch window from the next-gen Huawei\nNexus 6P.\n\nIt’s worth noting that the new Nexus 6P is expected to be a launch vehicle for\nGoogle’s upcoming [Android 6.0\nMarshmallow](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/android-m-features)\nsoftware update.\n\nThe revamp to the mobile OS is expected to move out of beta-testing this\nautumn, which gels with the October Nexus launch.\n\nDon’t forget that Google is also rumoured to be developing a second Nexus\nsmartphone for 2015, namely the [LG Nexus\n5X](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-nexus-5-2015-release-date-rumours-\nnews-specs-and-price).\n\nThat’s expected to launch alongside the Huawei Nexus 6P, so the choice is\nyours.\n\n**Related:[Android 6.0 Marshmallow\nfeatures](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/android-m-features)**\n\n## What’s new about the Huawei Nexus 6P?\n\nWe’re expecting a number of major improvements over last year’s tepidly\nreceived [Motorola Nexus 6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/nexus-6-review).\n\nThe shiny new feature we’re most sure about is Google’s [Android 6.0\nMarshmallow](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/android-m-features)\nupdate.\n\nNew versions of Google’s mobile operating system always debut on Nexus\ndevices, so the Nexus 6P is assured to arrive toting the chewy goodness of\nMarshmallow.\n\n![Nexus 6\n17](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nWe’re also expecting Google to include a fingerprint scanner on the new Huawei\nNexus 6P. The sensor was sorely missed on last year’s model.\n\nIt’s also widely rumoured that a [USB-C\nport](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/usb-type-c-everything-you-need-\nto-know) will also make it onto the final version of the Nexus 6 (2015). The\nnew USB standard is set to be an increasingly common feature of smartphones\nover the next year.\n\nAnd, naturally, there’ll be a number of spec improvements in store for the new\nNexus 6P, including boosts to the processor, RAM, and camera.\n\n## Should I wait for the Huawei Nexus 6P?\n\nGoogle is expected to launch two Nexus phones this year, which is tacit\nconfirmation that a single Nexus handset can’t be all things to all people.\n\nWhether you should wait for the Huawei Nexus 6P depends on what you want from\na smartphone.\n\nFor instance, the new Nexus 6P is expected to land as a phablet, which means\nit will use a screen size of at least 5.76-inches – so the rumours say. The\nnumber at the end of the name tends to signify screen size on all past Nexus\nproducts, whether tablet or phone.\n\nFans of smaller phones might not be able to get to grips with the Nexus 6P,\nwhile those with pan-hands will get along just find with Google’s new phone.\n\nFor those for whom 6-inches is simply too big, the also-rumoured [LG Nexus\n5X](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-nexus-5-2015-release-date-rumours-\nnews-specs-and-price) is expected to launch this October too. That might serve\ndainty palms better.\n\nIt’s also worth mentioning that [Android 6.0\nMarshmallow](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/android-m-features) will\ndebut on the Nexus 6P, so you’ll have Google’s latest software before everyone\nusing third-party handsets.\n\nWhat’s more, Nexus devices use unadulterated versions of Android software, so\nyou’ll be getting raw, gooey Marshmallow. Mmm, tasty.\n\nHowever, the Nexus 6P will be going up against serious opposition from 2015’s\njam-packed smartphone market.\n\nAs such, it’s worth considering larger flagship rivals like the [Galaxy S6\nEdge+](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-s6-edge-plus-review), the\n[LG G4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/lg-g4-review), and the [OnePlus\n2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/oneplus-2-review) as alternatives.\n\nYou might also want to try the [iPhone 6S\nPlus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-6s-release-date-rumours-news-\nspecs-and-price) on for size, which is expected to land on September 18,\nlaunching with [iOS 9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/ios-9-review) in tow.\n[Check out our Marshmallow vs iOS 9 feature\nhere.](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/android-m-vs-ios-9)\n\n**Check out our smartphone group test video below:**\n\n**Related:[Best Android Smartphones 2015](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-\nandroid-phones-1_round-up)**\n\n## In-Depth: Nexus 6P Specs & Features Explained\n\nThe expected launch of the new Huawei Nexus 6P is nearly upon us, so all eyes\nare on Google ahead of time.\n\nHere’s our round-up of what we expect the next-gen Nexus 6P to look like when\nthe rumoured October launch window finally arrives.\n\n**Nexus 6P (2015) display:**\n\nWhen it comes to the Nexus 6P (2015) display, the leaks have reached a general\nconsensus that a 5.76-inch panel is set to be used.\n\nThat’s actually smaller than last year’s model. The [2014 Nexus\n6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/nexus-6-review) used a gigantic 5.96-inch\nscreen, which was a first for Google’s smartphone series. It also meant it was\nunwieldy – just a little to big to be used with one hand by most people.\n\n![Nexus 6\n5](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nGoogle probably wants to bring the Nexus 6 more in line with competitors like\nthe Samsung [Galaxy Note 5](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-\nnote-5-review) and [iPhone 6\nPlus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/iphone-6-plus-review), and a slightly\nsmaller screen is an easy way of doing that.\n\nIt’s also incredibly likely that we’ll see the display featuring a 1,440 x\n2,560 pixel QHD resolution.\n\nAside from the leaks that say as much, last year’s Nexus 6 used that\nresolution, so it’s improbable Google would step down for this year’s model.\n\n**Related:[Android Marshmallow vs iOS\n9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/android-m-vs-ios-9)**\n\n**Nexus 6P (2015) design:**\n\nNexus smartphones have typically adopted a very generic design, and that’s\nalways helped keep costs down.\n\nThe Nexus 6P, while tipped to be built from premium metal materials, will\nadopt a fairly standard shape, at least according to leaks.\n\nOur best look yet at the rumoured handset comes courtesy of a video leak of a\nrender purportedly based on factory schematics.\n\nCheck it out:\n\n(YouTube)pBZgsRpFfP4(/YouTube)\n\nThickness is a bit of a tricky one, because the new Nexus 6P looks likely to\nhave a curvacious rear.\n\nAccording to leaked specifications, the phone’s profile will be 6.6mm at the\nedges, but will measure 8.5mm at the thickest middle section.\n\nNeither measurement is huge, although 8.5mm is far less trim than svelte\nflagships like Apple’s [iPhone\n6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/iphone-6-review) and the [Samsung Galaxy\nS6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-s6-review).\n\nWe’ve also had a second [Nexus 6P\nleak](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/huawei-nexus-6-leak-could-be-our-\nbest-look-yet-at-google-s-next-smartphone), this time courtesy of OnLeaks,\nwhich reveals the claimed device from a number of angles.\n\nThe handset looks largely similar to the one depicted in the video leak, which\nis encouraging.\n\nWe’ve also seen leaked shots of [claimed Nexus 6P\npackaging](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/nexus-5x-and-\nnexus-6p-packaging-leaks), which corrborates the rumoured ‘-P’ suffix.\n\n![huawei nexus 6\nleak](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Nexus 6P (2015) camera:**\n\nCameras are undoubtedly one of the most important features of any 2015\nsmartphone.\n\nAs such, there’s plenty of pressure on Google et al. to get the Nexus 6P’s\nphotography credentials right.\n\nFortunately, the Huawei Nexus 6P has been tipped to use either a 13-megapixel\nor 21-megapixel camera.\n\nThe latter would be an upgrade on last year’s (in megapixel size at least),\nwhile the former is the same sensor rumoured to appear on this year’s [LG\nNexus 5](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-nexus-5-2015-release-date-\nrumours-news-specs-and-price).![Nexus 6\n13](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)When it comes to selfies, both a 4-megapixel and\n5-megapixel image sensor have been leaked – there’s not a huge difference\neither way, honestly.\n\nLet’s not forget that megapixel count isn’t everything however, so we’ll have\nto see what sort of sensor Huawei springs for.\n\nThere’s a good chance Huawei will use the same Sony-developed 13-megapixel\nRGBW sensor that we saw featured on this year’s [Huawei\nP8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/huawei-p8-review).\n\nThat particular camera came paired with optical image stabilisation, and met\n[positive coverage for its snapping\ncapability](https://www.trustedreviews.com/huawei-p8-review-camera-page-2).\n\nWe’d also expect to see LED flash and laser autofocus making an appearance\ntoo.\n\n**Related:[Best Smartphone 2015](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-\nsmartphone_round-up)**\n\n**Nexus 6P (2015) specs:**\n\nThe Nexus 6P is going to be Google’s top-end device for 2015, so it’s expected\nto ship with powerful components at its core.\n\nUnfortunately, we still don’t have a definitive answer as to what chip Google\nand Huawei have sprung for with the new Nexus P6.\n\nThere are two main contenders for the Nexus 6P (2015), namely the Snapdragon\n810 and Snapdragon 820, both built by US semiconductor firm Qualcomm.\n\nQualcomm chips are incredibly popular with smartphone and tablet\nmanufacturers, and appear in countless devices across all price spectrums.\n\nThe Snapdragon 810 has been out for a little while already, first debuting on\nthe [LG G Flex 2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/lg-g-flex-2-review) way back\nin January.\n\nHowever, the 810’s reputation precedes it, specifically its alleged propensity\nto overheat when pushed to its limits.  \n![Nexus 6\n11](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)Since its launch, the Snapdragon 810 has received\nendless criticism for its lofty temperatures, and that could ward off Google\nand Huawei.\n\nIn fact, many major manufacturers avoided using the 810 in 2015, instead\nopting for other chipsets ([Galaxy S6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-\ngalaxy-s6-review) w/ Exynos) or less powerful Snapdragons ([LG\nG4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/lg-g4-review) w/ SD808).\n\nCouple the overheating issues with the fact that the 810 is now getting on a\nbit and it’s easy to see that Google might not be so keen to adopt the 810.\n\nAs such, that puts the Snapdragon 820 firmly in the running. Qualcomm only\njust outed the chip, but it’s expected to land on smartphones in late\n2015/early 2016.\n\nThe problem is that we’re not sure whether late 2015 is ‘early’ enough for an\nOctober-launching smartphone.\n\nQualcomm was rumoured to be giving manufacturers access to Snapdragon 820\nsamples in the second half of 2015, so Huawei may already have had its hands\non the chip.\n\nIf Huawei does end up using the 820 though, we can expect it to be seriously\npowerful, as clued by [a claimed AnTuTu\nbenchmark](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/huawei-new-\nnexus-6-2015-snapdragon-820-samsung-galaxy-s6) for the Nexus 6P.\n\nHowever, we should note that Huawei already has its own chip-making spin-off\ndivision called HiSilicon.  \n![Nexus 6\n19](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \nIts Kirin-series chips have featured in a number of smartphones, and the top-\nend Kirin 930 offers formidable processing capability.\n\nWhat’s more, there are two more chips – the Kirin 940 and 950 – purported to\nbe in HiSilicon’s pipeline, so either of these could appear.\n\nInterestingly, a recent report also suggested we’ll see three [storage options\nwith the Nexus 6P](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/huawei-nexus-6-could-\noffer-128gb-storage) – 32GB, 64GB, and 128GB.\n\nThe latter storage option is a first for Nexus-series smartphones, and brings\nthe handset in line with some of its top-end rivals.\n\n**Related:[Best Android Apps 2015](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-\nandroid-apps_round-up)**\n\n**Nexus 6P (2015) software:**\n\nWhile most of this round-up is based on rumours, leaks, and speculation,\nthere’s one thing we can be sure of – [Android 6.0\nMarshmallow](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/android-m-features).\n\nThat’s Google’s upcoming software update for its mobile operating system, and\na dead cert to appear on 2015’s two new Nexus handsets.\n\nIn fact, as is typical with Nexus devices, both the [LG Nexus\n5](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-nexus-5-2015-release-date-rumours-\nnews-specs-and-price) and the Huawei Nexus 6 will be the very first handsets\nto receive the update, well ahead of third-party offerings.\n\nAnd thanks to Google’s I/O developer conference, we already know plenty about\nwhat the software side of the next-gen Nexus 6P will look like.\n\nOne of the biggest features landing with Marshmallow is Android Pay, Google’s\nlong-awaited answer to [Apple\nPay](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/what-is-apple-pay) and Samsung\nPay.  \n![Nexus 6\n3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)  \nIn fairness, Android Pay is actually a revamp of Google’s existing mobile\npayments service that’s already been kicking around in the US since 2010 –\nwith limited success, we should add.\n\nIt works just like Apple Pay, insofar as users can walk into stores, place\ntheir smartphones on payment terminals, and leave laden with purchased\ngoodies.\n\nThe Android 6.0 update will also bring Google Now on Tap, with is a context-\ndriven upgrade for Google’s mobile digital assistant.\n\nLet’s say you’re watching a video, for instance. You can hold the home button\ndown and get information about the person on-screen directly through Google\nNow.\n\nIn the same vein, if someone is texting you and they mention a restaurant,\nGoogle Now on Tap can get you immediate information about the food spot\nreferenced.\n\nDon’t forget that Marshmallow also finally brings the ability to say “OK\nGoogle” to access Google Now from anywhere in the Android OS. Wahey!\n\nApp permissions will be getting a little smarter with Marshmallow too. Now\nwhen you download an app, you won’t be met with an impenetrable list of app\npermission requests.  \n![Nexus 6](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \nInstead, Google will mimic iOS and request permission for certain functions\nonly when a relevant feature is used.\n\nOther Marshmallow features include standardised support for fingerprint\nscanners, improvements to battery life a la ‘Doze’, and volume control\nsimplifications.\n\nThere’s one big feature of Android that won’t be changing with Marshmallow\nhowever, and that’s the ‘material design’ aesthetic first introduced in\n[Android 5.0 Lollipop](https://www.trustedreviews.com/android-5-0-lollipop-\nreview).\n\nGoogle has gone to great lengths to get in-house and third-party developers\nalike to adopt the new, flat design, so it’s way too soon to ditch the style\nnow.\n\n**Related:[Google I/O 2015: Everything that\nhappened](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/google-i-o-what-to-expect)**\n\n**Nexus 6P (2015) features:**\n\nLast year’s Nexus 6 was, above all else, uninspiring. That’s mostly because\nthere was very little that was special about Google’s fresh-faced phablet.\n\nThis time around, it appears as though Google is pulling out all the stops,\nand bundling on bleeding edge features in an effort to restore the Nexus line\nto its former glory.\n\nPerhaps the biggest disappointment with the [original Nexus\n6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/nexus-6-review) (aside from a lower-priced\nNexus 5 launched next to it) was the absence of a fingerprint scanner, putting\nthe handset at a serious disadvantage to many of its competitors.\n\nWhat irked fans even more was the fact that rumours suggested Google had\nintended to feature a scanner, but scrapped it at the last minute.\n\nFortunately, Google is widely tipped to be plotting a fingerprint scanner for\nthe Huawei Nexus 6P.\n\nSeveral leaks have suggested this to be the case, including the leaked render\nvideo we posted earlier on in this round-up.\n\nHowever, the biggest clue is that [Android 6.0\nMarshmallow](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/android-m-features) is\ngoing to standardise fingerprint support across the mobile OS.\n\nGoogle made a huge deal about fingerprint scanners at its annual I/O developer\nconference this year, so we’d be very surprised if the Marshmallow launch\nvehicles didn’t feature the tech.\n\nIt’s also probable that Google will want to use the fingerprint scanner to\nimprove Android Pay security.\n\nWe’re also expecting Google to finally jump on the\n[USB-C](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/usb-type-c-everything-you-\nneed-to-know) bandwagon.  \n![Nexus 6\n21](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg) _The USB-C on the OnePlus 2_\n\nThat’s the burgeoning USB standard that’s set to take the mobile devices world\nby storm over the next year.\n\nBack at I/O, Google lauded the benefits of USB-C, and said it would work to\nroll out the technology. What more confirmation do we need?\n\nIf that’s not enough for you, the leaked renders we’ve seen so far all seem to\ninclude USB-C ports, which lends further credence to the theory.\n\nOther features likely to appear on the next-gen Nexus 6P include Wi-Fi\nsupport, an NFC chip, and Bluetooth 4.2 connectivity.  \n![Nexus 6\n9](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\n**Related:[Android Pay vs Apple\nPay](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/android-pay-vs-apple-pay)**\n\n**Nexus 6P (2015) price:**\n\nThe Nexus 6P pricing is likely to be a serious issue of contention, mainly\nbecause it caused plenty of controversy last time around.\n\nBefore 2014, the Nexus line-up was seen as a way to get pure Android on a\ndecent smartphone without forking out half of your pay-cheque.\n\nHowever, last year’s [Nexus 6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/nexus-6-review)\nchanged all that, and saw Google adopt a new modus operandi of ravaging your\nwallet.\n\nAt £499, the Nexus 6 was the most expensive smartphone ever produced by\nGoogle, and ranked alongside pricey flagships like the iPhone 6 and Galaxy S5.\n\nThe Huawei Nexus 6P (2015) is expected to be similarly high-end, and with top\nbill components comes a hefty R.R.P.\n\nIt’s tough to pin down an exact price, but we’d be very surprised if Google\npeddled the Nexus 6 for anything less than £499.\n\nAnd if the handset ships with all the bells and whistles –\n[USB-C](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/usb-type-c-everything-you-\nneed-to-know), fingerprint sensor, QHD screen – we could see that price rise\nnorth of £599 too.\n\n**Share your thoughts on what you’d like to see from the Huawei Nexus 6P\n(2015) in the comments below.**\n\n"}
