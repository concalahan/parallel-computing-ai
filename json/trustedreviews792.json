So that you don’t have to call\nup the business yourself, Google has trained Assistant to be able to make the\ncall for you.\n\nGoogle’s first example was using the voice assistant to book a haircut. The\nuser typed in what kind of haircut they’d like between what times and the\nassistant was able to call up and have a convincing conversation with the\nsalon’s secretary. And by convincing we really do mean convincing.\n\n“Powered by a new technology we call Google Duplex, the Assistant can\nunderstand complex sentences, fast speech, and long remarks, so it can respond\nnaturally in a phone conversation,” says Google.\n\n“Even though the calls will sound very natural, the Assistant will be clear\nabout the intent of the call so businesses understand the context.”\n\nOnce the appointment was booked, Assistant knew to place a calendar event in\nthe user’s Google Calendar.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n## A true digital assistant\n\nThe second interaction was even more impressive. Despite the fact that the\nrestaurant didn’t accept reservations for the amount of people Google\nAssistant was trying to book for, the voice assistant was still able to\nnavigate the conversation to establish that waiting times wouldn’t be too long\nif the party turned up that evening.\n\nFor its final trick, Pichai detailed how the Assistant could make a phone call\nto establish a business’s opening times, before automatically updating its\nlisting on the search engine.\n\nIt was a pretty stunning moment from I/O, but we couldn’t help but be a little\ntaken aback at how effective it was. The new functionality is going to be\ntested over the coming weeks and months, but no full release has yet been\nannounced.\n\n**Would you trust Google Assistant to book a haircut on your behalf?
