It is held in\nplace by the magnets surrounding the edge of the new iPad Pro, which are also\ncapable of wirelessly charging the Apple Pencil 2.\n\n**Related:[Apple October event round-\nup](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-october-event-2018-3612624)**\n\nThe previous model, which was launched three years ago connected the iPad Pro\nvia a new physical Smart Connector that did not require Bluetooth. That\nmagnetic connection for pairing will replace the need for the Smart Connector,\nwhich is absent from the brand new iPad Pro. The keyboard also never needs to\nbe charged, Apple says.\n\nAs it did with the new Apple Pencil 2, the company is also charging more money\nfor the new keyboard solution. It will be $179.99 for the 11-inch Smart\nKeyboard Folio and $199.99 for the 12.9-inch model. That’s up from the $169.99\nApple charged for the original Smart Keyboard.\n\n**Related:[iPad Pro 2018 vs iPad Pro\n2017](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ipad-pro-2018-vs-ipad-\npro-2017-3612809)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Lenovo Smart Display 10](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n###  Lenovo Smart Display 10″\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/lenovo-smart-display-10 \"Lenovo Smart\nDisplay 10″\")\n\n  * [ ![Google Home Hub volume controls](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### How to set up Google Duo on smart displays for video and audio calls\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/how-to/how-to-set-up-google-duo-on-smart-\ndisplays-for-video-and-audio-calls-3613068 \"How to set up Google Duo on smart\ndisplays for video and audio calls\")\n\n  *   * [ ![iPad Pro 2018 Smart Keyboard](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Apple adds new magnetic Smart Keyboard folio for iPad Pro 2018\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-smart-keyboard-\nfolio-2018-features-3613051 \"Apple adds new magnetic Smart Keyboard folio for\niPad Pro 2018\")\n\n  * \n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nHere’s what Apple has to say: “The new Smart Keyboard Folio protects both the\nfront and back of iPad Pro in a simple, thin and light design encompassing a\nfull-size keyboard that never needs to be charged or paired.
