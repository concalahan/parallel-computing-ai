Available for $9.99 (UK pricing TBC), players can gain an\nassortment of new items and cosmetics by progressing through the passes’\nmultiple tiers.\n\nIt’s increasingly clear that PUBG is hoping to iterate upon the battle royale\nformula, and this progression system, despite its similarities to Fortnite, is\na big step forward in making sure PUBG remains fun and engaging to play.\n\n## PUBG Maps – What are the latest developments?\n\nPUBG’s latest achievement of 50 million players was announced alongside a\nsmaller, more strategic map known as Sanhok. After three rounds of testing, it\nwill be available on public servers starting Friday, June 22.\n\nAvailable as part of the latest\n[update](https://playbattlegrounds.com/news/186.pu) coming this Friday, Sanhok\nis considerably smaller than the likes of Miramar and Erangel. As a result,\nmatches will be shorter and more frantic, too.\n\n**Related:[Call of Duty Black Ops 4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/call-\nof-duty-black-ops-4-3373836) **\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nEvery game will still feature 100 players, but major changes have been made to\ncertain elements so things will start fast and end even faster. No more hiding\nin a building for 20 minutes before getting sniped across the map.\n\nThe Blue and Red Zones will now react to players accordingly, dynamically\nshifting in a way that will force you to prioritize movement and engage with\nenemies to survive.\n\nItem and spawn balance have also been retooled so you can prepare for battle\nfaster, and that all players stand an equal chance of kitting themselves up\nbefore things kick off.\n\n## PUBG Platforms – What can I play it on?\n\nPlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds is currently available to purchase on PC and\nXbox One. The latter is available through the console’s preview programme so\nbe mindful that the game is will continue to undergo patches and improvements\nand is not a final build.\n\nBluehole has said in the past that PUBG will eventually come to[\nPS4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/ps4-pro), although has no concrete\nplans in motion at the moment. Speaking to[\nInvenGlobal](https://www.invenglobal.com/articles/3881/id-like-pubg-to-become-\na-universal-media-franchise-ch-kim-the-ceo-of-pubg-corp), PUBG Corp CEO Chang\nHan Kim said, “if we have the opportunity, the final goal would be to launch\nthe title on every platform.”\n\n“I’d like PUBG to become a universal media franchise based on the game. We\nwant to take part in diverse industries including eSports, movies, drama,\ncartoons, animation, and more. In fact, we received a couple of lovely calls\nfrom a number of developers in Hollywood and Netflix. Our dream is to build a\nnew game-based culture through various ways like this, and have the lead of\nthat culture.”\n\n## **PUBG Mobile – What is it?**\n\nPUBG: Exhilarating Battlefield is an official adaptation of Bluehole’s Battle\nRoyale blockbuster that’s only available to download in China right now. It’s\nsurprisingly faithful to the PC version, complete with similar UI, mechanics\nand you’re still chasing that chicken dinner at every turn.\n\nOf course, some visual compromises have been made and the upgrade path for\nyour in-game avatar has been altered slightly and now comes with far more\ncustomization options. PUBG Corp is yet to announce whether it will see an\ninternational release, although you can play it right now by following an\nonline tutorial.\n\n**Order PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds from**[ **Amazon\nUK**](http://amzn.to/2Fm5OOM)\n\n## PUBG Player Count – How many people are playing?\n\nAccording to [SteamSpy](https://steamspy.com/app/578080), Over **30 million\nplayers** have purchased PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds on PC and it continues\nto hold the record for most concurrent players at any given time. Last month\nmarked the first monthly period where the overall install base didn’t\nincrease, although this sort of plateau was to be expected.\n\nBluehole recently announced that PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds has surpassed\n50 million players across all platforms, a pretty impressive feat. However,\nit’s still no way near the 125 million Fortnite boasts.\n\n_**Are you a big PUBG player? Let us know on Facebook and Twitter\n@trustedreviews.**_\n\n"}
