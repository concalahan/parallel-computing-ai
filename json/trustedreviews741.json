If you’ve used an iPhone 6 or 6S you’ll feel like you’ve returned home\nafter a long holiday and the window curtains have been changed.\n\nFor standing out from the iPhone crowd, the new Jet Black finish is really\nyour only option. A Jet Black iPhone 7 looks like no other handset. It’s not\nlike the plastic iPhone 5C – this is a phone made out of metal, but which is\nsmooth to touch without being slippery. Yes, it attracts fingerprints, but who\ncares when it looks this good? One not of caution, though. It does mark up a\nlittle easily so you’ll need to treat it with care if you want it to keep\nlooking good.\n\n**Related:[Galaxy S8+ hands-on](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-\ngalaxy-s8-plus-review \"Galaxy S8 Plus hands-on\")**\n\n![iphone\n7](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nThe second new colour on offer is simply called Black. This replaces the Space\nGrey of previous models and makes the iPhone 7 looks like a mean machine. The\nother versions available are Silver, Gold and Rose Gold.\n\nThe iPhone 7’s size and shape is almost identical to the previous models,\nhowever the antenna bands that formerly ran across the back now tastefully\ncurve around the ends, and the camera nub is more rounded. These changes are\nsmall, but welcome, although it does mean you won’t be able to use an old 6 or\n6S case.\n\n**WATCH: iPhone 7 video review**\n\nThe iPhone 7 retains those chunky top and bottom areas of its bezel and this\nmeans it offers less screen space for its size than the [HTC\n10](https://www.trustedreviews.com/htc-10-review), [LG\nG5](https://www.trustedreviews.com/lg-g5-review) or [Samsung Galaxy\nS7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-s7-review). The latter has\nvery similar dimensions but comes with a 5.1-inch screen, compared to the\n4.7-incher on the iPhone 7. It feels like some other brands have overtaken\nApple when it comes to phone design.\n\nThat’s all there is to discuss about the aesthetics. However, there’s plenty\nto talk about when it comes to design. Apple’s made some fundamental changes\nto the iPhone 7 that will affect the way you use your phone for better and\nworse.\n\nLet’s start with the missing headphone socket. For some people this is going\nto be a big issue, but it hasn’t been a problem for me.\n\nThere are a number of potential reasons why Apple’s decided to remove the\n3.5mm socket from the iPhone 7, but the company won’t outright tell us why.\n\n**Related:[iOS 11 review: Apple’s best update in\nyears?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/ios-11)**\n\nSpace seems to be the primary factor when you look at the internal design. The\nnew Haptic engine is a lot chunkier and takes up some of the space, as does\nthe louder speaker that’s been crammed into the bottom. Apple has clearly\ndecided improved features on the iPhone 7 are better than keeping a 50-year-\nold connection, particularly since wireless headphones have become\nincreasingly popular over the past few years. In fact, Apple has launched its\nown wireless headphones, called AirPods. Shame [you’re going to need ‘courage’\nto wear AirPods](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/apple-airpods-\ntoothbrush) outside…\n\n**Related:[Galaxy S8 review](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-\ngalaxy-s8-review \"Galaxy S8 hands-on\")**  \n![iphone 7\n31](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThat’s all well and good, but for many who own a great pair of wired\nheadphones this will prove a problem. Apple has resolved it to a great extent\nby providing a pair of Lightning Earpods and a small adapter in the box with\nthe iPhone 7. The adapter lets you plug wired headphones into the charging\nport. It works well, but you won’t be able to charge your phone and listen at\nthe same time, plus it’s small and easy to misplace.\n\n**Related:[iOS 12\nfeatures](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ios-12-release-date-\nfeatures-3385158)**\n\nThere are some neat third-party Bluetooth aptX headphone adapters available,\nsuch as the £69 Noble Audio BTS, but be prepared for an inevitable drop in\naudio quality when used with high-end headphones.\n\nI haven’t been too affected by the lack of jack. Having bought into the\nconvenience of wireless headphones a few years ago, I now favour them over my\nbetter-sounding wired pairs. It’s a transition I expect many of us will make\nover the coming years.\n\nThe other design change I got to grips with quickly is the new Home button –\nif you can still call it that.\n\nGone is the iconic click; it now has capacitive touch sensitivity. That means\nit works using the tiny bits of electricity in your fingers, just like the\nscreen does, so if you’re wearing normal gloves it won’t function.\n\n**Related:[iPhone 9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-9-release-\ndate-specs-features-price-rumours-uk-3297160)**\n\nIncredibly, I could’ve sworn that the button had some give to it until I\nturned the phone off and realised that I’d been duped. That’s how good the new\nHaptic engine is. The feedback it offers tricks your brain into thinking the\nbutton can actually be pressed. This isn’t just smoke and mirrors; it feels\nreal. I thought I’d miss the old iconic iPhone Home button, but I don’t.\n\nThat Haptic engine is used for more than just the Home button, though – the\niPhone 7 now feels like it talks to you by vibrating at key moments. Whether\nyou’re scrolling through the timer or getting a call, the refined buzzes tell\nyou a lot more than the [iPhone\n6S](https://www.trustedreviews.com/iphone-6s-review) ever did.\n\n## iPhone 7 – Water resistant\n\nOne of the reasons the Home button has been changed is because of the iPhone\n7’s headline feature: water resistance.\n\nApple may not be the first to create a water-resistant phone, but it’s a\nbrilliant feature to have nonetheless. That’s because one of the main reasons\npeople ruin their phone is through water damage. I’ve broken a phone or two by\ndropping it in the wet stuff in the past.\n\n![iPhone 7 pictures\n10](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe iPhone 7 is hardy enough now to withstand a moderate dunk in up to 1m of\nwater for up to 30 minutes. The iPhone 7 manages an IP67 rating for water and\ndust resistance, which is a little less than the certification achieved by the\nGalaxy S7 and [Sony Xperia Z5](https://www.trustedreviews.com/sony-\nxperia-z5-review). Don’t let that bother you, though. The difference is small\nand I’ve used the iPhone 7 in the shower and left it in water for 30 minutes\nand it still works just fine.\n\n**Related:[Best Phone to Buy](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-\nsmartphone_round-up)**\n\nWater resistance is an added level of insurance for flagships that cost a lot\nto replace. It certainly came to my rescue when I dropped the iPhone 7 in a\npuddle while camping on a wet weekend.\n\n[ Next  \nScreen and Speakers ](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-7-screen-\nand-speakers-page-2)\n\n"}
