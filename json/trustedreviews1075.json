We take an in-depth look at Amazon’s membership\nprogramme to see whether signing up to Prime is really worth the fee ahead\nof[Amazon Prime Day UK](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-amazon-\nprime-day-2018-deals-3482743).**\n\nAmazon Prime is the company’s paid membership programme. Customers who sign up\nget access to numerous benefits including speedy delivery and use of Amazon’s\nstreaming video and music library.\n\nIn fact the list of bonus services is pretty generous, but is it really worth\nthe monthly, or yearly subscription cost? Read on to find out.\n\n## What is Amazon Prime?\n\nAs mentioned, Amazon Prime is a membership programme which gives Amazon\ncustomers a range of extra features and benefits. Subscribers can choose to\neither pay monthly or yearly, and will gain access to free one-day delivery on\nthousands of items in the Amazon Store.\n\nAnd while the service was initially just aimed at providing speedy delivery,\nAmazon has since expanded it significantly to include the following extra\nfeatures:\n\n  * Access to Amazon Prime Instant Video – a film and TV streaming service\n  * Access to the Kindle eBook library\n  * Access to Amazon Prime Music – a music streaming service with 2 million tracks\n  * 30-minute early access to Lightning Deals – time-limited special offers on products\n  * Online photo storage with Amazon Drive\n\nThere’s a lot more, too. The company provides a full list of all the benefits\n[here](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201910360).\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nRelated: [Amazon Echo](https://www.trustedreviews.com/amazon-echo-review)\n\n![Amazon\nlogo](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Amazon Prime – How much does it cost?\n\nAnyone signing up to the service for the first time can take advantage of the\n30-day free trial. After that you’ve got a choice of how you pay.\n\nAmazon offers either a monthly subscription fee of £7.99 per month or an\nannual fee of £79. If you’re planning on sticking with the service for a year,\nthe annual option is the way to go as you’ll save around £20 – just remember\nto cancel after 12 months if you don’t want to be charged £79 again.\n\nThe monthly subscription works out to £95.88 for the year – though you do get\nthe added flexibility of cancelling at any point.\n\nRecently, Amazon also introduced an option to pay £5.99 per month for access\nto the video streaming service only. This doesn’t come with any of the other\nPrime benefits, however.\n\n[**Get a free 30-day Amazon Prime trial**](http://amzn.to/2tI1LZb)\n\n**If you’re a bit confused by it all, here’s how the pricing options break\ndown:**\n\n|  Video only | Prime | Prime (annual)  \n---|---|---|---  \nPrice | £5.99/month | £7.99/month | £79/year  \nUnlimited One-Day Delivery | No | Yes | Yes  \nUnlimited movies and TV shows | Yes | Yes | Yes  \nSecure unlimited photo storage | No | Yes | Yes  \nEarly access to Lightning Deals | No | Yes | Yes  \nAd-free music streaming. | No | Yes | Yes  \nFirst month free | Yes | Yes | Yes  \nCancel any time | Yes | Yes | Yes  \n  \n## Amazon Prime – Free One-Day Delivery\n\nIf you’re not a Prime member, Amazon still offers its Super Saver delivery\noption on orders above £20, which means you won’t pay for delivery, but you’ll\nhave to wait 3-5 business days for your order to arrive. Here’s how Amazon\ndescribes it:\n\n“Orders including £10 or more of eligible books, dispatched by Amazon, qualify\nfor FREE Delivery. All orders of £20 or more of eligible items, dispatched by\nAmazon, across any product category also qualify for FREE Delivery. With FREE\nDelivery, your order will be delivered 3-5 business days after all of your\nitems are available to be dispatched, including pre-order items.”\n\n![Amazon\nlogo](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nWith Prime, you’ll get free delivery on thousands of items, but they’ll turn\nup at your door either on the day you order (for selected post codes), or the\nnext day. Same-day delivery from non-Prime members costs £3.95 for clothes,\nshoes and bags, £5.99 for media, and £7.99 for anything else.\n\nFree same-day delivery is a pretty handy benefit for those that order often\nfrom the site, but if you only use Amazon every now and then, you might be\nbetter sticking with the Super Saver option, which requires no subscription,\nand paying for the one-day or same-day delivery option when needed.\n\nTo give you an idea of whether the free delivery alone is worth the £79 annual\ncost, here’s what you’d need to order on One-Day delivery or Priority delivery\n(2 business days) to offset the fee. Either:\n\n  * 20 or more orders of clothes at £3.95\n  * 14 or more orders of media at £5.99\n  * 10 orders of any other eligible items at £7.99\n\nAnd for Express delivery, which costs £8.99 per order, and ensures your order\narrives before 1pm the next day, you’d have to make nine Express orders to go\npast the £79 threshold. Prime members can make use of Express delivery’s 1pm\npromise for £4.49.\n\n## Amazon Prime – Prime Video\n\nWe’ve got a whole guide to how Amazon Video compares to Netflix (follow the\nlink below), but here’s a quick breakdown of the service in comparison to its\ncompetitors.\n\n**Related:[Netflix vs Amazon\nVideo](https://www.trustedreviews.com/g00/opinions/netflix-vs-amazon-prime-\ninstant-video?i10c.referrer=)**\n\n**[![Apple TV Amazon\nPrime](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)](https://www.trustedreviews.com/g00/opinions/netflix-vs-\namazon-prime-instant-video?i10c.referrer=)**\n\nPrice-wise, Netflix starts at £5.99 per month, but that won’t get you HD\ncontent. The standard package from Netflix is the one worth getting, which\nprovides HD TV and films for £7.99 per month. Add that up over 12 months and\nyou’re paying £89.88.\n\nThat’s a full £10 more than the £79 annual fee for Prime, and you’ll also get\nall the extra benefits that come with Prime membership.\n\nAnd while there used to be a significant disparity when it came to the\navailable content on each service, Amazon has managed to significantly bulk up\nits content offerings in recent years. With that in mind, it’s hard not to\nrecommend the service as a serious competitor to Netflix.\n\nElsewhere, Now TV charges £9.99 per month for its cinema pass, or £6.99 for\nits entertainment pass, which, while not a bad offer for content that tends to\nbe a bit newer than what you’ll find on Prime Video, is still significantly\nmore than the £79 annual Prime fee – which, again, offers you a range of\ngenuinely useful extras.\n\n## Amazon Prime – Prime Music\n\nPrime Music is Amazon’s entry-level music streaming service, and Prime members\nget access as part of their membership. It doesn’t boast the full 40 million-\nsong catalogue of the company’s full Spotify rival, Amazon Music Unlimited,\nbut it does come with a rotating catalogue of 2 million songs that can be\ndownloaded for offline listening and added to your personal library and\nplaylists.\n\n**Related:[Amazon Prime Music vs Amazon Music\nUnlimited](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/amazon-prime-music-unlimited-\nvs-prime-music)**\n\n**[![Amazon Prime\nMusic](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/amazon-prime-\nmusic-unlimited-vs-prime-music)**\n\nOn top of that, you can stream all the music you like ad-free. While rivals\nsuch as Spotify and Deezer offer free streaming plans, you’ll have to put up\nwith promotional content between songs. Not so with Amazon’s service.\n\nAnd if you find the 2 million songs aren’t enough, as a Prime member you can\nsign up to the full Amazon Music Unlimited service for an extra £7.99 per\nmonth, which would usually cost non-Prime members £9.99. Spotify, on the other\nhand, will charge you £9.99 for its ad-free service – even then, there’s 30\nmillion songs on offer, compared to Amazon Music Unlimited’s 40 million.\n\n## Is Amazon Prime worth it?\n\nThere’s a host of other extra features that make Prime membership a very\ntempting offer indeed. Whether it’s worth signing up, however, will come down\nto whether you’ll user those extras, and how often you order from the site.\n\nThose looking for new music and film and TV streaming options will certainly\nappreciate the Prime Video and Prime music access, and if you order frequently\nfrom the site, too, it makes this one a no-brainer – especially if you sign up\nfor the £79 annual membership which works out cheaper than the standard\nNetflix membership over 12 months and packs a load more benefits.\n\nHowever, if you hardly ever order from Amazon, and you’re not interested in\nthe the main extras, i.e. the streaming services, you might consider giving\nPrime a miss.\n\n**Get now at[Amazon.co.uk](http://amzn.to/2to4N4F) / [Amazon.com\n](http://amzn.to/2tocUy4)**\n\n**Prime customer?
