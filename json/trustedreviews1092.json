They’re working to bring to market a new tech called MicroLED.This is where Samsung finally drops LCD and adopts an emissive technology,similar to OLED and plasma before it. Samsung says it will be less power-hungry than OLED, with less potential for degradation over time. This is aboutas close to the ‘true’ QLED that folks on the internet have been speculatingabout for years, before Samsung decided to use ‘QLED’ to brand its Quantum DotLCD TVs.Micro LED stems from Samsung’s existing LED Cinema technology, which usesmodular LED panels pieced together to create a gigantic picture. The theoryhere is the same: at CES 2018 Samsung is showing off a 146-inch modularversion that it calls ‘The Wall’. It’s not been announced how the modularsystem works, or what sizes will be available, but it’s safe to say Samsung isstarting big before working down to sensible (affordable) sizes.When? The estimates are anywhere from one to nine years…## Samsung’s future is bright. And crazyI’ve got to give it to Samsung. The 2017 QLED plan didn’t go as intended, butthe guys in Seoul clearly weren’t disheartened. It’s quite the opposite –they’ve doubled down on their commitment to fight OLED on several fronts. Someof the plan is practical. Some of the plan is plain mad. But from what I’veseen, all of it is hugely impressive.It’s clear that to Samsung, the big ‘OLED vs QLED’ debate is only justbeginning.**Since you’re looking at TVs, check out our coverage of the other brands:****[Sony TVs 2018: What you need to know before you buy Bravia  ](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/sony-bravia-tvs-2951944)**[**Panasonic’s2018 4K HDR and HD TV lineup explained  **](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/panasonic-tvs-2018-4k-hdr-oled-2952995)[**LG’s 2018 OLED TVs**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/new-lg-2018-oled-tv-models-specs-price-release-date-3367924)_What do you make of Samsung’s OLED-fighting plans?
