We’ve got you covered with our list of the best\nGalaxy S9 deals**\n\nNothing moves slowly on the smartphone market and in the six months since the\nSamsung Galaxy S9 was released, a lot has changed. Apple has since thrown its\nlatest devices into the ring with the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, while\nGoogle has only just unveiled the [Pixel\n3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-3) (finally), which is\nimminently due for release.\n\n**Jump to:How to choose the right Galaxy S9 deal for you**\n\nWhile still being a great top-tier smartphone, the Samsung Galaxy S9 will now\nhave a harder time than ever in the fight for your pocket space.

This enables you to take even better\nlow-light images than before.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThink of this feature as operating a bit like your pupils. It dilates when\nit’s dark, scooping up as much available light as possible. When there’s\nplenty of light around, on the other hand, it will contract.\n\nBeing able to open up to a wide f/1.5 aperture also creates the possibility\nfor some gorgeous bokeh, which is that blurred-out background effect you get\nwith high quality cameras. It really serves to make your subjects pop on the\nGalaxy S9.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAnother new camera feature is super slow-motion mode, which can capture 960fps\nfootage. This means that you can capture 0.2 seconds of real-time action and\nslow it down to 6 seconds of dramatic slo-mo footage.\n\nIt’s not exactly new, but the Samsung Galaxy S9’s super AMOLED display\ncontinues to be the best in the field, while the bezels that surround it have\ngotten even thinner. You also get the addition of Dolby Atmos stereo speakers,\nwhich have been tuned by AKG. It results in way better audio than any previous\nGalaxy S phone.\n\nSamsung’s new AR Emoji may well get you excited too, as they let you create\ncustomised animated emoji with your own face. Samsung has also partnered with\nDisney on a range of AR Emoji featuring characters from the famous animation\ncompany.\n\n* * *\n\n## How to pick the best Galaxy S9 deal for you\n\n![Samsung Galaxy\nS9](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Decide what you’re willing to pay upfront\n\nThe upfront cost is what you pay at the beginning of your contract for your\nshiny new phone. As a general rule of thumb, the more you can pay upfront, the\nless you’ll pay overall. The overall cost is known as the total cost of\nownership (TCO), and this is your monthly charge multiplied by the length of\nyour contract plus the upfront cost.\n\nSo a £30pm contract that lasts 24 months with a £100 upfront cost would equate\nto (£30 x 24) + £100 = £820.\n\nBut what you’re willing to pay upfront will be down to personal circumstance.\nIt’s not the end of the world paying slightly more after two years if that’s\nthe difference between having the smartphone of your dreams… and not.\n\n### How much data do you need?\n\nData is the biggest differentiator between one tariff and the next. No one\nreally cares how many call minutes or texts they get, as they’re no longer as\nimportant. Most contracts will give you far more than you’ll ever need.\n\nNowadays, data allowance is the biggest commodity. Data is needed to let you\nbrowse the web, stream video or music and use apps like WhatsApp to send and\nreceive messages or make video calls. Light users will typically get away with\n4-10GB of data, but anyone who is a heavy streamer will likely want more.\n\nTethering your data connection is also a great way to make use of any excess\nminutes. You can turn on the mobile hotspot on your Galaxy S9 and share your\ninternet with another device like a tablet or laptop. That’s great if you’re\nworking on the move.\n\nBe sure to compare the higher data tariffs against the lower options, too.\nOften, you can pay the same price a month and get more data, and there’s\nreally no reason not to opt for the bigger package if the price is the same.\nIt gets you peace of mind that you won’t run out, and you never know when you\nmight become engrossed by a new Netflix show that you absolutely must stream\nwhile on your morning commute.\n\n### How to choose the right mobile network\n\nWhen it comes to deciding which network provider to side with, you’re so\nspoilt for choice that the process can seem rather daunting. Every provider is\nvying for your attention and they’ll do all that they can to get it. Luckily\nfor you however, we’ve narrowed down the best perks and packages to suit\neveryone from the data junkie to the long-distance caller.\n\n### Three\n\nThree’s Go Binge service is its big selling point. This means apps like\nNetflix and Apple Music don’t count against your data allowance. Considering\nstreaming films off Netflix can take a massive dent, that’s a great incentive.\nIt can mean the difference between needing to opt for a low data package\nversus a more expensive big data package. It can also mean you don’t use up\nall of your data a week into the billing month, potentially leaving you\nsitting there twiddling your thumbs until it renews (or you fork out more\nmoney).\n\n### Vodafone\n\nVodafone has tariffs like Red Entertainment, which includes free subscriptions\nto the likes of NOW TV, Spotify Premium or Sky Sports Mobile TV. Considering\nSpotify normally costs £9.99 a month, that’s a massive saving over the course\nof your contract. If you already want one of these services, it’s worth\nfactoring this when picking your provider.\n\nRecently, Vodafone also bolstered its roaming options, now letting you use\nyour home network plan in an expanded 77 countries abroad for those on certain\npackages (such as Red Entertainment). If you’re a regular traveller, this\nmight help set Vodafone apart, as otherwise using your phone abroad can be\nvery costly.\n\n### O2\n\nO2 Refresh is a great incentive. This splits your monthly bill into\nessentially two payments: the cost of your phone, and then your service plan.\nOnce you’ve paid off the cost of your phone, your monthly bill will reduce.\nYou can also choose to trade in your phone to upgrade to a newer model at any\ntime. Great if you always need the latest and greatest, and the idea of using\nthe same phone for 24 months doesn’t appeal.\n\nThere are also flexible contracts that let you adjust your airtime tariff up\nor down once a month. Great if you need the flexibility.\n\n### EE\n\nEE offers six months free Apple Music and three months of BT Sports on mobile\nas part of most of its packages. It also has the biggest 4G coverage in the UK\n(in its own words), which is great.\n\n### iD\n\nIf you find yourself not using all of your data each month, it won’t go to\nwaste with iD Mobile. That’s because handily anything not used rolls over to\nthe next month.\n\n### Make sure you check mobile coverage\n\nDeciding which provider to go with based on the amount of data they offer is a\nfrequent occurrence in the modern age. Before you make that choice however,\nyou should check to see how well each provider fares in covering your local\narea. As we all know, there’s nothing worse than failing to update your\nInstagram story with the next great shot because of a lousy signal.\n\nCheck the links below to see which of the main providers offer the best\ncoverage for you:\n\n  * [O2 network coverage checker](https://www.o2.co.uk/coveragechecker)\n  * [Vodafone network coverage checker](https://www.vodafone.co.uk/explore/network/uk-coverage-map/index.htm)\n  * [EE network coverage checker](https://ee.co.uk/why-ee/mobile-coverage)\n  * [Three network coverage checker](http://www.three.co.uk/Discover/Network/Coverage)\n  * [iD network coverage checker](https://www.idmobile.co.uk/help-and-advice/uk-coverage-checker)\n\n### **Wi-Fi calling**\n\nIf you find yourself in a place with no network coverage but a solid Wi-Fi\nconnection, you can use Wi-Fi Calling to still make and receive calls and text\nmessages. This uses an internet connection instead of cellular coverage, and\nthe calls and minutes just come out of your regular tariff allowance. It can\nget you out of a bind and is a great option for places that traditionally have\nbad coverage, such as a basement.\n\n### Keep your phone number\n\nHappy with the fact that you’ve finally remembered your mobile number off by\nheart? Well there’s nothing stopping you from keeping that number when you\nchange to a new network provider – and the process couldn’t be easier. All you\nhave to do is get in contact with your previous provider and ask them for your\nPAC code. Once it’s been sent over, simply tell your new provider what the PAC\ncode is and you’ll be back to reciting your old number before you know it.\n\n_We may earn a commission if you click a deal and buy an item.
