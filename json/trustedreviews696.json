The Japanese Studio is beloved\nacross the globe nowadays, so there’s plenty of anticipation for Sekiro.\n\nPublished by Activision, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is an action RPG with the\nquick and precise combat you’d expect FromSoftware to produce. However, this\ntale seems to focus on a far deeper narrative across an archaic Japanese\nsetting. Either way, it’s shaping up nicely.\n\n**Read on for everything you need to know about Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice\nincluding the release date, latest news, and our hands-on gameplay preview.**\n\n## Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice Gameplay Preview\n\nFromSoftware’s latest effort challenges almost everything I’ve come to know\nabout Bloodborne and Dark Souls, twisting my perspective into one that forced\nme to think and fight differently than before.\n\nYet it still possesses the same DNA, bearing a heavy, precise combat system\nand a wonderful sense of exploration across a mythical depiction of Japan.\nHaving spent 30 minutes with Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, it may have already\nstaked a claim as one of 2019’s finest action games.\n\nSet in the closing years of Japan’s Sengoku period, you play as a mysterious\nninja who has been resurrected and cast out on a mission of revenge. He’s\nsilent, brooding and happily willing to murder all in his path.\n\nAnd you do just that. My 30-minute demo began with me perched upon a tree\nbranch, and a tutorial providing instructions on how to plunge my sword into\nthe guard waiting below. After this, I was on my own. Much like the Soulsborne\ntitles that came before, Sekiro is least interested in holding the player’s\nhand.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n**Related:**[ **Upcoming PS4\nGames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/upcoming-ps4-games-3530401)\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThis unforgiving difficulty doesn’t mean you’re left without a means of\ndefence, though. In fact, it’s quite the opposite. Our hero is equipped with a\nstandard katana and a makeshift arm that doubles as a multitude of different\ntools.\n\nIt can be used as a grappling hook, which feels incorporated into every facet\nof Sekiro. Whether it’s a way to traverse rooftops, ambush enemies, discover\nsecrets or, in larger battles, performing unique attacks awash with spectacle.\n\nThe best part? It feels incredible in action, having already justified itself\nas a central mechanic. One of my demo highlights was an encounter that saw me\nfacing off against a looming demon locked up in wooden stocks. He packed a\nheavy punch, but I was able to use my grappling hook to pull him towards the\nground, opening up avenues of attack previously unknown.\n\nSekiro spices up the combat model further by abandoning the stamina gauge and\nplacing a greater focus on precision and accounting for enemy equipment. I\ndidn’t stand a chance against an Armoured General as I had no idea of his\nweaknesses, leading to multiple deaths and avoiding him altogether.\n\nI imagine that in the full experience you’ll slowly chip away at enemies until\nthey’re nothing but a crimson stain on your blade. However, you’ll also need\nto contend with a stagger metre of sorts, which, once filled, opens up both\nyou and the enemy for a devastating special attack. Not only do they look\nstylish, but they act as a sufficient reward in the act of attrition many\nfights evolve into.\n\n**Related:**[ **Best Xbox One\nGames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/xbox-one-games-3435271)\n\n![sekiro shadows die\ntwice](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nYour left arm can be customised with different secondary weapons, representing\na heavy attack that, when used correctly, is perfect for leaving foes\nvulnerable. My favourite was a flamethrower that could leave enemies stumbling\ndesperately to fan the flames, providing a few precious seconds to take a\nslash. There’s also the Loaded Axe, which can stun enemies with a swift slam,\nalthough it takes time to wind up.\n\nDark Souls and Bloodborne are renown of robbing you of everything you have\nupon death, forcing you to return to a resting place to receive well-earned\nspoils. Sekiro does away with this notion and even allows you to immediately\nresurrect upon defeat before facing death. This is a huge departure, giving\nyou a few precious seconds to rethink a strategy before facing an enemy again.\n\nClashing swords is a focal point of Sekiro, since the majority of foes wield a\nsaber of sorts ready to thrust at you. A rhythmic touch of the shoulder button\ninitiates a parry, leaving enemies vulnerable to a devastating attack, or even\na one-shot kill in some instances. FromSoftware has dabbled in this part of\ncombat before, but never to such a detailed extent. How this will develop\nacross the entire journey is very exciting.\n\n**Related:**[ **Nvidia 2080**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/nvidia-\ngeforce-rtx-2080-specs-price-2952823)\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSekiro: Shadows Die Twice has its fair share of breathtaking boss encounters,\nand I’ve already witnessed two of them. The first was a giant snake, the size\nof a skyscraper. Upon hearing a rumbling amidst the cliffs upon which I was\nperched, I knew something was wrong. After a few more seconds, the scaled\ncreature lunged at me with fangs at the ready.\n\nI managed to hide in a nearby cave, where I was shortly murdered by a headless\ntroll – arguably a better way to go. The second was a corrupted monk, with\nthree forms to contend with. I managed to conquer the first, but within\nseconds he’d filled the screen with mist, the monk attacking me in the form of\na spooky spectre. Unfortunately, I died in seconds.\n\nEncounters such as this feel like a dynamic part of Sekiro, which itself is an\nintricate painting of intertwining areas and a mixture of historical\narchitecture and dark, mythical monsters. I adore it and hope the full game is\njust as good.\n\n## First Impressions\n\nSekiro: Shadows Die Twice is much more than another Dark Souls or Bloodborne.\n\nFromSoftware has adapted the masterful combat system it has spent years\nrefining and made it faster and more satisfying, with multiple elements that\nfeel akin to a well-oiled machine. Everything just works, and I felt at home\nwithin minutes of picking up the controller.\n\nWhether this will be a more a linear effort with a greater focus on narrative\nremains to be seen, but I’m intrigued to see how Sekiro aims to differ from\nthe efforts that have come before it. For now, this is definitely one to\nwatch.\n\n## What is Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice?\n\nSekiro: Shadows Die Twice is an action RPG starring a mysterious ninja with a\nprosthetic arm, a limb which will have mechanical importance in gameplay. For\nexample, it can be used as a grappling hook or swung around to stun and\ndistract incoming enemies. Combat is brutal, bloody and wonderfully\nsatisfying, judging by the debut trailer.\n\nShadows Die Twice is directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki, the same mastermind behind\nclassics such as Demon’s Souls, Dark Souls and Bloodborne. Fans worried that\nthe beloved formula is being abandoned can rest easy knowing this. It’s also\npublished by Activision, the company behind blockbusters like Destiny and Call\nof Duty.\n\n**Related:[Best PS4\nGames](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/ps4-games-3431751)**\n\n![sekiro shadows die\ntwice](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n“Collaborating with Activision on Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice has been a very\nexciting experience for us,” Miyazaki said. “With Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice\nmany FromSoftware team members, including myself, are thrilled to be exploring\nthemes of Sengoku Japan and ninja for the first time. We can’t wait for\neveryone to discover what’s in store for the game.”\n\n## Shadows Die Twice release date – When’s it out?\n\nSekiro: Shadows Die Twice is due to release for PS4, Xbox One and PC on March\n22, 2019. It appears FromSoftware is eager to follow a similar release window\nto Bloodborne, and who are we to turn them down?\n\n> Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice will be released worldwide on 22nd March, 2019. We\nhope you look forward to it.\n[pic.twitter.com/VX8wQYxpMw](https://t.co/VX8wQYxpMw)\n\n>\n\n> — FROMSOFTWARE (@fromsoftware_pr) [August 20,\n2018](https://twitter.com/fromsoftware_pr/status/1031587700497887232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n## Shadows Die Twice trailers\n\n**Does Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice look exciting to you?
