He says the flaw in the API could\nenable third-parties to commandeer the device.\n\n**Related:[Google Home Hub vs Amazon Echo\nShow](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-home-hub-vs-amazon-echo-\nshow-3602099)**\n\nIn the [blog post](https://jerrygamblin.com/2018/10/29/google-home-\ninsecurity/) (via [9to5Google](https://9to5google.com/2018/10/30/google-home-\ninsecure/)) he wrote: “I am genuinely shocked by how poor the overall security\nof these devices are, even more so when you see that these endpoints have been\nknown for years and relatively well documented.”\n\n> I am not an IOT security expert, but I am pretty sure an unauthenticated\ncurl statement should not be able to reboot the\n[@madebygoogle](https://twitter.com/madebygoogle?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) home\nhub.

It says the claim is inaccurate and says the API in\nquestion pertains to the mobile apps used to configure Home devices, and\nrequires the devices are on the same wireless network.\n\nThe company says: “All Google Home devices are designed with user security and\nprivacy top of mind and use a hardware-protected boot mechanism to ensure that\nonly Google-authenticated code is used on the device. In addition, any\ncommunication carrying user information is authenticated and encrypted.\n\n“A recent claim about security on Google Home Hub is inaccurate. The APIs\nmentioned in this claim are used by mobile apps to configure the device and\nare only accessible when those apps and the Google Home device are on the same\nWi-Fi network. Despite what’s been claimed, there is no evidence that user\ninformation is at risk.”\n\n**Are you happy to have a device like the Amazon Echo or Google Home in your\nhome?
