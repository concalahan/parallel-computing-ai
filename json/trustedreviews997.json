But what’s the difference? Is it just that one’s bigger? We\ntake a look.**\n\nIt’s finally here. After months of rumours and speculation, the Galaxy S8 has\narrived, and it’s pretty much exactly what we were expecting. Which isn’t\nreally a bad thing – the S8 is a design triumph, with its barely there bezels\nand super-large display.\n\nAnd while we’re very taken with Samsung’s latest, we know many will be\nwondering what the difference is between the S8 and S8+. Is it simply down to\nthe dimensions, or does the “+” denote a greater number of upgrades?\n\nRead on for all the answers, or scroll down to the bottom of this page for a\nshorter summary.\n\n**Related:[Galaxy S8 vs Google\nPixel](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/galaxy-s8-vs-pixel)**\n\n## Galaxy S8 vs S8+ Design – What’s the difference?\n\nFirst up, let’s deal with the obvious. This year, the ‘Edge’ model has been\nreplaced by the ‘+’ offering. Why? Well, because this year, Samsung’s decided\nto stick **curved edges on both** **phones** , making the ‘Edge’ label\nredundant. Thus, the S8+ is the replacement for the former [S7\nEdge](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-s7-edge-review).\n\nThat means, this year, there’s even less difference between the two models\nthan before. Both come with curved-edge screens which Samsung has dubbed\n‘Infinity Display’ – owing to the increased screen size. And that enlarged\ndisplay area comes as a result of the company ditching the home button in\nfavour of smaller bezels and an edge-to-edge screen on both handsets.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nTo make space, the **fingerprint sensor has moved to the back** and stuck next\nto the camera. That’s not the most ideal placement, but you should get used to\nit after a while.\n\n**Related:[Best Android phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-android-\nphones-1_round-up)**\n\n![galaxys8\n15](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)_The S8 and S8+_\n\nIn addition to the fingerprint scanner, the **iris scanner from the Galaxy\nNote series** has finally made its way onto the Galaxy S range, in an upgraded\nform. You’ll find it on that ever so slight bezel at the top of the two\nphones, alongside the front-facing camera.\n\nSo, is there any actual difference between the S8 and S8+ in terms of design?\nWell, the only major one is the dimensions. The standard model comes in at\n140.1 x 72.2 x 7.3mm, while the Plus model measures 152.4 x 78.5 x 7.9mm.\n\nThe normal **Galaxy S8 has a 5.8-inch display** , while the **S8+ gets a huge\n6.2-inch screen**. Both phones have the same 1440 x 2960 resolution Super\nAMOLED panel, and they look fantastic **.**\n\n**\n\n  \n**\n\n![galaxys8\n17](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)_The S8+_\n\nThanks to Samsung’s usage of Super AMOLED tech once again this year, the\npixels will look incredibly vibrant, while blacks will be deep and inky,\nthanks to the screen’s ability to simply turn off individual pixels. There’s\nalso energy efficiency advantages that come with OLED panels, so both phones\nshouldn’t disappoint in the display stakes – especially with the Mobile HDR\nPremium feature that lets you watch HDR content.\n\nOther than that, the phones are identical, design-wise. Both come in either\n**dark black, bright silver, or a grey with a blueish tinge** and feature the\nsame, sleek chassis and glass panels. In other words, both phones look bloody\ngood, and seem to mark a turning point in smartphone design, after years of\nhandsets looking far too similar to each other.\n\n**Related:[Galaxy S7 review](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-\ngalaxy-s7-review)**\n\n## Galaxy S8 vs S8+ Specs: Which phone is the most powerful?\n\nSo, what about the hardware then? Any big differences here? Well, actually,\nno. But that’s not a bad thing. The main thing to be aware of here is that\nthese may be the fastest phones available right now. Both the S8 and S8+ are\nflagship devices, and pack in the latest hardware and software. They will\nalmost certainly provide the smoothest performance you can buy, at least for\nnow.\n\nFirst of all, the S8 and S8+ will have different processors depending on which\ncountry you’re in. Those in the USA will be getting Qualcomm’s latest\nSnapdragon 835 chip, which comes with a load of new technology such as 25%\nbetter energy efficiency over the Snapdragon 820, Bluetooth 5 support, better\ngraphics, and of course a more powerful octa-core CPU.\n\n**Related:[Galaxy S8 vs Galaxy\nS7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s8-vs-galaxy-s7)**  \n![galaxys8\n7](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)_The S8_\n\nIf you’re in the UK, other parts of Europe, and Asia however, the S8 and S8+\ncome with Samsung’s own Exynos 8895 chipset. But don’t worry – both Qualcomm\nand Sammy’s chips offer the latest innovations and are built using the new\n10nm process, so you’re not going to see a massive difference in performance\nbetween models from different regions. And, there certainly won’t be any\ndifference in performance between the Galaxy S8 and S8+.\n\n### Get this Samsung Galaxy S8 Deal\n\n[](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3202&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-\nflamingos8&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fcontract%2Fsamsung-\ngalaxy-s8-black%2F32-essential-8gb-ayce-min-24mths-24%3F)\n\n[](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3202&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-\nflamingos8&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fcontract%2Fsamsung-\ngalaxy-s8-black%2F32-essential-8gb-ayce-min-24mths-24%3F)\n\n###\n\n[Samsung Galaxy S8 for £32/month, £144 upfront from Three\n\n](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3202&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-\nflamingos8&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fcontract%2Fsamsung-\ngalaxy-s8-black%2F32-essential-8gb-ayce-min-24mths-24%3F)\n\nWith unlimited calls, unlimited texts and 8GB of data every month.\n\n[BuyMobiles.net\n\n](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3202&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-\nflamingos8&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fcontract%2Fsamsung-\ngalaxy-s8-black%2F32-essential-8gb-ayce-min-24mths-24%3F)\n\n[View\nDeal](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3202&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-\nflamingos8&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fcontract%2Fsamsung-\ngalaxy-s8-black%2F32-essential-8gb-ayce-min-24mths-24%3F)\n\n[BuyMobiles.net\n\n](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3202&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-\nflamingos8&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fcontract%2Fsamsung-\ngalaxy-s8-black%2F32-essential-8gb-ayce-min-24mths-24%3F)\n\nBacking up that processor in both handsets is **4GB of RAM** , which should\nprovide more than enough memory power to keep the user experience fluid and\nglitch-free. There’s also **64GB of internal storage** , which is a decent\namount considering it took Apple until last year to ditch its positively\nabject 16GB memory tier. There’s also a **Micro SD card slot** for those\nlooking to expand the internal storage up to 256GB.\n\nThe only major difference to note between the S8 and S8+ is the battery size.\nOn the **Galaxy S8 has a 3000mAh battery** , while the **Galaxy S8+ comes with\na 3500mAh** cell. With a bigger display on the latter, that extra battery\npower will be needed, and in the aggregate, it will likely mean both phones\noffer similar battery life. We are slightly concerned the S8 won’t go a day\nwith that bigger screen sucking up the charge, but we’ll have more once we’ve\nfully reviewed the phone.\n\n**Related:[Best Samsung S8 Plus\nDeals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/best-samsung-galaxy-s8-plus-\ndeals)**  \n![s8plusbeware\n25](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)_The S8+_\n\nYou’ll find a **12-megapixel camera on the back of both models**. That’s the\nsame megapixel count as last year, along with an f/1.7 aperture and optical\nimage stabilisation (OIS). Not much has changed since last year, but seeing as\nthe Galaxy S7 had the best smartphone camera available, we’re not too\nbothered.\n\nAn upgrade would have been nice, but as it stands, the camera on the S8 will\ntake some of the best photos of any smartphone. Samsung has added a new\nfeature that means the phone takes three pictures every time you hit the\nshutter, which it says reduces blur and makes for better shots. Beyond that,\nit seems not much has changed.\n\nRound the front, both the S8 and S8+ come with an 8-megapixel shooter with an\nf/1.7 aperture and autofocus. It’s a decent enough offering that should\nprovide some decent selfie-performance.\n\nOverall, then, there’s little difference between the two phones in terms of\nhardware. A bigger size, bigger screen, and bigger battery on the S8+ is the\nlong and short of it. It’s also worth being aware that both phones come with\nfull IP68 waterproofing, along with a USB Type-C port and wireless charging.\nSammy’s thought of everything this year!  \n[**  \n**](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=380&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-\ndealsrtextlink-S8preorder&p=https://www.mobiles.co.uk/samsung-\ngalaxy-s8-midnight-black?tariffcode=AE4YMMAR17)**For a full spec comparison,\ncheck out the table below:**\n\n|  Galaxy S8 | Galaxy S8 Plus  \n---|---|---  \n**Screen** |  5.8 inches | 6.2 inches  \n**Display Resolution** |  1440 x 2960 pixels | 1440 x 2960 pixels  \n**Screen-to-body Ratio** |  84.4% | 88.6%  \n**Aspect Ratio** |  18.5:9 Infinity Display | 18.5:9 Infinity Display  \n**Dimensions** |  148.9 x 68.1 x 8.0mm | 159.5 x 73.4 x 8.1mm  \n**Chipset** |  Qualcomm Snapdragon 835/Exynos 8895 | Qualcomm Snapdragon\n835/Exynos 8895  \n**RAM** |  4GB | 4GB  \n**Storage** |  64GB – expandable | 64GB – expandable  \n**Rear Camera** |  12-megapixel OIS, f/1.7 | 12-megapixel OIS, f/1.7  \n**Front Camera** |  8-megapixel, f/1.7 auto focus | 8-megapixel, f/1.7 auto\nfocus`  \n**Battery Size** |  3000mAh | 3500mAh  \n**Charging** |  Fast battery charging, Wireless | Fast battery charging,\nWireless  \n**Headphone Jack** |  Yes | Yes  \n**Waterproof** |  Yes (IP68 Certified) | Yes (IP68 Certified)  \n**Connectivity** |  Wi-Fi, 4G/LTE, USB-C | Wi-Fi, 4G/LTE, USB-C  \n**Colours** |  Midnight, Grey and silver | Midnight, Grey and silver  \n  \n**Related:[Best Android apps ](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-android-\napps_round-up)**\n\n## Galaxy S8 vs S8+ OS: Which phone has better software?\n\nYou’ll find Google’s latest mobile OS on both the S8 and S8+: **Android 7.0\nNougat**. It’s a great entry in the Android series that keeps everything good\nabout the operating system and adds a load of new features to improve overall\nfunctionality. You’ll find richer drop-down menus, enhanced gaming support\nwith the addition of Vulkan, and multi-window multi-tasking. There’s also a\nnew Doze function for conserving battery power, and revised notifications that\noffer more options to interact with apps from the notification menu.\n\nFor a full breakdown of features, check out our comprehensive **[Android 7.0\nNougat review.](https://www.trustedreviews.com/android-7-0-nougat-review)**\n\n![s8plusbeware\n7](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)_The S8+_\n\nIn all, it’s a great OS that should run at lightning speed on the S8 and S8+’s\ntop-end hardware. But there is, of course the matter of TouchWiz. That’s\nSamsung’s proprietary Android skin that it likes to plaster over the stock OS.\nLast year the company managed to streamline the whole thing a bit more, so it\nwasn’t so intrusive.\n\nWe actually found the user experience to be an all-round pretty good one. This\nyear, we’re yet to try out Samsung’s latest attempt at an Android skin, but\nwe’re hoping it picks up where it left off last year and gets rid of unwanted\napps and superfluous extra features.\n\nIt’s worth noting the larger S8+ might be slightly better if you like having\napps side-by-side at the same time, but the experience is otherwise identical.\n\nThere is one more software element that’s worth being aware of here. **Bixby\nis Samsung’s own AI assistant** , and it makes its debut on the Galaxy S8 and\nS8+. Sammy looks to be taking on Google with its Google Assistant and Amazon’s\nAlexa with this latest software project, and it looks like the company has a\nlot to offer.\n\nSamsung says Bixby will arrive in Europe later this year, while the US and\nKorea will get support from launch. It looks like an exciting addition to the\nsoftware that offers help throughout the various apps. There’s also a new\nfeature that lets you use the phones’ cameras to scan items and search online\nfor the best price.\n\nThere’s also the new DeX docking station which is basically Samsung’s attempt\nto mimic Microsoft’s Continuum feature. But this attempt actually works. The\nS8 and S8+ plug into an HDMI monitor via the dock for a desktop-like\nexperience. It’s a useful feature that lets you turn your phone into a\nportable desktop computer – though, just who will take full advantage of such\na thing remains unclear.\n\n## Galaxy S8 vs S8+ Price: Which phone is better value for money?\n\nThe Galaxy S8 will go on sale for £689 on April 28 while the S8+ will arrive\non the same date for £779. Considering the S8+ simply offers a bigger screen,\nwe’re not sure the extra cost is really worth it.\n\n![galaxys8\n5](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)The S8\n\nBut, if you do like a bigger screen, there’s less than £100 difference between\nthe two phones. We’d still go with the more refined standard model, but it’s\nnot a whole lot more to pay for a larger screen if you desperately need one.\n\n**Buy Now:[Samsung Galaxy S8 (20GB ) at Buymobiles.net for £38/month, £44.99\nupfront](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3202&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-\nbuylinkplacements&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fcontract%2Fsamsung-\ngalaxy-s8-black%2Fee-max-plan-20gb-38-24mths-24)**\n\n**Buy Now:[Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus (30GB) at Buymobiles.net for £41/month, £20\nupfront](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3202&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-\nbuylinkplacements&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buymobiles.net%2Fcontract%2Fsamsung-\ngalaxy-s8-plus-black%2F41-essential-30gb-ayce-min-24mths-24)**\n\n## Galaxy S8 vs S8+ Summary: What’s the difference?\n\nHere’s a brief overview of the key differences between the Galaxy S8 and\nGalaxy S8 Plus.\n\n**Design** : These phones are basically identical in terms of their\nappearance. The only difference is the size. The S8 measures 140.1 x 72.2 x\n7.3mm, while the Plus model measures 152.4 x 78.5 x 7.9mm. You’re essentially\ngetting a bigger screen with the S8+, but other than that, the phones share a\nsleek and modern design.\n\n**Specs:** Same processor, same RAM, same storage options. The only difference\nhere is the battery, which is larger on the S8+ to accomodate that increased\nscreen size. Other than that, the camera is the same, the ports are the same,\nand both the S8 and S8+ come with IP68 waterproofing.  \n**  \nPrice:** The S8 will cost £689, while the S8+ will set you back £779\n\n**Value:** These are two expensive phones. You definitely get the best\nhardware for your money, but whether you want to spend around £700 on a phone\nwill depend on how much you intend to use it and what you want to use it for.\n\nWe’ll have more once we’ve reviewed both phones.\n\n**Which phone would you rather have?
