Us too. We tend to raise our voice to query the\nassistant, and Alexa is partial to shouting back at us too.**\n\nHowever, a greater level of decorum is possible from today, thanks to the roll\nout of the [whisper mode](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-whisper-\nmode-3594206), which Amazon announced at its hardware event last month.\n\nThe whisper mode is ideal for those late night or early morning queries you\nneed to make without disturbing those who may be in the land of nod. If you\nwhisper your command at an Echo device, Alexa will respond to you in kind.\n\n“Gone are the days of waking up your spouse or partner to ask Alexa for the\nweather in the morning or turn your alarm off. Whisper Mode is a new feature\nthat allows you to whisper to Alexa, and she will whisper her response back to\nyou,” Amazon says.\n\n**Related:[ Common Amazon Echo\nproblems](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/amazon-echo-\nproblems-2946622)**\n\nThe feature is only available in the US at present and Echo users will need to\nenable it before they can begin whispering sweet nothings to the personal\nassistant.\n\nIn the Alexa app, head to **Settings > Alexa Account > Alexa Voice Responses >\nWhisper Responses**. Once this is enabled, users can activate the feature by\nsaying **“Alexa turn on whisper mode.”**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n###  Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nShortly after Amazon announced the feature it published a blog post explaining\nhow the feature works; and it’s much more complicated than it would seem.\n\nAmazon scientist Zeynab Raeesy explained whispered speech is typically low\nenergy and unvoiced, meaning it lacks the vibration in the vocal chords. That\nmakes it much more difficult for a listening device like an Amazon Echo to\npick up the sounds effectively.\n\nRaeesy says Amazon compared the performance of two different neural networks\nin order to to distinguish between words spoken normally and those whispered.\nThey found a long short-term memory (LSTM) network performed better than\nmultilayer perceptron (MLP) network.\n\n**Have you taken Alexa’s new whisper mode for a spin yet?
