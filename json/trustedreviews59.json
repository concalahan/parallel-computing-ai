His co-founder Jessica Curry will now work as an independent\ncomposer, and the other members of staff were let go following the release of\nEveryone’s Gone to the Rapture last year _._\n\n“It’s really expensive running a studio,” Pinchbeck [told Eurogamer at the\ntime](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-09-25-the-doors-close-on-the-\nchinese-room-for-now). “We were 11 or 12 people at that point. You’re chewing\nthrough £35,000-£40,000 a month, which is pretty hefty.”\n\nThat same article name-checked another couple of games that the studio was\ncontinuing to work on: Little Orpheus and 13th Interior. It’s not clear\nwhether these will take priority under the new ownership, or whether The\nChinese Room will be encouraged to pursue new projects.\n\nSumo Digital, for its part, has plenty of projects on the go including [Team\nSonic Racing](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/team-sonic-racing), [Dead\nIsland 2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/dead-island-2-still-alive-\nkicking-deep-silver-confirms-3502779) and [Crackdown\n3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/crackdown-3).\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\n**Related:[Best PC games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-pc-\ngames-3520096)**\n\n“I’m thrilled to be joining Sumo Digital, a network of studios I’ve a huge\namount of respect for,” said Pinchbeck. “Sumo will provide the support and\nexperience I’m looking for to take The Chinese Room to the next level.”\n\nThe studio is working on new concepts, according to Pinchbeck, and is\ncontinuing to discuss current projects with partners. “The future for the\nstudio is incredibly exciting and being part of the Sumo family is absolutely\ncentral to that,” he added.\n\n**Does the future look bright for The Chinese Room?
