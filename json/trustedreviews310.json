This means that the chip can switch\nbetween four high-power Cortex-A15s and four energy-sipping Cortex-A7s\naccording to how demanding the task at hand is.\n\nSamsung has adopted a similar model for its own Exynos chips.\n\nWith Apple, Samsung, and now LG making their own SoCs, MediaTek providing a\nnumber of low-powered chips, and Nvidia returning with the impressive K1 that\npowers the [Nexus 9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-announces-htc-\nnexus-9-tablet-with-android-lollipop), it seems as if the mobile chip market\nwill be more fractured than ever over the coming years.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nQualcomm probably won’t have things quite so completely its own way as it has\nin recent times.\n\n**Read More:[Best Mobile Phone 2014](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-\nsmartphone_round-up)**\n\n"}
