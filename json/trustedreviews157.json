We take a closer\nlook at Daydream VR. Here’s everything you need to know, including all the\nlatest news on which phones and other devices support Daydream VR.  \n**  \nGoogle’s stepping up its VR game in 2017 – and no, we’re not just talking\nabout Cardboard.\n\nAt Google I/O 2016, the company unveiled an intriguing new VR project called\nDaydream, and it’s quite unlike anything we’ve seen elsewhere.\n\nThen, at its October 2016 event, Google announced the first Daydream VR\nheadset – the [Daydream View](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-vr-\nwireless-daydream-headset-release-date-uk-features-price) – and the first\nDaydream-compatible phone, the [Pixel.](https://www.trustedreviews.com/google-\npixel-review)\n\nNow, the Mountain View-based company has revealed plans to build [standalone\nGoogle VR headsets](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-vr-wireless-\ndaydream-headset-release-date-uk-features-price) – the first of which will be\ndeveloped in partnership with HTC and Qualcomm – as well as expanding Google\nDaydream support to devices like the [Galaxy\nS8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-s8-review) and [Galaxy S8\nPlus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-s8-plus-review).\n\nWhat’s more, we can expect to see a load of new Daydream-ready devices before\nthe end of the year according to Google CEO Sundar Pichai.\n\nHere’s all you need to know about Google’s VR plans.\n\n## What is Daydream VR?\n\nIn and of itself, Google Daydream isn’t a physical, standalone VR device –\nthough Google does make its own headset for use with Daydream-ready\nsmartphone, the Daydream View (more on that later).\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nIt’s a platform with a set of VR hardware standards for manufacturers to\nfollow, which combine with a new piece of hub software from Google itself.\n\nIt’s all intended to improve the VR experience on Android phones, and make VR\napps and VR video content more accessible to more people.\n\n**Related:[Best VR headset](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/best-vr-\nheadset)**\n\n![Daydream](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nGoogle Daydream won’t just provide yet another VR platform in an increasingly\nfragmented market. That’s not the point. Rather, the intention is that it will\npull together all of the content that already exists in some form on the\ninternet.\n\nThe hardware side of things includes a set of guidelines for a VR headset and\na motion controller, both of which Google has now revealed it will be\nmanufacturing with help from HTC (of [HTC\nVive](https://www.trustedreviews.com/htc-vive-review) fame) and Qualcomm,\nwhose [Snapdragon\n835](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/snapdragon-835-phones-processor-\nspecs-speed-benchmark-chipset-cores) SoC will sit at the heart of the first\nstandalone Google VR headset.\n\n## Google Daydream VR phones\n\nAt present, the following handsets are compatible with Daydream VR:\n\n  * Google Pixel\n  * [Google Pixel XL](https://www.trustedreviews.com/google-pixel-xl-review)\n  * [Moto Z](https://www.trustedreviews.com/moto-z-review)\n  * Samsung Galaxy S8 (coming summer)\n  * Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus (coming summer)\n  * ZTE Axon 7\n  * [Asus ZenFone AR  \n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/asus-zenfone-ar-review)\n\n  * LG’s “next 2017 flagship” (TBC, likely the LG V30)\n  * [Porsche Design Mate 9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/huawei-porsche-design-mate-9-review)\n  * [Huawei Mate 9 Pro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/huawei-mate-9-review)\n\nHowever, in an earnings call in July, Google CEO and board member of parent\ncompany Alphabet, Sundar Pichai, revealed more devices will be added to that\nlist soon.\n\nIn fact, according to Pichai, we can expect to see 11 smartphones arriving\nwith full Daydream support before the end of the year – leaving us to ask,\nwhat’s number 11 going to be?\n\nAll of the above phones are pretty much confirmed, which has us wondering\nwhether Daydream VR support will land on the forthcoming [Galaxy Note\n8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-8-release-date-\nspecs-rumours-price-uk-2993139) phablet, come to a previously released Moto\ndevice like the [Moto G5\nPlus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/moto-g5-plus), or shock us all\nand launch with the [iPhone\n8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-8-release-date-specs-rumours-\nprice-uk-2993101)?\n\nThe latter phone seems like a very remote possibility indeed, but at the very\nleast, we now know Daydream is coming at least one device we weren’t expecting\nthis year.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nNo doubt included in that list are the forthcoming [Pixel\n2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-pixel-2-release-date-specs-\nrumours-price-uk-xl-2951055) handsets, but it seems we can expect some as yet\nunannounced devices to crop up, too.\n\nAs mentioned, Samsung will be adding Daydream support to its Galaxy S8 and S8\nPlus, and we’d expect the forthcoming Note 8 to also feature the same\nfunctionality.\n\nMotorola may even opt to provide support for Google’s VR system on its\nupcoming Moto Z2 and Moto Z2 Force.\n\nAt this point, nothing more has been confirmed so we’ll have to wait and see\nwhat arrives in the coming months.\n\n## Daydream VR Headset\n\nGoogle announced the first Daydream VR headset, the Daydream View, back it\n2016. It’s made from breathable material, which Google says was inspired by\nwhat we wear.\n\nIt comes in three different colours, including slate (grey), snow (white) and\ncrimson (red). Like Gear VR, you slot your phone into the headset and use a\nprovided controller to interact with games and other content **.**\n\n![Google Daydream View\nprice](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe Daydream VR first went on sale in November 2016 for $79. In the UK, it\ncosts £70.\n\n**Buy Now:[Google Daydream View from Carphone\nWarehouse](https://www.carphonewarehouse.com/google/vr-daydream-view-\nslate.html#!colour=slate&dealType=sf)**  \n**  \n**\n\n## Daydream Controller\n\nIn addition to a headset, Google is also offering a reference design for a\nremote control device, one of which must ship with every Daydream headset. It\nlooks a bit like a Roku or [Apple TV](https://www.trustedreviews.com/apple-\ntv-2015-review) remote, but it has motion sensors built in.\n\nThanks to this feature, the remote responds to your hand movements much like a\nWii remote does. In this way the Daydream moves slightly beyond Samsung Gear\nVR – which relies on awkward physical headset controls for navigation – and\ncloser to the territory of the [Oculus\nRift](https://www.trustedreviews.com/oculus-rift-review) and the Vive.\n\n**Related:[What is virtual\nreality?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/what-is-virtual-reality)**\n\n![daydream](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIt’s used in navigation of the Daydream UI to physically point to and select\ncontent, and can also be used to pan through 360-degree video content when you\ndon’t want to physically spin around.\n\n## Daydream Home\n\nDaydream isn’t just about the headset and controller, of course. There’s also\na dedicated Daydream Home UI, which will enable you to browse and boot up VR\ncontent in a nice interface. It’s a bit like the Oculus VR app.\n\nIt also includes a tweaked version of the Google Play Store to provide VR\ncontent, complete with 360-degree preview images. You can find the likes of\nGoogle Photos, YouTube, and Gunjack VR in there.\n\n**Related:[LG 360 VR review](https://www.trustedreviews.com/lg-360-vr-\nreview)**\n\n![daydream](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nGoogle Street View and Play Movies is also present, and there’s support from\nUbisoft and Electronic Arts on the gaming front.\n\n## Daydream support and compatibility\n\nWe’ve already run through the devices that support Daydream VR, but in more\ngeneral terms, the platform currently requires top-end Android smartphones\nthat meet Google’s specifications.\n\nGoogle has also said it will enforce strict standards on the quality of the\nsensors and the speed of the display’s refresh rate.\n\nGoogle’s current Daydream VR hardware partners include: Samsung, HTC, LG,\nXiaomi, Huawei, ZTE, Asus and Alcatel.\n\n**Related:[How to turn your smartphone into a VR\nheadse](https://www.trustedreviews.com/how-tos/how-to-turn-your-phone-into-a-\nvr-headset)t**\n\n**Are you excited for standalone Google VR headsets?
