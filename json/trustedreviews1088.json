As prices tend to fluctuate, you’ll have to make a judgement call ifnow is the right time to snap one up.If it’s not the lowest price it’s ever been, but it’s not been discounted fora long time, it could still be a good time to jump in. You might also actuallyneed a product right now, so that will also help with the decision. It can beeasy to dilly-dally on a decision, but at the end of the day, it’s a personaldecision when to dive in.### Amazon Warehouse DealsDon’t forget about [Amazon Warehouse](https://amzn.to/2sE9fdt) deals, whichoffer discounts on used or open box items.
