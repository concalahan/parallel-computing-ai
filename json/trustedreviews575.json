She’s fast, responsive and\nincredibly malleable in the situations you can thrust her into and emerge\nvictoriously. She feels like an unusual mixture of McCree and Widowmaker,\nwielding the latter’s talent for long-ranged combat while adopting McCree’s\nwillingness to get up close and cause some trouble.\n\nWielding a rifle known as The Viper, Ashe’s primary form of attack is a\npowerhouse, and perhaps too powerful in the right hands. Being able to aim\ndown sights with the press of a button allows you to target enemies from a\ndistance, lining up headshots with little to no difficulty. She can also\nunload in close quarters due to how quickly a magazine can be spent.\n\nThe balance is incredibly satisfying. I found myself picking off Widowmaker\nfrom a distance before diving onto the point and going toe-to-toe with D.Va,\ntearing away her armour with a few rapid, well-timed shots. With a relatively\nsmall health limit, Ashe is still squishy and will die quickly if you’re\ncareless. So, it’s often wise to play from a distance and pick your moments to\ndive in\n\n**Related:**[ **Best Xbox One\nGames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/xbox-one-games-3435271)\n\n![Overwatch\nAshe](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nWhen things do get hairy, I found Ashe’s Coach Gun ability to be the perfect\navenue of escape. Not only does it hurl a bundle of lead towards enemies and\ndeal damage, but it also pushes Ashe back in the process for a boost of extra\nmobility. Even if you’re alone, it’s still a convenient mode of fluently\nmoving across the map.\n\nDynamite is another devastating tool, acting as a grenade that is ideal for\nclearing characters from a point of payload. It detonates after a brief\nduration, damaging those nearby and setting those in direct line of fire\nalight. It’s easy to hurl and can go quite a distance if you aim it right. But\nonce again, it can feel a bit too effective at times\n\nFinally, you have her ultimate ability – B.O.B. Essentially a robotic butler\nwho grew up with and cared for Ashe, he’s now a force to be reckoned with on\nthe field of battle. The Omnic sidekick will spawn into battle upon activation\nand will knock foes into the air before unloading on them with his arm\ncannons.\n\nAfter enemies are airborne they’re in a perfect position for a shot of your\nrifle, and they’re entirely powerless to stop any attacks that happen to\nconnect. It’s a really neat finishing move, although can take a while to\ncharge, especially for an offensive character encouraged to get into the thick\nof things.\n\n## First Impressions\n\nI like everything about Ashe so far. Her outfit, personality, and repertoire\nof abilities are all cleverly designed and worked wonderfully in the existing\nframework of Overwatch.\n\nAs with all the heroes, there’s still some tuning to be done regarding the\npower of certain abilities and her viability once thrust into public play.\nThat aside, Ashe is yet another excellent addition to Blizzard’s hero shooter.\n\n**Related:[Best PS4 Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nps4-games-3431751)**\n\n![Overwatch\nAshe](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Overwatch Ashe abilities – what does she do?\n\nYou can check out the complete list of her abilities below. It’s worth noting\nthat Ashe’s role is a damage hero.\n\n  * **The Viper** – Ashe’s semi-automatic rifle fires quick shots, or she can use her aim-down sights for a more damaging, precise shot.\n\n  * **Dynamite** – Ashe throws an explosive that detonates after a short delay or immediately when shot. The explosion from Dynamite also lights enemies on fire, dealing damage over time.\n\n  * **Coach Gun** – Ashe blasts enemies in front of her, knocking them away and propelling herself backward for added mobility.\n\n  * **B.O.B.** – Ashe summons her trusted omnic sidekick, B.O.B., who charges forward and knocks enemies into the air, then lays down suppressing fire with his arm cannons.\n\n## Overwatch Ashe Trailer – How does she look?\n\nYou can watch both the latest animated short and Ashe’s gameplay debut below:\n\n**Are you excited to play as Ashe in Overwatch?
