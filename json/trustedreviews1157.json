It\nrepresents a major performance boost over the [Xbox One\nS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/xbox-one-s) and is geared towards\npeople who want to see their games at the best quality possible on console.\n\n4K is the name of the game, and this machine does a sterling job of serving up\ngames at the fabled 3840 x 2160-pixel resolution.\n\n**Related:[More Prime Day Deals ](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/best-\namazon-prime-day-2018-deals-3482743)**\n\nBut it’s not quite that simple. While the number of [Xbox One X\ngames](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/xbox-one-x-games) is increasing by\nthe day, there are still many which won’t offer bespoke advantages on the new\nhardware. In addition, not every game you played on the original Xbox One or\nXbox One S will look better, or even play better, on the One X; it’s entirely\non a game-by-game basis.\n\nAside from muddying the waters, there’s no disputing that the Xbox One X is a\nseriously impressive piece of hardware that takes console performance to new\nheights.\n\nBut does that make it a must-buy?\n\n## **Xbox One X – Design and connectivity**\n\nThe One X is a nice, but not lovely, piece of kit. Smaller in (almost) every\nway than the Xbox One S, it’s practically pint-sized compared to the first\nversion launched in 2013. However, don’t imagine it’ll slot into your media\ncentre like a normal Xbox – instead of an exhaust fan on the top, there’s now\na wide exhaust at the rear of the console.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\n**Related:[Xbox One X vs Xbox One\nS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/xbox-one-x-vs-one-s-2993240)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThis is great for those who want to stack other AV kit on top of the Xbox One\nX, but it does mean you’ll want to give a bit more room around back to\naccommodate the new cooling system.\n\nIn terms of ports, the setup is exactly the same as the Xbox One S, with most\nsitting around the back. Easy peasy. In fact, the only thing that’s changed is\nthe placement of the IR receiver and front-facing USB port, which have swapped\nsides. There’s Wi-Fi, as always, along with a wireless receiver for\ncontrollers as well as a 4K Blu-ray player that functions identically to the\none in the S.\n\nIn terms of build, it’s standard Xbox fare, with a matte black plastic\nhousing. Even after a week of abuse (dropping controllers and power adapters\nonto it and constant HDMI cable swaps and power cable pulls) it looks as\npristine as the day it arrived. I personally prefer the white Xbox One S, but\neach to their own.\n\nIn the box you get the figure-eight power adapter, a HDMI 2.0-certified cable\nand a standard Xbox One controller with non-rechargeable AAA batteries.\n\n### Get a free Xbox One X when you buy any Samsung QLED TV and Soundbar\n\n[](http://clkuk.tradedoubler.com/click?p\\(267868\\)a\\(2961399\\)g\\(22954764\\)url\\(https://www.appliancesdirect.co.uk/bd/samsung-\nbundle-offer\\))\n\n[](http://clkuk.tradedoubler.com/click?p\\(267868\\)a\\(2961399\\)g\\(22954764\\)url\\(https://www.appliancesdirect.co.uk/bd/samsung-\nbundle-offer\\))\n\n###\n\n[Enjoy the ultimate 4K gaming experience\n\n](http://clkuk.tradedoubler.com/click?p\\(267868\\)a\\(2961399\\)g\\(22954764\\)url\\(https://www.appliancesdirect.co.uk/bd/samsung-\nbundle-offer\\))\n\nWith the combination of 4K TV, Soundbar and a free Xbox One X this deal is a\ngamers dream.

But in order to understand what the One X is capable of, we need to\nunderstand what’s under the bonnet. I’ll keep it brief, I promise. But if you\nmust skip ahead, head to [page\ntwo](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/xbox-one-x-performance-4k-gaming)\nof this review where I’ll dive headlong into graphics analysis.\n\n**Related:[E3 2018 latest\nnews](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/e3-2018-games-news-trailers-\nannouncements-2949170)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThere are a fair few elements that contribute to the One X’s improved\nperformance and graphical prowess. The first is simple, and that’s fidelity.\nPrevious Xbox consoles have produced Full HD (1920 x 1080-pixel) images, with\nthe Xbox One S using a technique called ‘upscaling’ to output 4K Ultra HD\n(3840 x 2160-pixel) resolution.\n\nThe One X is different. Instead, it produces Ultra HD images from the off.\nThis means the graphics hardware (GPU) has to work four times as hard to\nproduce each frame – something it has to do up to 60 times every second to\nkeep up with a TV. The expected result? A much, much sharper image that makes\nproper use of all those pixels in your fancy [4K\nTV](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-4k-tvs).\n\nThat’d be impressive enough, but in order to make those super-sharp images\nlook the bee’s knees, the Xbox has to work even harder. It’s no use having a\nsuper-sharp image if it looks a bit naff elsewhere. That’s where the second\nupgrade comes in, and that’s what I like to call graphical eye-candy. Eye-\ncandy is the sort of stuff you’ll notice when playing an immersive story-\ndriven game like [Gears of War\n4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/gears-of-war-4) or [Rise of the Tomb\nRaider](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/rise-of-the-tomb-raider).\nYou’ll see light rays filtering through trees, shadows that more accurately\nreflect what’s going on in the world, higher-quality reflections, the ability\nto see further and in more detail, and much more.\n\n**Related:[Best Xbox One Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nxbox-one-games)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSome games will even support wide colour gamut HDR, which means you’ll see\nmore and brighter colours than ever before. Some games on the Xbox One S\nalready supported this, but in conjunction with Ultra HD and the other\ngraphical enhancements, it should look more spectacular here than ever before.\n\nBut it’s not as simple as firing up your favourite game and enjoying the new\ngraphics. Each developer for every game has to go out of its way to update a\ngame in order for it to take advantage of the One X’s new hardware. Look out\nfor the ‘One X Enhanced’ label on game marketing to see whether the title\nyou’re most excited about will look any better.\n\n**Buy the Xbox One X\nfrom[Tesco](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7090&awinaffid=277673&clickref=tr-\ntescocampaign&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tesco.com%2Fdirect%2Fxbox-one-x-1tb-with-\nfar-cry-5-console-bundle%2F267-9173.prd%3FskuId%3D267-9173)|\n[Amazon.com](http://amzn.to/2GOy2C4)**\n\nAll of this is possible because the One X is, according to Microsoft, almost\nfour times more powerful than the Xbox One S. There’s an eight-core AMD\nprocessor running at 2.3GHz, and a much-improved AMD graphics chip with 40\nCompute Units (versus 12 on the older models). There’s 12GB of high-speed\nmemory for the console to use, with around 9GB set aside for games and\ngraphics. The whole lot is cooled by a vapour chamber that channels heat to\nthe rear of the console via a state-changing liquid/gas copper heat pipe, to\nbe deposited in a heatsink and cooled by fans. This is why the One X is able\nto be so powerful, yet so small. That, and a load of electrical wizardry that\nmakes each individual component substantially more efficient. This is a little\nbox of big tricks.\n\nSpeaking of little boxes, the 1TB hard disk is laughably small in an age where\n4K games weigh in at over 100GB. You’re going to want to invest in an external\nUSB hard disk if you don’t want to have to keep deleting games to make space\nfor others. Fortunately, Xbox One consoles do at least let you run games from\nan external disk, so you don’t have to worry about moving them back and forth.\n\nNow, let’s take a look at the performance of the machine.\n\n[ Next  \nPerformance and 4K gaming ](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/xbox-one-x-\nperformance-4k-gaming)\n\n"}
