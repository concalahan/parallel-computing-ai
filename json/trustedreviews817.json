Its photosgenerally have a more true-to-life look in terms of white balance and colour,and it’s also definitely the best for video.But overall I’d say the [Google Pixel3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-3) is the slightlybetter all-rounder for still photos. In even light and low light, it justshoots brighter, crisper and more detailed photos. Its low light performanceis already pretty incredible, and there’s still its promising Night Sight modeto come.You could argue that those who prefer more ‘camera-like’ photos will favourthe iPhone’s slightly more restrained processing.

And for that, the Pixel 3 has theedge.**What do you think, did you prefer the Pixel 3 photos or the iPhone XS snapsin our tests? Drop us a line @TrustedReviews on Twitter.**"}
