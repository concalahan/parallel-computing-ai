Having cut its teeth with superhero\nopen-world experiences, Sucker Punch is now delving into the lands of Feudal\nJapan. Having seen it in the flesh at E3 2018, we’re very eager to see more of\nGhosts of Tsushima and how it takes advantage of\n[PS4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/playstation-4).\n\n_Trusted Reviews_ has compiled everything you need to know about Ghosts of\nTsushima including all the latest news, release date, trailers and our preview\nfrom E3 2018.\n\n## Ghost of Tsushima release date – when is it coming out?\n\nIn development exclusively for PS4, Sony is yet to confirm a release date or\nwindow for Ghosts of Tsushima. Here’s hoping we hear more at PlayStation\nExperience later this year.\n\n## Ghost of Tsushima – What is it?\n\nSet in the province of Tsushima, Japan. You play as a samurai, exploring an\nopen world and engaging in missions. From an extended look at Ghost of\nTsushima at Sony’s E3 2018 press conference, it seems that stealth will to\nplay a substantial part in the game, as will some frankly brutal melee combat.\n\nA tense one-on-one duel was also featured, which appeared to rely on you not\nflinching until the exact moment it’s time to strike. It was this one-on-one\nfight that gave us our best look at the title’s combat, which seems to place a\nheavy emphasis on parrying your enemies attacks.\n\n**Related:[Xbox One X vs PS4 Pro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/xbox-\none-x-vs-ps4-pro-2993235)**\n\n![ghosts of\ntsushima](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n###  Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\n## Ghost of Tsushima release date – When’s it out?\n\nSucker Punch hasn’t revealed any sort of release date information during\neither of the game’s trailer, not even a vague year, which suggests this is\nstill a significant way’s away from launch.\n\n## Ghost of Tsushima Gameplay Preview\n\nThe Ghost of Tsushima trailer shown during Sony’s [E3\n2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/e3-2018-2949170) press conference\ncame immediately after [The Last of Us Part\n2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/last-of-us-2-release-date-gameplay-\ntrailer-pre-order-news-wishlist-2944236), a tough act to follow for anyone. It\nalso left many viewers with more questions than answers despite its utterly\nstunning showcase\n\nSeeing the team behind InFamous’ vision of feudal Japan, which is a stunning\nhuge open world and how Jin, our lead character, fits within it, was a nice\nfirst-look. But it wasn’t until a behind closed doors session with Sucker\nPunch co-founder, Chris Zimmerman, that I got any idea how the game will play,\nand an opening glimpse at the incredibly exciting story that lies in wait.\n\nThe game’s vision of feudal Japan is not hamstrung by history. Zimmerman notes\nduring the presentation that the team is not allowing themselves to be slaves\nto history – the devs are taking artistic license when it comes to historical\naccuracy. How this will shape up in the finished appearance remains unclear.\n\n**Related:[Marvel’s Spider-Man\nReview](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/spider-man-ps4)**\n\n![ghosts of\ntsushima](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nTherefore, the story that unfolds becomes inherently more interesting. You\nplay as Jin, a man raised in the art of Samurai who must defend his island\nfrom a Mongolian invasion. However, all of Jin’s masters have been slain\nduring the conflict, thanks to the Mongolians not conforming to the rules of\nSamurai, leading Jin to question everything he has been taught.\n\nThis answered a big question that I had about the game. Being an open-world\nexperience in which we played a samurai, I feared for the progression system.\nSucker Punch has always delivered excellent leveling mechanics and a well-\npaced unlocking of new abilities, but I couldn’t envision how a samurai could\nunlock a new outfit or special powers. Zimemrman answers this through the\nstory: Jin must adapt and make the decision to abandon his teachings in order\nto beat the Mongolians, and in that lies how the game will allow new weapons\nand techniques to be unlocked.\n\nHe does point out, however, that players can choose to play through the\nexperience as a samurai, but during the post-demo Q&A notes this will not be a\nDark Souls-style experience where players can end the game how they started\nwithout any form of leveling up.\n\nWe then come to the first fight in the trailer, this time being played in real\ntime. Jin’s ‘Jutsu’, the samurai art of a strike delivered as the sword is\ndrawn, is a skill that is earned in the game, and is shown once again.\nZimmerman notes that skills such as these have the potential to intimidate\nother enemies in the encounter, and the two other Mongolians noticeably step\nback in fear as the strike lands. Zimmerman also says that every single\ndroplet of blood that spatters after the strike is tracked in real time.\n\nEach fight will reportedly be a stiff challenge as Sucker Punch wants every\nencounter to feel worthwhile and meaningful. Your success in fights comes down\nto timing blocks, countering and strikes. Watching the sword fight happen in\nreal time, the game looked thrilling.\n\n**Related:[Hitman 2 release date, preview and\nmore](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/hitman-2-release-date-gameplay-\nnews-3483175)**\n\n![ghosts of\ntsushima](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nI did have concerns about the camera, though. Watching the developer\ncontrolling the demo it looks like the camera is manually controlled by the\nplayer, and attacks are done using the face buttons, which could prove fiddly\nduring heated exchanges – though Zimmerman promised the camera controls won’t\nunfairly punish the player. Time will tell whether or not this will be the\ncase.\n\nWhen Jin approaches the house to rescue the monk, Zimmerman confirms that\nplayers can approach this mission in multiple ways. If you like, you could\nenter via the front door and challenge all the Mongolians inside to a fight,\nor you could opt for a stealthy approach and enter quietly through the roof.\n\nBut the most interesting thing about this demo is the almost Darwinian\napproach to the story. Jin’s need to abandon his teachings in order to not\nonly save himself but also his land will be fascinating to see unfold, both\nfrom a narrative and gameplay perspective. Seeing how it plays into the game’s\nRPG-esque mechanics of unlocking new weapons and abilities will be very\ninteresting in this historical setting, particularly from a studio that’s best\nknown for creating gorgeous worlds that focus on a supernatural lead.\n\nIt gives Ghost of Tsushima so much more potential than I thought it had, and\ncertainly, this presentation sold it in a far better light than its E3 trailer\ndid, because of how much more room to breath it’s been given.\n\n## Ghost of Tsushima First Impressions\n\nWith Ghost of Tsushima immediately following that frankly astounding Last of\nUs Part 2 trailer during Sony’s conference, I was initially underwhelmed.\nGetting a second stab at it, and having the team at Sucker Punch guide me\nthrough the concept at a much greater level of detail, I’m now far more\ninterested in what this game could become.\n\n**Related:[Cyberpunk\n2077](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/cyberpunk-2077-release-date-\ngameplay-2948412)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Ghost of Tsushima Trailer – How’s it look?\n\nOur most recent look at the game came at E3 2018 when Sony showed off a\nlengthy gameplay trailer for the upcoming game.\n\nYou can watch this trailer below.\n\n## Ghost of Tsushima Story – What’s it about?\n\nWhile the trailers have revealed little in the way of detail, the description\nof the video revealed plenty more about the game:\n\n“The year is 1274. Samurai warriors are the legendary defenders of Japan–until\nthe fearsome Mongol Empire invades the island of Tsushima, wreaking havoc and\nconquering the local population. As one of the last surviving samurai, you\nrise from the ashes to fight back. But, honorable tactics won’t lead you to\nvictory. You must move beyond your samurai traditions to forge a new way of\nfighting–the way of the Ghost–as you wage an unconventional war for the\nfreedom of Japan.”\n\n**Related:[Upcoming PS4 Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/upcoming-\nps4-games)**\n\n![ghosts of tsushima\n](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nThere’s no doubt we’ll find out much more about the story and its lead\ncharacters as we get closer to launch.\n\n**Are you as excited for Ghost of Tsushima as we are?
