And, to nobody’s surprise, it’s\nabsolutely gorgeous.\n\nPenned by Tetsuya Nomura, it features all of the main characters staring out\nto the horizon while perched on a rooftop.

Sora, Donald and Goofy, on the other hand, are busy in pursuit of\nthe Seven Guardians of Light across myriad different worlds. All of this is\nbeing done in a passionate attempt to stop Master Xehanort’s evil plan first\nalluded to in previous games.\n\nGame director Tetsuya Nomura has confirmed that Kingdom Hearts 3 will begin\nimmediately after the ending of Dream Drop Distance, acting as the penultimate\nchapter in the Dark Seeker Saga. We’d be here all day if we tried to decipher\nthe entire Kingdom Hearts timeline. There have been so many spinoffs, sequels,\nand side projects at this point it can be difficult to determine where exactly\nKingdom Hearts 3 lies in the bigger picture.\n\n**Related:[Best RPGs](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-rpg)**\n\n![Kingdom Hearts 3\n](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\n## Kingdom Hearts 3 release date – When is it coming out?\n\nKingdom Hearts 3 is set to launch on January 29, 2019, for\n[PS4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/ps4-pro) and [Xbox\nOne!](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/xbox-one-s)\n\nThere will be standard and special editions of the game launching alongside\none another, something such a widely anticipated release has very much earned.\n\n> KINGDOM HEARTS III will be releasing on Xbox One and Playstation 4 on\nJanuary 29, 2019!\n[#KingdomHearts](https://twitter.com/hashtag/KingdomHearts?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n[#KH3](https://twitter.com/hashtag/KH3?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n[pic.twitter.com/vpcpxbkreX](https://t.co/vpcpxbkreX)\n\n>\n\n> — Kingdom Hearts (@KINGDOMHEARTS) [June 10,\n2018](https://twitter.com/KINGDOMHEARTS/status/1005683145990025216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n## Kingdom Hearts 3 Gameplay Preview – How does it play?\n\nAlthough Kingdom Hearts 3 is absolutely a role-playing game, it often feels\nmuch closer to an action game to actually play, as we found out when we spent\nsome time with it on the show floor at E3 2018. We got to try out portions of\ntwo levels from the game, one based around the characters from Toy Story, and\na second set in the world of Disney’s Hercules.\n\nToy Story’s ‘Toy Box’ level gave us a chance to get acquainted with a typical\ncombat encounter in the game. You’ll spend most of your time using your\nstandard attack against enemies, while every so often using your various\nspecial attacks to clear out larger numbers of them at a time.\n\nEach of these special attacks is themed around the different universes\nfeatured in Kingdom Hearts. During our time with the game, we saw a spinning\nteacup attack and a swinging boat themed around famous Disney World\nattractions. Other special attacks were gained by attacking enemies with a\ngreen target sign over them, unlocking alternative special attacks such as\nthrowing the character Goofy at them or bringing in Ralph from Wreck-It Ralph\nto take out vast numbers of enemies at a time.\n\n**Related:[Death Stranding](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/death-\nstranding-release-date-2947317) **\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAdditionally, you can also switch between different keyblades mid-battle with\na quick tap of the D-pad, each of which will then level up to unlock more\npowerful moves with each successive hit This will play a big part in deeper\ncombat in the finished product.\n\nThere’s a lot of different systems to keep track of in Kingdom Hearts 3.\nThankfully, it’s fun just to bound around hitting enemies with your standard\nattack, and you’re going to need to pay close attention to the menu on the\nbottom left of the screen if you want to get tackle the toughest battles.\nHere’s hoping for a secret boss or two!\n\nThis menu is always active in Kingdom Hearts 3, and you can move around it\nusing the D-pad to access special abilities like spells from the Final Fantasy\nseries (think ‘Curaga’ and ‘Firaga’ for example). It’s possible to spend ages\ntinkering around in these menus, but thankfully you can access shortcuts with\nthe left bumper in order to save some time when you’re in a sticky situation.\n\nThe whole game looks phenomenal, and the Toy Story segment, in particular,\nmanages to surpass the CG masterpieces that inspired them with bright, fluid\nanimations and gorgeous cutscenes.\n\n**Related:[The Division 2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/the-\ndivision-2-release-date-gameplay-3415602) **\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIt also helps that the world is an exceptionally faithful recreation of the\nsetting from the movie, with the whole world structured exactly as we\nremembered from the movie itself. Those looking for a nostalgic goldmine\nshould look no further than Kingdom Hearts 3.\n\nThe faithfulness of this recreation dropped off a little bit as we moved into\nthe second half of the Toy Story segment, where we infiltrated a toy shop in\norder to save a member of our team and faced off against a team of giant (toy)\nrobots.\n\nThankfully, this decline was offset by some more interesting gameplay ideas,\nwhere we were able to pilot these robots as though we were piloting a mech in\nTitan fall. We shot our way through the rest of the enemies in the level,\noccasionally hopping out of our improvised mech to take out the smaller,\nnimbler enemies on foot.\n\nSoon it was time for us to move over to the Hercules-themed level ‘Olympus’.\nThe unique thing about this level was its boss fight, which played like a\nheavily simplified level from Shadow of the Colossus.\n\n**Related:[Super Smash Bros\nUltimate](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/super-smash-bros-ultimate-\nnintendo-switch-release-date-gameplay-2949964)**\n\n![Kingdom Hearts\n3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nRather than painstakingly climbing up each of the arms of our gigantic foe,\nhowever, Kingdom Hearts 3 simply had us point ourselves at a wall, and run\ntowards it to automatically ascend up to the boss at the top of the mountain.\n\nAlthough the fight was fairly simple, there were enough different elements at\nplay to keep it interesting as we avoided enemy attacks, held our special\nattacks in reserve until the best possible moment, and eventually found\nourselves in an on-rails shooting segment to finish off the boss.\n\nBecause Hercules was a 2D animated movie rather than a CG title, it wasn’t as\npossible for its representation in Kingdom Hearts to be quite as authentic\nwith it as it was the Toy Story segment, but nevertheless, it felt close to\nthe look and feel of the original movie.\n\n## First impressions\n\nIt’s difficult to tell from a demo where you always have the sneaking\nsuspicion that the difficulty might be set to ‘easy’, but we hope that the\nfinal game is challenging enough to force players to use all the gameplay\nsystems available.\n\nIt felt like there was so much depth in the build that we played, but it was\nall too easy to tackle all our enemies by repeatedly spamming our standard\nattacks.\n\nBut the game was infinitely more fun when we started to experiment with the\nadvanced move sets, and we hope the final release makes these feel necessary\nrather than optional.\n\n**See also:[Upcoming PS4 Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/upcoming-\nps4-games_round-up)**\n\n![Kingdom Hearts\n3](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\n## Kingdom Hearts 3 Worlds – What’s been confirmed?\n\nKingdom Hearts 3 will introduce a number of original locations alongside a\nslew of Disney-themed locales. Tangled and Big Hero 6 are two of the\nproperties confirmed thus far, with favourites based on Hercules already\nscheduled to return in the sequel. Since the release of Kingdom Hearts 2,\nDisney has acquired Marvel, Lucasfilm, and Pixar. Unfortunately, many of these\nwon’t appear in KH3 due to existing licensing deals, such as the agreement\nconcerning Electronic Arts and Star Wars.\n\nTo make things easier, we’ve compiled a list of confirmed worlds below:\n\n  * Kingdom of Corona (Tangled)\n  * Big Hero 6\n  * Mount Olympus\n  * Twilight Town\n  * Monster’s Inc\n  * Mysterious Tower\n  * Tangled\n  * Toy Story (featuring Wreck it Ralph)\n  * Frozen\n  * Pirates of the Caribbean\n\nNow that the game has been announced for years, there have been a number of\ndifferent trailers that have introduced new characters and locations.
