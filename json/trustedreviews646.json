It’s essentially Indiana Jones in gaming form and isn’t tryingto be anything more than that. Uncharted 5 should continue this streak with anall-new narrative and cast to work with. Lightning doesn’t strike twice, butwe’re sure Naughty Dog is capable of capturing the same sense of playful magiconce again.## Improved multiplayerUncharted 4’s multiplayer was a surprisingly solid affair and continues to besupported to this day with new maps, modes and skins for players to enjoy.Naughty Dog should try its very best to continue this trend while expandingits online offerings. By translating the mixture of gunplay and traversal to amultiplayer arena, A Thief’s End kept things fresh without losing what we loveabout Nathan Drake’s solo escapades. Of course, it could always be improved.We’d love to see co-operative campaigns from past titles make a return.Working together with your friends toward a common goal was an absolutethrill.**_Do you want to see Uncharted 5?
