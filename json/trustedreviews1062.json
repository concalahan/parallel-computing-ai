We are very excited to be partnering\nwith Starship as it brings regular deliveries by robot one step closer to\ncommercial operations,” Domino’s Group CEO and Managing Director Don Meij\nsaid.\n\nGermany and the Netherlands will be the first countries to greet the robots,\nwhich will be able to trundle along to customer addresses within a one mile\nradius of stores.\n\n**Related:[Galaxy S8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-\ngalaxy-s8-review)**\n\n![Dominos Pizza Robot\n2](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\nMeij went on to explain there are simply not enough delivery drivers to cope\nwith the anticipated demand for pizzas over the next decade and the robots\nwill fill the void.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nPlans for a UK debut for the robots are yet to be finalised and there are\nplenty of questions that we have ahead of them arriving.\n\nFor example, what if the pizza turns up cold or an item is forgotten? Do we\ntip? And, will the robot have a bottle of coke stowed away like the driver\nsometimes does for when we forget to order it?\n\nStarship also has deals in place with plenty of other companies such as Just\nEat and Hermes, and the UK will almost certainly be one of the next places\nthat the Domino’s robots deliver.\n\n**Watch: Amazon Echo vs Google Home**\n\n**Would you rather a robot delivers your pizza?
