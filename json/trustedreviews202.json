They’re not quite as good as the [Pixel2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-2), but this is onearea you will notice if you decide to upgrade.The iPhone 8 Plus has a new Portrait Lighting mode that’ll launch in beta, andthis adds a so-called ‘professional lighting’ look to your pictures.When we reviewed the iPhone 7 our biggest criticism was the poor battery life.We struggled to make it past the end of the working day without reaching forthe Lightning cable. The 7 Plus didn’t have the same problems, thankfully.The battery on the iPhone 8 is actually smaller than the 7, but optimisationsfor the new CPU does make it last longer. We’ve managed to get about daywithout reaching for the charger.### Trusted Reviews Exclusive iPhone XS Deal[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-iPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-space-grey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)[](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-iPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-space-grey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)###[Apple iPhone XS – 10GB, £40pm with £350 upfront on O2](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-iPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-space-grey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)Giving you plenty of data for the low price of just £40 a month, this monthlycontract with O2 is an incredible deal that can't be missed if you want to beone of the first people to own an iPhone XS.[Mobiles.co.uk](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-iPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-space-grey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)|£350 upfront|£40/month[ViewDeal](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-iPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-space-grey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)£40/month|£350 upfront|[Mobiles.co.uk](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=TR-iPhoneXSExclusive&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fapple-iphone-xs-64gb-space-grey%3Ftariffcode%3DFD4ZMMAR18%26affiliate%3Dawinm-277673%26awc%3D380_1536927063_601e77eecee203e8a7db9a6be67e190e%26utm_source%3DAwin%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.cyclingweekly.co.uk%252F)## **iPhone 7 vs iPhone 8 Price: Which phone offers better value for money?**When it first went on sale in late 2016, the iPhone 7 started off at £599 for32GB of storage and £699 for 128GB.
