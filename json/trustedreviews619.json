Despite a cliffhanger ending, many fans – ourselves\nincluded – had given up hope of ever seeing a second season from Bigby Wolf.\n\nWhile still some way off, _TrustedReviews_ has compiled everything you need to\nknow about The Wolf Among Us Season 2, including its release date, gameplay,\ntrailers, story and more.\n\n## What is The Wolf Among Us Season 2?\n\nOnce again starring grumpy detective Bigby Wolf as the main protagonist, this\nrun of episodes will embark on an all-new narrative, never touching upon the\nfirst season finale’s intriguing twist. This may disappoint some fans, but\nwe’re excited to see where Telltale hopes to take such a strange and ambitious\nworld with several new episodes.\n\n**Related:[The Walking Dead Season 3\nreview](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=the+walking+dead+season+3+trusted&oq=the+walking+dead+season+3+trusted&aqs=chrome..69i57.4190j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## The Wolf Among Us Season 2 release date\n\nAnnounced during San Diego Comic Con alongside new seasons of Batman and The\nWalking Dead, The Wolf Among Us Season 2 will debut in late 2018.\n\nTelltale Games is yet to announce specific platforms, but\n[PS4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/playstation-4), [Xbox\nOne](https://www.trustedreviews.com/xbox-one-review) and\n[PC](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/best-gaming-pc-2993099) are very\nlikely inclusions.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Spintires: Mudrunners – American Wilds Edition\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/spintires-mudrunners-american-wilds-\nedition \"Spintires: Mudrunners – American Wilds Edition\")\n\n  * [ ![Galaxy Note 10](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Best Phone 2018: 10 best smartphones revealed and rated\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-smartphone-3431175 \"Best Phone\n2018: 10 best smartphones revealed and rated\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Wooting One Keyboard](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Wooting One\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/wooting-one \"Wooting One\")\n\n  * \n\n## The Wolf Among Us Season 2 story\n\nThe second season will tell a new “standalone story” away from the first\nseason’s events. As mentioned before, the cliffhanger ending from the first\nseason will not be resolved, despite fans having waited three years for\nclosure. Adam Harrington and Erin Yvette return as Bigby Wolf and Snow White\nrespectively, so expect a familiar type of banter between characters.\n\n**Related:[Xbox One X vs PS4 Pro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/xbox-\none-x-vs-ps4-pro-2993235)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## The Wolf Among Us Season 2 gameplay\n\nWe haven’t seen any gameplay as yet, but the Telltale formula is one that\nremains predictable with each new outing. You often play as one or several\ndifferent characters across a branching, episodic narrative. Your decisions\nare likely to have a major impact on how the game unfolds, with many testing\nyour moral compass as well as determining who lives or dies.\n\nTelltale Games could always surprise us with a new addition to its gameplay\nformula, or perhaps build upon the hectic combat sequences found in past\nepisodes. Bigby Wolf is a force to be reckoned with, and we’d love to exercise\ngreater control over such physical power. Perhaps we’ll see the addition of\nnew playable characters, too.\n\n## The Wolf Among Us Season 2 trailers\n\nYou can find the announcement trailer below:\n\nIt doesn’t provide us with any gameplay or story details, but instead features\nthe voice actors teasing fans about something they’ve been waiting years for.\nIt’s coming in 2018, and you can count us in.\n\n"}
