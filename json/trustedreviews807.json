At this point we have maybe over six heroes in planning, so we’re\npretty far out at this point so there’s a lot more coming. There’s a crazy\ncast coming and a lot more diversity in body types as well.”\n\n**Related:**[ **Diablo Immortal**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/diablo-\nimmortal-release-date-3614896)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThey weren’t able to share any specifics with us, and also didn’t confirm\nwhether Echo, a robotic character featured in a recent animated short, will be\nthe next hero to come after Ashe’s release. But she is coming as a playable\ncharacter, that much is clear.\n\nAs to where the inspiration for these more diverse characters will come from,\nprincipal designer Scott Mercer cites “other games, films, anime” and the\nteam’s passion for travel for igniting the flames of creativity.\n\n“It’s something we really enjoy doing and I think it’s one of the things that\nmakes Overwatch special, just how diverse it is in characters, maps, languages\nand everything. It’s a joy to work on.”\n\nAshe has a fantastic design and a personality to match, although it’s somewhat\npredictable in the design tropes it adopts. As to how she plays, we had a\nblast:\n\n‘I like everything about Ashe so far. Her outfit, personality, and repertoire\nof abilities are all cleverly designed and worked wonderfully in the existing\nframework of Overwatch.\n\nAs with all the heroes, there’s still some tuning to be done regarding the\npower of certain abilities and her viability once thrust into public play.\nThat aside, Ashe is yet another excellent addition to Blizzard’s hero\nshooter.’\n\n**Related:[Best Xbox One Games ](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/xbox-one-\ngames-3435271)**\n\n![Overwatch\nAshe](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nOverwatch has received applause for its inclusivity ever since it was first\nreleased in 2016, with a cast of characters from several backgrounds. In\nshorts and comics, it’s noted that Symmetra is autistic and Tracer is a\nlesbian, however many of these details come from external sources, instead of\nmaking an actual appearance inside the game.\n\nIn addition to this, it seems Blizzard has a problem with designing their\nfemale characters, as many of them are lithe women that adhere to conventional\nattractiveness standards. Ashe continues this trend, leading to several people\ntaking to Twitter and Reddit to claim that Blizzard can and should be taking\nmore chances with the female characters in their game.\n\nHowever, Blizzard doesn’t want lore to interfere too heavily with the game’s\nstatus as a competitive shooter, “It’s difficult for us to do a lot of stuff\nin-game because it’s a team-based shooter and you’re shooting each other.”\n\n“The issue is really that we want to tell all the stories. We have all this\ncool information and we wanna get it out there, but we don’t want to be like,\nhere’s a cinematic after you start every match and you’ve gotta watch this\nthing. Eventually, you’ll be like, well now I don’t like the lore because it’s\nin my way.\n\n“It’s always trying to strike a balance and we want gameplay to be the core.\nIt’s a Blizzard philosophy, one of our values is to put gameplay first and\nkeep that in the highest regard. We do a lot with the maps if we can, and\nsometimes it’s kinda cool to have stuff in there that players can find out as\na little easter egg.”\n\n**Do you want to see more diversity in Overwatch?
