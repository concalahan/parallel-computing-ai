Well, we\ngot the real deal this weekend – and true enough, the sequel to [2016’s\nDoom](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/doom) looks fantastic.**\n\nDoom Eternal builds upon the frenetic combat of its predecessor, while\nintroducing new worlds, fresh weapons, speedier movement systems and a\n‘meathook’. The latter is a kind of grappling hook you can fire into demons to\nuse them as anchors. Yes, really. That might not sound like classic Doom, but\nwhen you see it all in action, Doom Eternal absolutely echoes the gleefully\nspeedy shooting of the early FPS glory days. Online players will also have the\nability to take the role of demons and ‘invade’ another player’s campaign.\n\nFollowing the big QuakeCon demos, we had a chance to speak with game director\nMarty Stratton and creative director Hugo Martin about the myriad additions\nand evolutions, the ‘invasion’ multiplayer system, why they see Doom as a\ncartoon, and how Doom Eternal is this team’s Evil Dead II.\n\n**Related:[Best FPS Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/fps-\ngames-3526310)**\n\n![doom eternal\n](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\n**Trusted Reviews:** _Following 2016’s Doom, what did you want to do to take\nDoom Eternal even more over the top?_\n\n**Marty Stratton:** Making the Slayer an even bigger badass is probably first\nand foremost. There are always a lot of things that you want to address. Just\ntake the experience to the next level and reinforce the power fantasy,\ncertainly. Bring people a bit more into the lore, make it a little bit more\naccessible. Let them know that when we’re creating a Doom universe, there is a\nlot behind everything that you do.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nAnother big thing was to take the Doom ‘dance’ that people love to play and\nmake it a social one, which is where we’re diving into the invasion stuff and\nthe way we’re approaching PvP as well. Those were some of the high-level\nguiding principles coming out of 2016.\n\n**Trusted Reviews** : _Were there some ideas that you had for the 2016 game\nthat you couldn’t realise then that we’re now seeing come to life here?_\n\n**Hugo Martin** : Oh yeah. In general, there was so much going on at the\nstudio at the time. It’s well-documented, with reboots, and we restaffed a\nlarge amount of the team. Now we’re just in a position where the team, having\nshipped a game together, is firing on all cylinders. Everybody’s working\ntogether in a really fantastic way.\n\nWhat that adds up to is that we’re able to do better work faster, so we can\njust put more into the game on a day-to-day basis, and pack it with as much\ncool stuff as we can. That’s been the most exciting part about everything –\nbeing able to do it this time fully powered.\n\n**Trusted Reviews** : _Can you talk about the ‘meathook’ and the added\nmovement options, and how that impacts the experience?_\n\n**Stratton:** Those types of things like the meathook and the dash are a way\nthat you can make the Slayer more aggressive. When we’re enhancing the power\nfantasy or enhancing the game, how do we make him more powerful and a more\nlethal killer of demons? [With] something like the dash or the meathook –\npeople have called it the grappling hook, but it is just a grapple to demons.\n\nIf you’re going to use that capability, we want you to use it to get closer to\na demon. We put it on the Super Shotgun because you’re pulling yourself close\nin to use a close-range weapon in most cases (although you can switch away).\nAnd it’s to enhance the acrobatic nature of the game as a whole.\n\nAll of these components, whether it’s the meathook, the dash, the wall climb\nor the monkey bars, as we call them, they’re all tools you can combine to\nchoreograph your own fight scene. They’re all very complimentary and trying to\nwork together to make him even more of a badass.\n\n**Related:[Best PS4\nGames](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/ps4-games-3431751)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Trusted Reviews:** _Doom Eternal goes to some new places that we haven’t\nseen before, and you talked about expanding the lore. What’s that process of\nexpanding upon the core Doom experience and finding new places to take it?_\n\n**Martin:** We started in 2016, and all of it is just meant to enhance the\ngameplay. We don’t want Doom to become a story-driven game, certainly. Our\ncore mantra is to kill amazing bad guys in super-cool places with really\nawesome weapons. We’re trying to build a fantastic universe to be able to pull\nthat off.\n\nIt’s a continuation of what started in Doom 2016. A lot of fans who dug into\nthe lore are very excited to get some answers to their questions. Doom 2016\nintroduced a lot of concepts to fans about the Doom Slayer, the hero of the\ngame. It also opened up a lot of questions and hinted at things. We really\nwant to provide those answers to players in Doom Eternal – and maybe pose a\nfew more [questions]. But we’re very excited for what the fans are going to\nsee there, and you got a little taste of it in the concept art and the\nlocations that we saw [at QuakeCon].\n\nFor us, it just means: “Play it, don’t say it.” We’ll certainly have plenty of\nlore in the game with codex entries, and that will be enhanced too. “But I\nread about these epic adventures or heard about them in the Slayer’s\nTestament. Can I go to that place? Can I fight that guy?” Yes, you can.\n\n**Stratton:** I think it’s important for players to understand, we get so\nexcited about things that are in the game, whether it’s the design of a weapon\nor the design of the Crucible, because we know the story behind them. It’s\nalmost like trying to transfer some of that excitement and that history – or\nthe excitement of the history – to the fans.\n\nWe very much look at [developing] the Slayer as us trying to create a\nsuperhero. When you look at other superheroes, whether it’s Batman or Iron\nMan, they have this really cool, unique, compelling backstory of Bruce Wayne\nor Tony Stark, that really enhances who they are as a superhero.\n\nFor us, [it was about] bringing the fans in on that conversation a little bit\nand bringing that a little more to the forefront – but certainly not making\nthe game about it by any stretch. It’s still all about what he does – “Play\nit, don’t say it” – but playing it is the way that people are going to access\nour lore. And when they look around and they’re like: “Holy shit, now I\nunderstand,” it’s pretty exciting.\n\n**Martin:** Especially in first-person shooters, that’s the thing that we’re\nmost excited about. We want to embrace the medium of games, and not take the\nconventions of film and mash them into a video-game experience. We give you\nthe lore, we take you to these places, we do some of the things, we read about\nothers. And you just learn all of this context about yourself: “I’m this epic,\nlegendary badass.” And in a first-person shooter? How great is it that I’m\ngoing to let you see it through his eyes?\n\nWhen you walk through that hallway in Mars Core, and those guys’ reaction to\nyou? That’s because you, the player – you spent a little time, you read a\nlittle lore, you went on the adventure of 2016, and you know all this stuff\nabout yourself. That makes it so much more impactful, embracing what a first-\nperson shooter can excel at when it comes to narrative. And that’s the thing\nthat only video games can do, and only a shooter can do. You’re not going to\njust watch him from a third-person camera, you’re gonna be in his head. A\nride-along, if you like.\n\nAnd the best part is, it’s consistent with the way you want to play Doom. You\nplay Doom because you want to play like a badass. That’s been there since\n1993. The story supports that. There’s no disconnect between the lore, the\nuniverse, the things I’m doing, the places I’m going, and how I want to play\nthe game.\n\nIt’s a joke to call it cinematic since it’s a walk down a hallway. But it’s\nnot that in that cinematic, I behave in a way that’s different to the way I\nbehave when I get to the bottom and I start destroying the world. No, who I\nwas in the hallway is exactly who I am when I’m destroying the demons. That’s\nsuper, super important to us.\n\n**Related:[Best Xbox One Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-xbox-\none-games-3435271)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Trusted Reviews:** _How did you revisit more of the classic enemies and\nmodernise them for this new era?_\n\n**Stratton:** We did a lot of it for 2016. First of all, the Doom enemies are\nfantastic – going all the way back to those original designs, the characters\nand personalities of them. Just how over-the-top they are is inspiring for us.\nWe get to walk around the halls at id and see the original statues that they\nhad made to build around or to scan.\n\nAnd it’s fun. We want to embrace that – but as you said – we always modernize\nit and find a new twist to it. It’s really about bringing that personality\nthat was there, but with all of the modern animation techniques and technology\nand texturing and rendering, bringing them to life in a new way.\n\nThen, of course, there’s the whole way we’re approaching gore and the whole\nfeedback side of it. We want it to feel amazing when you shoot your gun and\nhit them with a bullet. The way we’ve brought glory kills into it – taking\nthat personality that they have and infusing it into all of that. When you\nwatch the glory kills back in slow motion and you see their eyes like [makes\nexaggerated eye-bulging motion], it’s cool because it’s that 1993-94\npersonality brought to life in using all-new techniques, all-new technology,\nand really, really creative minds.\n\n**Martin:** This is our Evil Dead II. That’s how I think of it. When you look\nat [Sam Raimi’s 1981] Evil Dead, all of that stuff that he just said, you\ncould apply to that game. Doom 2016: amazing, awesome game. Evil Dead:\namazing, awesome movie. Didn’t have the resources maybe, or just wasn’t there\nyet to be able to truly pull off what he did in Evil Dead II, and that’s what\nwe have now.\n\nThe team is humming, the tech is there, and we’re ready to go, firing on all\ncylinders. Characters look better, they perform better, and they feel better\nwhen you shoot them. I think the goal is that it looks like a AAA version of\nthe 1993 Doom. That’s what I’m so proud of with that footage. If you were to\nmodernise Doom in a AAA game from 1993, that’s what it would look like.\n\nThere are a lot of little things that we do to pull that off. I know some fans\nwho love certain aspects of Doom 3, and totally, I do too. This is a cartoon.\nThis is supposed to be fun. That’s what Doom was in 1993, so we take a lot of\nthe dark shadows out of the world. We bring up the fill light. It kind of\nflattens the world a little bit, but it creates all of this visual detail and\nit does give it this cartoonish effect, which ultimately kind of balances out\nthe ridiculous amount of violence in the game.\n\nThe gore is handled in a cartoonish way, which is totally consistent with the\noriginal Doom games. And if it wasn’t done that way, you’re blowing off all of\nthis flesh on this guy’s arm and he’s coming at you. We’ve had internal devs\ncomment: “How is this guy still standing? He just has a femur on his leg\nholding him up.” It’s just a cartoon…\n\n**Trusted Reviews:** _[laughs]_\n\n**Stratton:** You’re laughing! That’s exactly what you’re supposed to do.\n\n**Martin:** So the read of it all is, you know, it doesn’t go too far. It’s\nalways striking that balance: insane violence and lighthearted visuals coming\ntogether. That’s Doom. And honestly, it’s the same as Evil Dead II, in my\nopinion. It’s not Saw. It’s like a cartoon. Even when he cuts off his own\nhand, and the way he does it, he’s coming down with the saw and he’s like:\n“Who’s laughing now?” It’s blood spraying in his face, and [Bruce Campbell]\ndid such a great performance there. That’s totally Doom.\n\n**Related:[Best Nintendo Switch\nGames](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/nintendo-switch-games-3435122)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n[Doom Eternal](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/doom-eternal-release-date-\ngameplay-3483704) will release on [PlayStation\n4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/playstation-4), [Xbox\nOne](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/xbox-one-s),\n[PC](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/best-gaming-pc-2993099) and [Nintendo\nSwitch](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nintendo-switch) in 2019.
