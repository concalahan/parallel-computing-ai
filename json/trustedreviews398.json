A new cinematic trailer gave us a polished view of the world of\npiracy, and we even got to try out the game on the show floor. Read on for our\nfirst hand impressions of the game’s multiplayer. **\n\nWho doesn’t love helming their own pirate ship? It proved to be a blast in\n[Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag](https://www.trustedreviews.com/assassin-s-\ncreed-4-black-flag-review) as Edward Kenway sailed across the caribbean in\nsearch of murder, treasure and templars. Now, Ubisoft is adapting the ship\ncombat from Assassin’s Creed into its own, fully-fledged outing. Skull and\nBones is all about the pirate’s life, and it’s definitely for us.\n\n**Pre-order Skull and Bones from[Amazon UK](http://amzn.to/2vAGRKf) | [Amazon\nUS](http://amzn.to/2eHiZjL)**\n\n_TrustedReviews_ has compiled everything you need to know about Skull and\nBones including all the latest news on its release date, gameplay, trailers\nand more.\n\n**Related:[Xbox One X vs PS4 Pro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/xbox-\none-x-vs-ps4-pro-2993235)**\n\n![skull and\nbones](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n# What is Skull and Bones?\n\nDeveloped by Ubisoft Singapore, Skull and Bones is an experience that focuses\nprimarily on naval warfare and being a general menace across the sea.\nFeaturing both single and multiplayer components, you can choose to battle it\nout with friends or go it alone in a quest for naval supremacy.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThe game will be set in the Indian Ocean, after the British Empire stamped out\npiracy in the Caribbean Ocean.\n\nWe know a few things about how the game will be structured. You’ll have a\nhideout where you can purchase upgrades for your ship, and once you’re tooled\nup you can head out onto the open seas to plunder to your heart’s delight. You\ncan disguise your ship as belonging to other countries in order to sneak past\npatrols, but you’ll also be able to take them on in battle if you so choose.\n\nYou’ll need to be careful once your hold is filled with loot, as the\ndemonstration suggested that it will be all too easy to loose your rewards in\nbattle.\n\n# Skull and Bones release date\n\nSkull and Bones is arriving some time in 2018 for\n[PS4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/playstation-4-review), [Xbox\nOne](https://www.trustedreviews.com/xbox-one-review) and\n[PC](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/best-gaming-pc). Originally due to be\npart of Ubisoft’s Winter 2018 line-up, the game has since been delayed until\n2019/2020.  \n**  \nRelated:[Upcoming PS4 Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/upcoming-\nps4-games)**\n\n**![skull and\nbones](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)**\n\n# Skull and Bones Gameplay Preview – How does it play?\n\nFor all its refined combat and exploration, the thing that people always\nremember about Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag is the ship battles, and it’s\nhard to shake the memory of that game when you’re playing Skull and Bones.\n\nThe difference here, of course, is that while ship battles were a side-show in\nUbisoft’s action-adventure epic, here they make up the entirety of the\nexperience where you also get to play alongside other players.\n\nWe were thrown into a roughly 20-minute long match with a group of nine other\nattendees at E3 2018 and were left free to plunder, explore, and otherwise\nindulge in more of the pirate adventures that Black Flag had promised us.\n\nNow that you spend your whole time sailing, it’s a much more complicated\naffair. You constantly have to keep an eye on wind direction in order to make\nyour way around the map, and your objectives are only revealed to you once you\nswitch your view to the Crow’s Nest (and even then your objective will\ndisappear from view after a short period).\n\n**Related:[Assassin’s Creed\nOdyssey](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/assassins-creed-odyssey-release-\ndate-gameplay-3480002)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nTo start with, we were tasked with looting cargo from a number of ships, so we\nset about finding them using the crow’s nest, and making our way there.\n\nOur first problem was the wind. Put simply, it always seemed to be blowing in\nthe wrong direction, preventing us from making effective headway.\n\nThere’s a lot of UI on-screen with Skull and Bones, and we’ll admit it was a\nlittle difficult to work out what all the talk of ‘wind profiles’ meant during\nour brief 20-minute play session. Strangely, despite there being far less\ninformation on screen while you play a game like Sea of Thieves, the amount of\naudio and visual clues given to you by Rare’s adventure makes it easier to\nfeel what you should be doing.\n\nThankfully, once we reached our destinations, combat in Skull and Bones was a\nlot more fun. We chose to play with a ship featuring pretty decent all-round\nabilities, which meant that it featured a balance of speed and firepower.\n\n**Related:[The Division 2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/the-\ndivision-2-release-date-gameplay-3415602) **\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSimply unloading into our opposing ships using our broadside cannons wouldn’t\nhave worked, so we nimbly switched to our front-facing cannons to ruin their\nsales and make it easier to circle them and position ourselves so we could\nfire at them without them firing back.\n\nWith their health depleted, we boarded their ship for extra resources. Rather\nthan seeing our crew leap aboard the enemy ship as we played, however, this\naction started a short cutscene, where we were treated to a montage of our\ncrew jumping aboard and overpowering the enemy vessel.\n\nIt was a similar story when it came to repairing our own ship; rather than\nseeing our crew get to work with planks of wood as we sailed, all the action\ninstead took place in a cutscene, which felt strange considering we were still\ntaking part in a multiplayer match.\n\n**Related:[Beyond Good and Evil 2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/beyond-\ngood-and-evil-2-release-date-2993129) **\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nWith every player assigned to their own objectives, we never had a moment\nwhere we absolutely had to take on another human in naval combat.\nNevertheless, in the spirit of journalism, we bravely pursued our opponent and\npicked a fight that it turned out we had no chance of winning.\n\nWell, perhaps if we’d planned it better we might have had a chance, but as it\nstood we chose to take on a ‘Royal Fortune’ ship, which specialises in having\nbroadside cannons that never need to reload. In contrast, our ship’s special\nability was a ‘ramming attack’, which requires a lot more strategy to use\nsuccessfully. Suffice to say we were forced to take a quick trip to Davy\nJones’ Locker on more than one occasion throughout our match.\n\nBefore long though, our 20 minutes assigned match was over, and it all ended\nup feeling a little anticlimactic.\n\n## First impressions\n\nThere’s a lot going on when you’re playing Skull and Bones. There are UI\nelements to track, objective markers that disappear when you’re not using the\nCrow’s Nest, and different ships with varying specialties that you’ll need to\nbe aware of before you choose to take them on in battle.\n\nAll of this makes it a game that was very difficult to get a handle on during\na single brief play session.\n\nThat said, we hope there’s complexity to Skull and Bones that we were missing\nbecause it didn’t feel like there was a huge amount of depth to the game\nbeyond learning its systems. You approached enemy ships with your small number\nof different weapons, you got them into the sights of the ones that made the\nmost damage, and you hoped the wind didn’t put you at too much of a\ndisadvantage.\n\nWith the game set to release in 2019 we hope there’s enough time to add a\nlittle more strategy, or else make the strategic elements available a little\nmore easy to read and understand to the average player.\n\n# Skull and Bones trailers\n\nWe now have plenty of Skull and Bones gameplay footage to watch. They’re all\nembedded below.\n\n**If you’ve been missing sailing the seas in a Ubisoft title since Assassin’s\nCreed: Black Flag, this could be right up your street**\n\n"}
