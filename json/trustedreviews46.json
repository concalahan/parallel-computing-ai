The notebook scored 5,053 and\n21,165 in Geekbench performance tests.\n\nThat particular MacBook Pro model (albeit with 512GB) costs £2,699/$2,799. The\niPad Pro starts at £749/$799 for the 11-inch 64GB version, while the 512GB\nmodel is £1,119/£1,149.\n\nSo, if you don’t care so much about storage, there’s a saving approaching two\ngrand in the offing. That’s if you feel inclined to make the switch from\nlaptop to tablet – as Apple has been angling for everyone to do since the iPad\narrived.\n\n**Related:[iPad Pro 2018 vs iPad Pro\n2017](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ipad-pro-2018-vs-ipad-\npro-2017-3612809)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n###  Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nOf course there are more things to consider here than just the performance of\nthe processor in benchmarking tests. The MacBook Pro has way more RAM, a\nlarger display and an attached physical keyboard. While no direct comparison\nhas taken place yet, we can safely assume the MacBook Pro enjoys superior\ngraphical performance.\n\nAlso, new iPad Pro users are being asked to fork over at least $179 for the\nnew Magnetic Smart Keyboard folio and a $129 for the new version of the Apple\nPencil, so its not cut and dried by any means.\n\nRegardless, it appears Apple’s bullishness over the A12X being the most\npowerful chip it has ever created was justified. We just weren’t quite ready\nfor it to be _so_ competitive with Intel’s high-end Core i7 processors sitting\nwithin the company’s most powerful laptops.\n\n**Are you weighing a choice between a new MacBook Pro and the brand new Apple\niPad Pro?
