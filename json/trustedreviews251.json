The new heart rate app will show you all of the heart\nbiometric data you could want, including resting heart rate, which is a great\nway to keep tabs on your overall fitness level.\n\nThe Apple Watch will also notify you of an elevated heart rate when it detects\nyou’re not actually active, which could be useful for identifying symptoms\nearly and could potentially be a lifesaver for medical conditions like\nstrokes.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nHeart rhythm is also another metric the Apple Watch will monitor, especially\naround atrial fibrillation. This is characterised by irregular and often\nabnormally fast heart rhythm. This could lead to dizziness, shortness of\nbreath or heart palpitations while your heart races as high as 100BPM. The\nworrying thing is, sometimes atrial fibrillation has no symptoms, so sufferers\ncould be unaware. It’s here that the Apple Watch could be a fantastic medical\ntool.\n\n![Apple Watch Heart Rate\napp](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAs such, all of this information is all part of the Apple Heart Study.
