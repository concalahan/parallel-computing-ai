The first week of season 6 sees players chugging down shields, regaining\nhealth, and searching chests. It’s a fairly easy week to kick things off,\nwhich is considerate given how dangerous Loot Lake has become.\n\nWithout further delay, here’s everything you need to know about completing\nthis week’s [Fortnite](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/fortnite-battle-\nroyale) challenges.\n\n## Fortnite Season 6 Challenges – Free Battle Pass\n\n**Pickup a legendary Item in different matches 0/3**\n\nThis one should be easy enough. If you want it done quick, though, head to\nSalty Springs and land at the blue house. There’s chest chances in the roof,\ndownstairs, then a further two more in the cellar. You’d think of those would\nhave to contain a legendary, right?\n\n**Regain health from a Cozy Campfire 0/150**\n\nAnother easy one. Just keep an eye out for floor loot and you’ll have it done\nin no time. For ease, try playing in 50v50. That’ll allow you to traverse one\nside of the map in search of loot with little to no opposition. Once you find\na campfire, jump off somewhere high enough to damage but not kill you, heal,\nthen repeat.\n\n**Stage 1: Search chests 0/3**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n###  Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nFind three chests and search them. Again, 50v50 is a good place for this,\nwhich, as it happens, also ties into the second and third stages.\n\n**Stage 2: Search supply drops 0/2**\n\nLoad up 50v50 and wait until you hear the supply drop ‘booming’ noise. Look to\nthe sky, then head towards where they’ll be landing. If you can grab a car,\neven better.\n\n**Stage 3: Search a supply llama 0/1**\n\nThis one is going to be a bit more difficult. Llamas can spawn anywhere, so\nthere isn’t a tried and tested route to finding them. You’re best bet is to\ngrab an ATK and drive around the map while looking at the sides of mountains.\nThis isn’t perfect, but llamas are easiest to spot when they’re up against\nflat colour, and the size of mountains should offer enough cover from enemies\nso you don’t get shot up while searching.\n\n**Related:[Best Nintendo Switch\nGames](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/nintendo-switch-games-3435122)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Fortnite Season 6 Challenges – Paid Battle Pass\n\n**Apply Shield 0/500**\n\nYou’ll get this one naturally through play. Mini-shields, big shields, chug\njugs, and slurp juices are your friends here. It’s probably best not to farm\nthis in 50v50. Although you’ll get shields more easily, you won’t see players\nas often and take damage, which allows you to replenish the shields. So maybe\ndon’t think about this one and it’ll pop without much effort.\n\n**Stage 1: Land at Junk Junction**\n\n**Stage 2: Land at Tomato Temple**\n\n**Stage 3: Land at Tilted Towers**\n\n**Stage 4: Land at Fatal Fields**\n\n**Stage 5: Land at Flush Factory**\n\nThese are as easy as they sound, and there’s a way to cheese it if you land\nsomewhere that isn’t listed. In Soaring 50s, you can build a ramp just before\nthe area, glide in, and it’ll still count. So if you’re working on other\nchallenges and end up near the areas listed, you can still progress without\nneeding the battlebus. Cheesy!\n\n**Dance Under Different Streetlight Spotlights 0/7**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nEquip an emote and let it rip under the streetlights (feel free to blast the\nJourney song while you do this). Just head to the pink circles, look for a\nlamppost with speakers attached, then dance like nobody’s watching. You only\nneed seven of areas to complete the challenge so don’t feel like you need to\nvisit each one.\n\n**Eliminate opponents in different named locations 0/5**\n\nCurrently, Tilted Towers and Paradise Palms are the current hot-drops, so\nyou’re almost guaranteed to find people there. Next it’s Salty Springs, Tomato\nTemple, and Lazy Links. If you’re not looking to fight off multiple people,\nhowever, head for somewhere like Lucky Landing where you’ll normally only find\none or two players max.\n\nAs always, for everything Fortnite, be sure check to out our [Fortnite Season\n6 guide](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/fortnite-season-6-news-update-\nskins-weapons-battle-pass-challenges-3505854).\n\n**And you can always chat Fortnite with us on Facebook, or on Twitter\n@TrustedReviews.**\n\n"}
