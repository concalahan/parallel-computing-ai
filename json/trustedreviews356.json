However, it now sounds like it will be\ntreated to a global release.\n\n“I’m positive that we do need a foldable phone,” DJ Koh, the head of Samsung\nMobile, said at the launch of the Samsung Galaxy A9 in Kuala Lumpur in August,\naccording to [SamMobile](https://public.eagleapi.io/magpie/time-inc/trusted-\nreviews/AUTO/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sammobile.com%2F2018%2F10%2F12%2Fsamsung-\nfoldable-device-double-tablet-\nphone%2F&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.trustedreviews.com%2Fnews%2Fsamsung-\ngalaxy-x-release-date-specs-\nprice-2951423&vars%5BipcTags.contentId%5D=2951423&vars%5Bmagpie_data.ga_id%5D=1159076212.1538383863).\n“Possibly when we start selling the foldable phone, it may be a niche market,\nbut definitely, it will expand.”\n\nIt isn’t clear when it could hit the market, but early 2019 is a rumour we’ve\nseen on more than one occasion. Bloomberg reports that Samsung might not be\nready to launch it until at least the second quarter of 2019.\n\nIn its Q3 earnings report, the company further hinted that early 2019 is when\nwe should expect the phone to be released.\n\n“Samsung will strive to expand sales of premium smartphones through\ndifferentiated design and a diversified lineup,” reads [the\nannouncement](https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-announces-\nthird-quarter-2018-results). “The Company will also solidify its market\nleadership by adopting cutting-edge technologies across its entire Galaxy\nlineup, including the Galaxy A series.\n\n“Moreover, Samsung will strengthen its competitiveness in the mid- to long-\nterm by leading innovation with the launch of foldable and 5G smartphones as\nwell as enhancing its Bixby-based AI and IoT services.”\n\nKim Jang-Yeol, the head of research at Golden Bridge Investment, has\n[predicted](https://public.eagleapi.io/magpie/time-inc/trusted-\nreviews/AUTO/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scmp.com%2Fmagazines%2Fstyle%2Ftech-\ndesign%2Farticle%2F2150540%2Fsamsung-keen-claim-worlds-first-foldable-phone-\nlaunch&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.trustedreviews.com%2Fnews%2Fsamsung-galaxy-\nx-release-date-specs-\nprice-2951423&vars%5BipcTags.contentId%5D=2951423&vars%5Bmagpie_data.ga_id%5D=1159076212.1538383863)\nthat the handset could retail for north of $1800 when it hits the shelves.\n\nThat’s actually not a huge amount more than the top-spec [iPhone XS\nMax](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xs-max), but there’s also\nspeculation that the phone will, at least initially, be available in extremely\nlimited quantities.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Samsung Galaxy F: Design and display\n\nThe impression we’ve got is that of a device with two screens − one little and\none large − which can be folded like a book. Koh has said that users will be\nable to see things in greater detail when they fold out the device into its\ntablet form.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, the company is struggling to decide whether a device\nthat flips open horizontally like a book, or a device that flips open\nvertically like the flip phones of yesteryear, would be better. The latter is\nreportedly the current favourite.\n\nThe F will reportedly open and shut with a satisfying snap, much like the\nlegendary Motorola Razr and in testing, its screen is said to have recently\npassed internal tests of surviving being folded more than 200,000 times.\n\nAn [announcement](https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-displays-unbreakable-\npanel-certified-underwriters-laboratories/) back in July sheds more light on\nthe type of panel that could feature on the Galaxy F.\n\n“Samsung Display developed the flexible OLED panel with an unbreakable\nsubstrate and an overlay window securely adhered to it. Current-generation\nflexible display products attach a glass-covered window to their display that\noften breaks when severely impacted,” the company said at the time, adding\nthat it was “especially suitable for portable electronic devices not only\nbecause of its unbreakable characteristics, but also because of its\nlightweight, transmissivity and hardness”.\n\nIn October, it emerged that the South Korean firm had filed a trademark with\nthe Korean Intellectual Property Office ([via\nLetsGoDigital](https://nl.letsgodigital.org/smartphones/samsung-\ngalaxy-s10-infinity-v-display/)) for ‘Samsung Infinity-V’. It appears to be\nthe name Samsung has settled on for its folding smartphone’s display.\n\nThe company introduced the ‘Infinity Display’ (so-called because it stretches\nnearly from edge to edge) with the Samsung Galaxy 8 last year, and it has\nsince featured on numerous Samsung-built handsets.\n\nInfinity V appears to be the next stage. Why V? While we can’t say for sure,\nour best guess is because the V-shape is a perfect representation of what\nSamsung’s folding phone will look like when you switch between phone and\ntablet modes.\n\nSamsung and Google are also said to be working on a special version of Android\nfor the phone.\n\n![Foldable\n](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\n## Samsung Galaxy X: Specs and features\n\nIn terms of specs, the Samsung Galaxy F is believed to be equipped with a\n7.3-inch flexible OLED screen that can unfold to form a medium-sized tablet,\nand a 4.6-inch external OLED screen (the phone display).\n\nIt should also come with an Exynos 9810/Snapdragon 845 CPU and at least 6GB of\nRAM.\n\nAccording to a September report from ET News, the Samsung Galaxy X could\narrive without the Corning Gorilla Glass used to protected the displays of the\nmajority of top-shelf handsets. The firm reportedly plans to use a transparent\npolymer from Sumitomo Chemical of Japan instead.\n\nThis move would assuredly make the display more susceptible to bumps and\nspills, but would enable Samsung’s long-held ambitions to finally come to\nfruition.\n\nSamsung SDI managed to build a foldable battery four years ago, but that only\nhad a 210mAh capacity. Fortunately, the subsidiary is said to be getting close\nto developing one that could realistically power a smartphone.\n\n**Read more:[Best Android phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nandroid-phones-3438996)**\n\nAccording to ITHome, industry sources say it will run on a foldable battery\nbuilt by Samsung SDI, which will have a capacity somewhere between 3000mAh and\n6000mAh. However, Bloomberg claims the battery might have to be downsized, in\norder to keep the handset’s weight down.\n\n**Are you excited about Samsung’s upcoming foldable phone?
