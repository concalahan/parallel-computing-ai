We take a closer look at how the two Android phones compare and size\nup the key specs.**\n\nAndy Rubin took to the stage at the Code 2017 Conference to launch the new\n[Essential Phone](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/essential-phone-rubin-\nrelease-date-price-specs-features-modular-accessories), which certainly looks\nlike an impressive handset.\n\nThe almost full-face screen, ceramic and titanium build, and top-end hardware\nmake it a real competitor on paper, but should the likes of Samsung and Apple\nbe worried?\n\nWell, we thought we’d have a closer look at how the Essential Phone stacks up\nagainst arguably the biggest phone of the moment, Samsung’s Galaxy S8, to see\nif we can answer that question.\n\nWe’re yet to get our hands on the Essential Phone, so it’s too early to say\nfor sure which handset is best, but here’s our early look at how the two\ncompare.\n\n**Related:[Galaxy S8 vs\nS8+](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/galaxy-s8-vs-s8-plus)**\n\n## Essential Phone vs Samsung Galaxy S8 Design: What’s the difference?\n\nIn the Galaxy S8, Samsung introduced what might be the finest looking phone\nwe’ve ever seen. At 8mm thick and weighing just 155g, the Galaxy S8 is\ncertainly a sleek handset, while the 5.8-inch (6.2-inch on the S8+)\n**‘Infinity Display’** wraps around the sides of the phone.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThe 185g Essential Phone has a **5.7-inch edge-to-edge display** , and while\nit doesn’t have the curved edges of the S8, it does push the screen further\nthan Samsung’s rival. That is to say, the display extends to the very top of\nthe phone, almost eliminating the top bezel, whereas the S8 still has a slight\nbezel at the top and bottom of the front face.\n\nThere’s no way to say that one display is ‘better’ than the other, and while\nthe screen on the Essential Phone stretches further than the S8’s, the curved\nedges on the latter look undeniably cool.\n\n**Related:[Best Android phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-android-\nphones-1_round-up)**\n\n![s8plusbeware\n5](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)_Samsung Galaxy S8_\n\nMaterials-wise, the Essential Phone’s **titanium and ceramic body** should,\naccording to Andy Rubin, hold up better in drop tests than the S8’s glass and\naluminium body. That said, Samsung does appear to have an edge when it comes\nto waterproofing, with an **IP68 certification** on the Galaxy S8 meaning it’s\nbeen tested at depths of 1.5 metres for 30 minutes. Thus far, there’s been no\nmention of such a feature on the Essential Phone.\n\nAnd if you’re wondering about ports, you’ll either be pleased or dismayed to\nlearn the **3.5mm headphone jack** has not been included on the Essential\nhandset – the phone does come with an adapter, though. Samsung has opted to\nretain the headphone port, which appears alongside a [**USB\nType-C**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/usb-type-c-everything-you-\nneed-to-know) port on the S8 – that’s the same USB port used by Essential.\n\nOne trick Essential has up its sleeve is the addition of a **magnetic\nconnector** on the rear of the device that allows for **modules** to be\nattached. At this point the only module is the 360-degree camera, but there\nwill surely be more in the future.\n\nSamsung didn’t opt for any modular design elements on the S8, and for good\nreason. Modular phones haven’t proved very popular in the past, and Essential\nis running a risk here. But having the option to make use of add-ons,\nespecially when the phone’s design remains pretty sleek, could just prove to\nbe a plus point for Andy Rubin’s phone in the long run.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S8 is available in, black, silver, and blue colour options,\nwhile the Essential Phone is available in Black Moon, Stellar Grey, Pure\nWhite, and Ocean Depths.\n\n**Related:[What is IP68?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/what-is-\nip68-ip-ratings-explained)**\n\n![Essential\nPhone](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)_The Essential Phone_\n\n## Essential Phone vs Samsung Galaxy S8 specs: Which phone is more powerful?\n\nWe’re yet to test out the Essential Phone, but on paper it matches up to the\nGalaxy S8. Both phones make use of Qualcomm’s [**Snapdragon\n835**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/snapdragon-835-phones-processor-\nspecs-speed-benchmark-chipset-cores) (the S8 comes with Samsung’s own Exynos\n8895 in some territories), and pack **4GB of RAM**. Essential has managed to\noutdo Samsung on the internal memory, however, offering **128GB** as opposed\nto the S8’s **64GB**. However, Samsung has included a **MicroSD card slot** ,\nso you’ll be able to expand the memory beyond the Essential Phone’s 128GB.  \n _  \n_The South Korean firm has also managed to include a slightly larger 5.8-inch\ndisplay (or 6.2-inches with the Galaxy S8+) than the Essential Phone’s\n5.7-inch offering. The S8’s **2960 x 1440 resolution** makes for an incredibly\nsharp image which shouldn’t mean you’re noticing individual pixels, especially\nconsidering the impressive 567 pixel-per-inch (ppi) density. The S8 also makes\nuse of AMOLED tech, too, so colours will be vibrant and blacks noticeably\ndeeper than on an LCD display.\n\nOver on the Essential Phone, you’ll find a similarly impressive **2560 x 1312\nscreen** with a 504 ppi density. It’s not quite as pixel packed as the S8’s\ndisplay, but it should be plenty sharp.\n\n**Related:[Essential Home](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/essential-home-\nrelease-date-price-specs-features-latest-news-uk)**\n\n![s8plusbeware\n21](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)_Samsung Galaxy S8_\n\nOn the rear of the Galaxy S8 you’ll find a **12-megapixel sensor with**\n**optical image stabilisation (OIS)** , and a **wide f1/.7 aperture**. The\nsame dual pixels that appeared on last year’s [Galaxy\nS7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-s7-review) are also present\nthis time around, so you’ll get great low-light performance on the Samsung\nhandset.\n\nThe Essential Phone could potentially give the S8’s shooter a run for its\nmoney, as it comes with **two 13-megapixel lenses** , one of which is\nmonochrome. That means it will take in more light than a traditional sensor,\nwhich should result in impressive overall low-light performance. We’re yet to\ntest it out however, so stay tuned.\n\nSamsung has packed a **3000mAh cell** inside the Galaxy S8, which means you’ll\nget a day’s usage depending on how much you use your phone. The **3040mAh\nbattery** in the Essential Phone should offer similar performance, but again,\nwe’re yet to test it out in full.  \n **  \nRelated:[Galaxy S8 vs Galaxy S7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-\ngalaxy-s8-vs-galaxy-s7)**\n\n![Essential\nPhone](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nOne thing Samsung does have over its new rival is wireless charging, which\ndoesn’t appear on the Essential Phone.\n\n**For a full spec comparison, check out the table below.  \n**  \n ****\n\n|  Samsung Galaxy S8 | Essential Phone  \n---|---|---  \n**Screen** |  5.8 inches (Super AMOLED) | 5.7 inches  \n**Display Resolution** |  2960 x 1440 (567ppi) | 2560 x 1312 (504ppi)  \n**Aspect Ratio** |  18.5:9 | 19:10  \n**Primary Camera** |  12 megapixels | f/1.7 | OIS | 2x 13 megapixels (one\nmonochrome) | f/1.85  \n**Secondary Camera** |  8 megapixels | f/1.7 | AF | 8 megapixels | f/2.2  \n**Chipset** |  Snapdragon 835 (10nm) or Exynos 8995 (10nm) | Qualcomm\nSnapdragon 835  \n**RAM** |  4GB | 4GB  \n**Storage** |  64GB | 128GB  \n**Battery Capacity** |  3000mAh | 3040mAh  \n**Waterproof?** |  Yes (IP68 certified) | No  \n**Fingerprint Scanner?** |  Yes | Yes  \n**Headphone Jack?** |  Yes | No (adapter included)  \n**Primary Port** |  USB Type C | USB Type C  \n**Iris Scanner?** |  Yes | No  \n**Wireless Charging?** |  Yes | No  \n**Micro SD Slot?** |  Yes | No  \n**Dimensions** |  148.9 x 68.1 x 8.0mm | 141.5 x 71.1 x 7.8mm  \n**Weight** |  155 grams | 185 grams  \n**Software** |  Android 7.0 Nougat | Android 7.0 Nougat  \n  \n****\n\n## Essential Phone vs Samsung Galaxy S8 software: What’s running on these\nphones?  \n\nBoth Samsung and Essential’s handsets run [**Android 7.0\nNougat**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/android-7-0-nougat-review), but\nEssential may just have the edge in this department. That’s thanks to the fact\nthe company is promising an untouched version of Nougat, with no bloatware, on\nits phone.\n\nIn fairness, Samsung has improved its Android skin to make the S8 a pleasure\nto use, so it’s not a big deal that you’re not getting an unskinned version of\nGoogle’s OS on the S8. TouchWiz’s childish icons and intrusive additions are\nlong gone, making the S8’s OS powerful and slick **.**\n\nBut there’s no beating an untouched version of Google’s mobile OS, so if\nEssential delivers the goods, the company will have a persuasive selling point\nto market its new phone. It also means that the Essential Phone will likely\nget future version of Android, including [Android\nO](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/android-o-8-features-preview-name-\nrumours-release-date-news-download-beta), quicker than many of its rivals.\n****\n\n****Related:[Best Android apps](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-android-\napps_round-up)****\n\n![Essential\nPhone](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)  \n**  \n**\n\n## Essential Phone vs Samsung Galaxy S8 price: Which phone is better value for\nmoney?\n\nSamsung’s confirmed the Galaxy S8 is available now for **£689** , while the\nS8+ is currently going for **£779**. That’s a lot of money, but it’s in line\nwith what you’d expect to pay for a top-end flagship device in 2017.\n\nUnfortunately, the Essential Phone will only be available in the US at first,\nwhere it’ll cost **$699** (about £545). An exact shipping date hasn’t been\noffered, but Andy Rubin said pre-orders should start going out in the next\n30-days, meaning it’ll be out in the wild by the end of June.\n\n**Related:[Best smartphone](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-\nsmartphone_round-up)**\n\n![s8plusbeware\n15](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)_Samsung Galaxy S8_\n\n## Essential Phone vs Samsung Galaxy S8 Summary: What’s the difference?\n\nHere’s a short breakdown of the key differences between the Samsung Galaxy S8\nand the Essential Phone (PH-1).\n\n**Design** : Samsung’s usually got its competitors beat in this department,\nand will probably still come out on top when compared to the Essential Phone.\nStill, the latter’s almost full-face screen and titanium/ceramic build could\ngive the S8’s curved edge screen, glass body, and lack of a home button some\ntrouble.\n\n**Specs:** The two phones are pretty evenly matched, with both using a\nSnapdragon 835 processor, 4GB of RAM, and generally looking to be speedy\ndevices. The S8 does come with a few extras such as a MicroSD card slot and\nwireless charging, however.\n\n**Price:** Samsung wants £689 for the S8, while the S8+ will run you £779. And\nwhile the $699 price tag on the Essential Phone is cheaper, the handset won’t\nbe launching outside of the US for now.\n\n**Value:** This one’s hard to call. We are yet to review the Essential Phone,\nbut it’s certainly cheaper than the S8, and comes with almost as many\nfeatures. Still, the S8 packs in extra offerings such as wireless charging and\nwaterproofing for not all that much more cash. And given the uncertainty\nsurrounding the Essential Phone’s global availability, if you need a premium\nAndroid handset in your pocket right now, it’s the Galaxy S8 you’ll want to\nplump for.\n\n**Let us know whether you’d buy an Essential Phone over an S8 in the\ncomments.**\n\n"}
