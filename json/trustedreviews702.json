The 10kWh unit, which the firm says has been\ndesigned for back-ups during outages, is the more expensive of the two and it\ncosts $3,500 (around $2,281).\n\nThe 7kWh unit, which has been designed for daily use, such as in the ‘load\nshifting’ and solar consumption applications is $3,000 (about $1,995). This\ncosting will enable home owners to make considerable savings on their energy\nbills down the years.\n\nDuring the event late on Thursday, Elon Musk said the units will begin\nshipping to customers in 3-4 months. Production will be slow to begin with,\nbut will be ramped up next year when the firm transfers operations to its new\nGigafactory in Nevada next year.\n\nTesla has promised a roll out in Australia and Germany by the end of the year,\nbut there’s no word on a UK launch yet. The firm also plans an expansion to\nsmall businesses in 2016.\n\nElsewhere during the event, Musk announced Tesla Energy’s ambition to “change\nthe way the world uses energy at an extreme scale,” with its “infinitely\nscaleable” Powerpack solution. These batteries can even bring power to entire\nindustries and utility companies.\n\nMusk says 160 million of these Powerpacks could power the whole of America,\nwhile 2 billion of them could bring power to the whole world.\n\n"}
