We tried it during a hands-on session with the Mate 20 Pro and while\nthe setup required a good deal of time, it worked reliably once ready. It also\njust felt rather futuristic pressing down on the screen and having it unlock.\n\n**Related:[Best smartphones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nsmartphone-3431175)**\n\nIn-display fingerprint tech has been rumoured for inclusion in high-profile\ndevices from Apple and Samsung for a number of years now, but it’s yet to\nmaterialise. That’s not to say it’s a completely new idea, Vivo included it in\nthe [Vivo Nex S](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/vivo-nex) and even\nHuawei itself in the very expensive [Mate\nRS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/huawei-mate-rs-porsche-design).\n\nBut, it’s inclusion in the Mate 20 Pro feels like the tech has finally hit the\nmainstream.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nIt’s not all good news, though. Due to the way the in-display sensor works,\nit’s not currently recognised by apps that would previously be unlocked by a\ntypical fingerprint sensor. Banking apps, for example, will just default to\nasking you for your pin-code.\n\nIn-display goodness aside, the Mate 20 Pro packs the latest Kirin 980 chipset,\nthree rear cameras and the ability to charge other phones wirelessly.\n\n**Do you think in-display fingerprint sensor are the way forward?
