{"result": 0, "title": "Dolby Vision HDR: Everything you need to know | Trusted Reviews", "description": "* [HDR]()Fortunately this DV/LG OLED issue only crops up occasionally during a typicalfilm (and I didn’t really notice it at all during the Despicable Me films,perhaps because of their animated nature). You can also pretty much remove theproblem by reducing the TV’s brightness to around 46 from its 50 default.Though doing this reduces the image’s dynamism a little, and can lead to alittle detail loss in the darkest areas.It’s also true that to some extent this occasional greyness is ultimately downto a limitation of the TV. Given that part of Dolby Vision’s appeal, though,is its ability to get the very best out of whatever screen it’s being playedon, it seems unfortunate that its optimisation processes seem to have missedthe OLED brightness limitation that LG’s own internal HDR10 management seemsto take into account.The bottom line, though, is that overall and for the vast majority of thetime, Dolby Vision on Ultra HD Blu-ray is a surprisingly resounding success.Turning next to Dolby Vision on streamed video, I should start by pointing outthat I had to change the testing procedure quite a bit. After all, when aNetflix or Amazon stream detects that you’re using a Dolby Vision TV, itautomatically feeds you the Dolby Vision stream; you can’t opt to watch HDR10instead. So I had to run Dolby Vision streams on the LG OLED55C7 alongsideHDR10 streams of the same shows on a Samsung UE65KS9500.Using a combination of Okja, Glow, Bosch 2 and Marco Polo, the good news isthat Dolby Vision again appears to deliver a noticeable improvement overHDR10. The picture once more exhibits more subtle colours, more sensitivelight control, more detail in the brightest areas, and a cleaner, clearer lookto densely detailed areas such as those in the forest where we first meetOkja.I’d thought that maybe Dolby Vision could deliver a greater benefit with thereduced picture quality associated with streaming than it did with somethingas pristine as 4K Blu-ray. Actually, the opposite is true. There certainlystill seems to be some benefit in terms of overall image refinement, though.Strangely the Dolby Vision streams on the LG OLED TV looked noticeably lessbright and dynamic than the HDR10 images on the Samsung set. It’s difficult tosay, though, how much of this is down to a deliberate ‘reining in’ decision bythe Dolby Vision system, and how much it’s down to the Samsung TV usingbrighter LCD technology.While I can imagine some people preferring the more aggressive look ofSamsung’s streamed HDR10 presentation, there’s no doubt that with all aspectsof picture quality taken into account the Dolby Vision picture contains moreinsight and finesse, and so may be preferable to the ‘enthusiast’ market.I should briefly mention a separate issue with streamed HDR content wherebysome titles, at least, look more natural in standard dynamic range than theydo in HDR. Recent release Glow, for instance, looks oddly fragile and washedout in HDR compared with the SDR image, while Bosch 2’s dark scenes tend tolook noisier and suffer reduced black level depth in HDR versus their SDRcounterparts. Okja, on the other hand, generally looks much superior in HDR.Potential issues with the way the streaming services master for HDR is adiscussion for another day, though. The issue at hand here is whether DolbyVision delivers a better experience than HDR10. And the short answer is thatyes, it does. In some cases dramatically so.**Related:[Best TV](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-tv-3440232)**## Dolby Vision vs HDR10: What’s the difference?We’ve said in no uncertain terms that Dolby Vision is superior to HDR10, butwhy?The main specification differences are that Dolby Vision masters of movies aredone at 12-bit, rather than HDR10’s 10 bits.Also, peak brightness can go – in theory, at least – right up to 10,000lumens. In reality, most Dolby Vision masters seem to be targeting 4,000 nits– which remains a very big step up from the 1,000 nits that HDR10 masters workto.But most significant is how Dolby Vision uses frame-by-frame metadata tomanage HDR performance. This helps to deliver the best results as it adaptsthe source material to the performance of your TV.This is why Dolby Vision requires the extra hardware we’ve talked about, andultimately why HDR10 and Ultra HD Premium are likely to be the more prevalentstandards. But the Dolby argument is this hardware will deliver better picturequality, and we agree.And, in case you were concerned, anything that supports Dolby Vision supportsHDR10 by default, it just doesn’t work in the reverse.**Related:[Best 4K TV](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/4k-tv-3500597)**## Dolby Vision: Should your next TV support Dolby Vision?This is a tricky one. Dolby Vision does, from all the evidence I’ve seen sofar, deliver a superior viewing performance to standard HDR10. So as moreDolby Vision content turns up I can certainly imagine some, maybe many, AVfans only wanting to buy gear that supports it.That said, it’s possible to buy TVs from the likes of Samsung and Panasonicthat deliver excellent quality from HDR10 alongside some unique picturefeatures – such as extreme colour volumes and ambient light management inSamsung’s QLED case, and Hollywood-tuned video processing in Panasonic’s OLEDcase. Then there’s the HDR10+ format being pushed as an alternative to DolbyVision.At this point it’s too early to say which format will ‘win’ and become moreprevalent in the industry. That being said, if your TV or smartphone supportsDolby Vision, take that as a good thing."}
