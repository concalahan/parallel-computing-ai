Let’s see how the Pixel 2 compares to\nthe brand-new Pixel 3 and [Pixel 3\nXL](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-3-xl).\n\n## **Pixel 3 vs Pixel 2: Is the design different?**\n\nJust like with the Pixel 2, both the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL look different.\nThis is a different approach to Apple, who tend to keep its two phones sizes\nlooking very similar.\n\n**Related:[iPhone XS review](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xs)\n| [iPhone XS Max review](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xs-\nmax)**\n\nThe Pixel 3 looks most like the Pixel 2 XL thanks to the 18:9 display and\nthinner bezels. The Pixel 3 XL, on the other hand, adds a notch into the\nequation – a rather large notch. This means that if you watch lots of video\nit’ll likely get in the way, provided you’re watching in the phone’s native\naspect ratio. The notch here feels a lot more intrusive than on other phones\nwith a similar style. We’ll likely get used to it over time – hopefully.\n\nGoogle has also switched to a completely glass back, rather than having a\nglass portion sitting above a metal area. This makes the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3\nXL the first Pixel phones to support Qi wireless charging.\n\n**Related:[Best smartphones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nsmartphone-3431175)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Call of Cthulhu](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n###  Call of Cthulhu\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/call-of-cthulhu \"Call of Cthulhu\")\n\n  * [ ![iPad Pro 2018](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: MySmartPrice / @OnLeaks \n\n### New iPad Pro 2018 leak shows Apple is almost certainly dropping the Home\nbutton\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ipad-pro-2018-release-date-specs-\nprice-3482812 \"New iPad Pro 2018 leak shows Apple is almost certainly dropping\nthe Home button\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Pete Lau on stage at the OnePlus 6T launch](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### The OnePlus 6T ditched the headphone jack, CEO Pete Lau tells us why\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ceo-pete-lau-oneplus-6t-headphone-jack-\nwireless-charging-3612475 \"The OnePlus 6T ditched the headphone jack, CEO Pete\nLau tells us why\")\n\n  * \n\nThere’s no headphone jack on either the Pixel 2 series nor the duo of Pixel\n3s, however, an IP68 rating is still here along with the rear-mounted\nfingerprint sensor. USB-C is the main charging connection and that sits on the\nbottom.\n\nThe colours these phones come in are slightly different too. The Pixel 3 came\nin white, blue and black, with the Pixel 2 XL getting rid of the blue option.\nThere’s a bit more parity with the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL as they both come\nblack, white and a light shade of pink, confusingly named ‘Not Pink’.\n\n## **Pixel 3 vs Pixel 2: What’s new with the specs and features?**\n\nAs you’d expect with a yearly upgrade of a flagship phone, the Pixel 3 and\nPixel 3 XL improve the chipset used to power the phones.\n\nThe Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL were both powered by the Snapdragon 835, with the\nPixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL upping that to the newer Snapdragon 845. The 845 offers\nimproved speed in both the GPU and CPU, along with support for gigabit LTE.\n\n4GB RAM remains the same across all the Pixel phones and it seems odd that\nGoogle hasn’t upped that to at least 6GB for the Pixel 3 or Pixel 3 XL.\nStorage still starts at 64GB too (again with no microSD) with a 128GB option\navailable too.\n\nDuring the announcement for the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL, Google talked up the\ncamera capabilities of the phones heavily. The 12.2-megapixel _f/_ 1.8 camera\nremains similar in terms of specs, however, Google has again worked hard on\nthe computational side of things and some of the demo images it showed off\nlooked truly stunning.\n\n**Related:[Best Android Phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nandroid-phones-3438996)**\n\nThe camera app has been tweaked too and it seems much easier to quickly jump\nbetween different modes including new additions Top Shot, Super Res Zoom and\nNight Sight. Some of these features will then trickle down to the older Pixel\ndevices too.\n\nThere are changes on the front camera as well. On the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL\nthere was a single 8-megapixel selfie shooter – but now there are two of them.\nOne of them remains your standard, closely-cropped sensor with the other being\nwide-angle – called the Group Selfie Cam. Having a wider camera allows you to\ncram more faces into the photos.\n\nThe Pixel 3’s battery is marginally larger than the Pixel 2’s while the Pixel\n3 XL actually packs in a slightly smaller cell than 2017’s XL model.\n\nThe Pixel 2 had a 5-inch screen, with the Pixel 2 XL upping that to 6-inches.\nBoth new phones announced today have larger screens than their predecessors.\nThe Pixel 3 has a 5.5-inch FHD+ 18:9 display with the Pixel 3 XL boasting a\n6.3-inch 2960 x 1440 18.5:9 panel. HDR support is here too.\n\n## **Pixel 3 vs Pixel 2: Are they more expensive?**\n\nGoogle’s upped the starting price of this year’s Pixels, with the Pixel 3\ncoming in at a far-from-trivial £739/$799 and the 3 XL costing £869/$899, with\nan additional £100/$100 added onto each if you opt for the larger 128GB\nstorage capacity.\n\n## **Early verdict**\n\nThe Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL look like good phones, however, they seem to be\nvery minor updates over the outgoing models. There’s been a bump in specs and\nsome nice features added – wireless charging being one – but nothing we’d\nconsider substantial. Of course, that could all change when we properly spend\nsome time with those shiny new cameras.\n\n"}
