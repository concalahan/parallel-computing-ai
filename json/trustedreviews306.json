However, we’re just about in\nNovember and, despite various hints, it’s nowhere to be seen. **\n\nIt now appears LG is preparing to commandeer that thunder by returning to the\narena it first visited in 2015. The word that LG is preparing its own\nsmartphone with a foldable display comes from noted tipster Evan “@evleaks”\nBlass, who reckons LG is lining-up an unveiling at CES 2019, in early January.\n\nThis wouldn’t be LG’s first rodeo. The company launched the [G\nFlex](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/lg-g-flex) phone way back in\n2015. It arrived with a banana-shaped display, which shaped naturally to the\nface. However, the more impressive innovation was the way the phone was able\nto bend under strain. It was possible to push the device flat from a face down\nposition without damaging the display.\n\n> I can't speak for Samsung…\n\n>\n\n> …but I do know that LG plans to unveil a foldable phone at its 2019 CES\nkeynote.\n\n>\n\n> — Evan Blass (@evleaks) [October 31,\n2018](https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1057571022931722240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nThe company followed this up with the [G Flex\n2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/lg-g-flex-2) in 2016, but like many\nof LG’s recent smartphone innovations, the trend failed to catch on.\n\nOf course, approaching four years on, the idea of what we expect from an\nadvanced smartphone with a flexible display has changed. The next-generation\nwill be expected to actually fold and, according to Blass, that’s what LG\nplans to show off.\n\n**Related:[Best Android phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-android-\nphones-1_round-up)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![G Flex](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) The 2015 LG G Flex \n\n###  LG foldable phone set for CES 2019 – could it steal Samsung’s thunder?\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-foldable-phone-3613552 \"LG foldable\nphone set for CES 2019 – could it steal Samsung’s thunder?\")\n\n  * [ ![Blizzcon 2018](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### BlizzCon 2018: All you need to know before this weekend’s big show\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/blizzcon-2018-news-dates-virtual-ticket-\ngoody-bag-schedule-3603422 \"BlizzCon 2018: All you need to know before this\nweekend’s big show\")\n\n  *   * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### This surprise free Undertale spinoff is a spooky Halloween miracle\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/gaming/surprise-free-undertale-spinoff-\nspooky-halloween-miracle-3613524 \"This surprise free Undertale spinoff is a\nspooky Halloween miracle\")\n\n  * \n\nThere’s still a couple of months for Samsung to make its unveiling here.\nPreviously, the company hinted its foldable phone will arrive at its\ndevelopers’ conference, which takes place next week on November 7-8.\n\nIt’s still not clear whether the device Samsung showcases will be ready for\nconsumers, or its yet another prototype on the road to an eventual launch.\n\nRegardless, after a year fretting about notches and in-display fingerprint\nsensors, we may finally get some more transformative smartphone design\nfeatures in 2019.\n\n**Is a foldable display the smartphone trend you’re most looking forward to in\n2019?
