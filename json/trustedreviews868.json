I say ‘cheaper’ but at\n£749/$749, this is far from the budget iPhone many were expecting before\nlaunch.\n\nInstead, Apple here takes the formula set by the iPhone XS (and the [iPhone\nX](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-x)) and slightly tweaks it to\nfit the lower price. There’s only one camera on the back, the stainless-steel\nrim has been swapped out for aluminium (as on the [iPhone\n8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-8)) and LCD replaces OLED as\nthe tech used in the screen.\n\n## **iPhone XR release date – When’s it out?**\n\n_The iPhone XR is available now from Apple directly and networks like EE, O2\nand Three. Check out our best iPhone XR deals for more information._\n\n## **iPhone XR price – How much does the iPhone XR cost?**\n\n_The iPhone XR starts at £749/$749 for the 64GB model. £799/$799 for the 128GB\nversion and £899/$899 for the top-end 256GB model. Each of the available\ncolours – coral, blue, yellow, black, white, (PRODUCT) RED – can be picked up\nin all sizes and cost the same price._\n\n## **iPhone XR – Design**\n\nWhere I think the iPhone XR beats the XS is in design. It doesn’t feel as\n‘classy’ but the aluminium band is less slippery than the latter’s stainless\nsteel and the 6.1-inch screen size feels like a nice compromise between the\n5.8-inch iPhone XS and 6.5-inch XS Max. It looks very much like a mashup of\nthe [iPhone X](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-x) and [iPhone\n8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-8).\n\nThere’s glass on both the front and the back, and it holds an IP67 rating,\nmeaning it can be submerged in a variety of liquids for up to 30 minutes. But\nthere’s still no headphone jack here, and not even a 3.5mm dongle inside the\nbox.\n\n**Related:[IP67 vs IP68?](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/what-is-\nip68-ip-ratings-explained-2947135)**\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n![iPhone\nXR](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nEven though it follows the near edge-to-edge look of the iPhone X, there’s a\nthicker bezel here surrounding the display. This becomes slightly more\nprominent when you’re using a coloured variation of the iPhone XR. With my red\nreview unit, for example, the black bezel stands out more against its bright\nred sides.\n\nI do find it odd that even though Apple is positioning this as the default\niPhone pick, it’s not offering a smaller version. I know lots of people who\nstill find the iPhone 8 too big and too long, and would prefer something more\npocketable. The iPhone XR certainly isn’t that.\n\nBut being able to pick up this phone in a variety of colours makes it a bit\nmore interesting. There’s a pinky-orange coral, a vivid red and a couple of\nmore pastel shades of blue and yellow. For those who want something a bit more\nconservative, there are also white and black options. The range of colours is\ngreat and there isn’t one that stands out as looking ugly: they’re all\ncoloured well and each reacts a bit differently when light hits its glass\nback.\n\n## **iPhone XR – Screen**\n\nThe feature most people have been concerned about with the iPhone XR is the\nscreen. Not so much because of the switch back to LCD rather than OLED, but\nfor the seemingly meagre 1792 x 828 resolution. This gives the same 326ppi as\nthe iPhone 6, iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 – but it’s far from the 1080p resolution\nof the Plus range of iPhones.\n\n**Related:[LCD vs OLED](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/oled-vs-led-\nlcd-2924602)**\n\nApple is calling this a Liquid Retina display, a moniker it has also attached\nto the [iPad Pro 2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ipad-\npro-2018-release-date-specs-price-3482812). After using it for an extended\nperiod, I honestly think it’s _fine_. If you’re coming from an iPhone 7 or 8,\nyou’ll feel right at home. And if you have an iPhone X, you’re probably not\ngoing to be thinking about getting the XR anyway.\n\nLCD lacks the punchy colours, perfect blacks and support for Dolby\nVision/HDR10 that the OLED on iPhone XS gives you. But in normal use colours\nare still pleasant and you can’t spot individual pixels unless you really go\nsearching for them.\n\nTo my eyes, the screen is a little more yellow than the OLED on my iPhone XS\nMax. However, that might just be the True Tone (Apple’s software tweak that\nmakes colours softer on your eyes in certain environments) tech doing a bit\ntoo much work.\n\nLike all of Apple’s current iPhones, the screen is ridiculously responsive.\nThe panel itself remains 60Hz but the touch-layer is 120Hz and your swipes and\ntaps are registered instantly.\n\n![iPhone\nXR](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nImpressively, Apple has managed to ensure the curves in the corners of the\nscreen and around the protruding notch are perfectly uniform – without any\nstray pixels or wonky edges. This is done through a combination of pixel-\nmasking and anti-aliasing, and the results are excellent. Look at any\ncompeting Android phones with LCDs and curved corners, and you’ll notice ugly\njagged edges.\n\nSitting at the top of the screen is a notch – a small-ish cutout, where the\nbevy of Face ID sensors and front-facing cameras sit. In the year since Apple\nfirst introduced a notched-style device, it has become popular for Android\nmanufacturers to follow suit, with many making it part of the design. Your\nfeelings on the notch will likely be very varied and that’s fair – it does get\nin the way when watching videos. For everything else, it blends into the\nbackground and doesn’t detract from what’s on the display.\n\n## **iPhone XR – Performance**\n\nPowering the iPhone XR is [Apple’s A12\nBionic](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-a12-bionic-3462239) SoC\n(system on a chip) paired with 3GB of RAM. This is the same chipset used in\nthe iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max. However, both of those phones have 4GB RAM.\n\nBeing a 7nm chip, as opposed to the 10nm chip of the A11 Bionic, allows a\ngreater number of transistors to be packed inside the silicone. This leads to\na more efficient chip. The main features for the new chip are a 15% faster\nCPU, 50% faster GPU (both when compared with the A11 Bionic) and a new neural\nengine for AI. There’s also an updated ‘secure enclave’ inside the chip that\naids the snappier Face ID.\n\n**Related:[Best phablets](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nphablet-3500572)**\n\nThe general processor improvements aren’t huge when compared with the 2017\niPhones. But for anyone updating from an iPhone 6, iPhone 6S or iPhone 7,\nyou’ll notice everything moves a lot quicker. Apps open instantly, there’s no\njank when multitasking and I’ve noticed app crashes are very rare.\n\nThere’s so much power available here that you’ll likely not utilise it all\nstraight away. Apple’s having a big push with augmented reality (AR) and this\nwill demand more power when developers really start to push it to its limits.\n\n![iPhone\nXR](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe A12 Bionic should also allow the iPhone XR to stay fast for multiple\nyears. When you think Apple has only just stopped selling the four-year-old\niPhone 6S, it becomes obvious this iteration will be around for a long time.\nOf course, I can’t comment on how fast the iPhone XR will be 18 to 24 months\ndown the line. But Apple’s recent focus with iOS 12 on ensuring legacy devices\nstill perform well gives plenty of hope.\n\nThe iPhone XR is a great pick too if you’re an avid mobile gamer. It doesn’t\npack some of the fancy features you get with the [Razer Phone\n2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/razer-phone-2) (120Hz refresh rate)\nor [ROG Phone](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/rog-phone) (a mix of\ngaming-focused accessories). But instead, it offers plenty of power and the\nwide-range of excellent games available on the App Store. Intensive titles,\nsuch as Asphalt 9 and PUBG, run fantastically well and match the pricier\niPhone XS for loading and frame rates.\n\nFor benchmark scores, see below.\n\n![Antutu scores / iPhone\nXR](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n![Geekbench 4 scores / iPhone\nXR](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n![3D Mark scores / iPhone\nXR](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nFor all new iOS devices in late 2018, Apple has completely moved away from\nTouch ID fingerprint unlocking. Putting so much faith in its [Face\nID](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/face-id-3286453) facial unlocking\nmeans it has to work reliably. Thankfully, Apple succeeds with this: Face ID\nis reliable at bursting into life when you look at the phone and it works even\nin a pitch-black environment.\n\nUnlike some more basic facial authentication systems on other phones, Face ID\ncan’t be fooled by a photo and learns your appearance over time. You won’t\nhave to retrain it if you get a haircut or shave off a bushy beard. It\ncomfortably recognised me with or without my glasses.\n\niPhone XR will likely be a lot of people’s first experience with Face ID and I\ncan’t see many of them being disappointed.\n\nThe speakers (one of which sits on the bottom and other in the notch) are\nlouder and clearer than those on any previous iPhone, matching excellent\nAndroid handsets out there (apart from the Razer Phone 2). Apple has levelled\nout the sound so that the downward speaker is no longer more powerful. This\ngives you a more balanced sound that isn’t dominated in a particular area.\n\nCall quality and wireless reception are both good, but not to the level of\nsome other phones out there. On both the [Huawei Mate 20\nPro](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/huawei-mate-20-pro) and [Samsung\nGalaxy S9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9), I get\nreliably stronger internet from my home router and tend to get better speeds\non Three’s network when I’m out.\n\n## **iPhone XR – Software**\n\niPhone XR ships with iOS 12, which can now be upgraded to iOS 12.1. iOS 12’s\nfocus on stability and reliability, particularly on older devices, means there\nisn’t really a massive user-facing change here.\n\nThe general user interface remains the same: swipe up from the lock screen to\naccess the standard gridded view of your apps. A left swipe brings up the\nToday view: a space for widgets to sit. It’s all very basic and will be\nfamiliar to anyone who has ever used an iPhone or iPad.\n\n**Related:[iOS 12](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/ios-12-features-\ndevices-3385158)**\n\nPerformance improvements aside, iOS 12 adds a couple of features that you’ll\ndefinitely want to look at. Screen Time is a new area in the Settings panel,\ndesigned to give you more control over how long you spend looking at your\nphone. In addition to receiving a weekly overview of how much time you spend\nusing specific apps, you can also restrict app use to certain times, or set a\ntime limit. For instance, I set it up so that once I had spent 30 minutes on\nInstagram a day, it would block further access.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThis is great for parents too, as you can block whole categories of apps\n(social media, for example) during certain hours.\n\niOS 12.1 adds in dual-sim support – but this is very much dependant on your\nnetwork provider. You can now also have group call in FaceTime.\n\nThanks to the Face ID system, there’s Animoji and Memoji on the iPhone XR.\nThese augmented reality emojis blend your facial animations with various\ncharacters and can be pretty addictive. They’re limited to iMessage, which\nseems odd. Surely there must be plans to brand them off into a singular app?\n\nDue to the lack of a physical home button, your main interaction with the\niPhone XR is through a selection of gestures. Swipe up from the bottom to go\nto the Home Screen, pull down from the top left for notifications and top\nright for Control Center. Once you’ve got over the initial learning curve,\nit’s mostly a straightforward process.\n\n[ Next  \nCamera ](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xr-camera)\n\n"}
