Offering\nfaster transfer rates and a reversible cable tip, we’ve already seen USB-C on\na number of devices, including Apple’s new 12in MacBook.\n\n**SEE ALSO:[Best Android Smartphones\n2015](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-android-phones-1_round-up)**\n\nOf course, both Google and Huawei have yet to reveal anything about the new\nphone, so take this report with a pinch of salt.\n\nIt’s also worth mentioning that Google is also tipped to be working with South\nKorean tech giant LG on a new Nexus 5 device for 2015.\n\nBoth handsets are expected to launch in October or November this year, but we\ndon’t have a release date confirmed at this point.\n\nAlso note that the phones will mark the debut of [Android\nM](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/android-m-features), Google’s next\nmobile operating system.\n\nWhat do you want to see from Google’s next Nexus handset?
