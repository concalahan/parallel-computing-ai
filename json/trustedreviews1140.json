When opening any internet connected application, a pop-up window\nwill appear with an invitation to update the set. Once done, the TV can then\nbe set-up with a compatible speaker through the Google Home or Alexa app.\n\nTwo TVs that have received the update were the\n[F952](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/panasonic-fz950-fz952-oled) and\n[F802](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/panasonic-fz802-fz800-oled) OLED\nTVs and we gave both of them high praise. It’s been a year where Panasonic has\narguably stepped up its performance in the realm of 4K TVs.\n\n**Is voice control a feature you use when watching TV?
