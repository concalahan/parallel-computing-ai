{"result": 0, "title": "Fortnite Battle Royale vs PUBG: Which is right for you?? | Trusted Reviews", "description": "![]()##  **PUBG vs Fortnite Battle Royale –** **Combat**  This is too close to call, despite the fact that these two games couldn’t feelmore different to control. PUBG feels like wrestling a sentient fridge intodoing what you want, and Fortnite is so slick and simple it almost feelsflimsy. It comes down to whether you prefer adjusting zeroing distances onyour scope, or watching numbers fly off above the heads of your enemies astheir hit points scatter through the air.Honestly, I don’t have a preference. I do know that Fortnite: Battle Royale isa great big palate-cleanser after 100 hours of PUBG – it feels amazing to geta few kills every round, even when you’re not playing very well. But winning afirefight in PUBG is so difficult that it inevitably feels like more of anachievement.You could make a case for Fortnite: Battle Royale being the more mechanicallyaccomplished and polished in this regard, and I’d back you up on it if youdid, but that doesn’t necessarily make the fighting more fun._**Winner: draw**_##  **PUBG vs Fortnite Battle Royale –** **Verdict**  It’d be easy to look at Fortnite: Battle Royale and say ‘I bet they justcopied Battlegrounds because it’s so popular’, because that’s pretty self-evident. But Epic deserves a huge amount of credit for creating such adifferent experience by tweaking just a few variables. It plays at such afaster pace, with more of a risk-taking spirit. Add to this its lovely base-building crescendo and you could easily justify playing PUBG and Fortnitealongside each other in the long term. They’re cut from the same cloth, nodoubt, but the results vary more than it might appear.* * ***Buy PUBG from[Amazon UK](http://amzn.to/2rGGOP1)****Buy Fortnite from[Amazon UK](http://amzn.to/2rHPEvJ) |[Amazon.com](http://amzn.to/2DGpi31)*** * *_**Which game do you prefer?
