You’ll get caught out and this isn’t dodging a forcedWindows upgrade, after all…We’ve asked Apple for UK education pricing figures, and will update thisarticle when we hear back.What we also know is that discounts apply across Apple’s range, but differentproducts are discounted at different rates.In the US, there’s no barrier and the price differences are therefore muchclearer. If you’re a student or member of staff, you can get the new 2018 iPadfor $309 rather than $329. That’s a handy little reduction well worth takingadvantage of.We’d expect similar discounts on Apple products here in Blighty, though notethat said new Apple tablet already enjoys a £20 price cut (compared to theprevious 2017 model) when buying in the UK. So you may already be in luck, asit were.The new tablet is available in silver, space grey and gold colour schemes, andwill begin shipping to buyers this week.If you’re eligible, be sure to head over to the [Apple Store forEducation](https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/browse/home/education_routing/find_your_institution/access)page to check out the discounts.**What are your initial thoughts on the new iPad?
