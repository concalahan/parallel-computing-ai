A far cry from the boxy sedan of 1994 origins, the\nnew A8 is the crème-de-la-crème of Audi’s luxury vehicles, and it comes with\nall the bells and whistles you’d expect. From a 17-foot wheelbase to a semi-\nautonomous driving system, it’s an imposing feat of vehicular engineering –\nbut the sound system is what Audi is really making noise about.\n\n_Trusted Reviews_ got a rare opportunity to go behind closed doors at Audi’s\nheadquarters in Germany – which houses an incredible 44,000 employees, sprawls\nover 29.5 million square-feet, and turns out nearly 600,000 vehicles a year –\nto meet the team that designed the new A8’s impressive sound system, and learn\nwhat it takes to create top-end car audio.\n\nUnsurprisingly, it’s painstaking work.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: Audi\n\n## Building car sound systems is ‘another planet’\n\nThe most advanced version of the new Audi A8’s sound system was built in\npartnership with audio experts from Bang & Olufsen. Together, the teams\ncreated what they reckon is a genuine 3D sound system that makes you feel as\nthough you’re in an orchestra hall – rather than the back seat of a full-size\nsedan.\n\nTo do this, Audi sourced 23 loudspeakers for every Audi A8 from ASK – an\nItalian speaker firm – each of which were then tuned in-house by Audi experts.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nThese speakers are dotted all around the car; woofers (which are individually\nboxed, for minimum noise leakage) are housed in all four doors, while a huge\nsub-woofer resides in the rear shelf. There are even several speakers built\ndirectly in the ceiling, for mid-to-high frequency audio from above.\n\nThe problem, Audi’s experts explain, is that unlike a studio or concert hall,\na car is one of the worst possible environments for designing a quality audio\nsetup.\n\n**Related:[Range Rover Velar](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/range-rover-\nvelar-2017-price-release-date-specs-features-preview-3068648)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: Audi\n\n“It’s difficult in every way,” Thomas Ott, an acoustics expert at Audi,\nspeaking exclusively to _Trusted Reviews_. “The room, the reflections, the\nglass. It’s another planet, you know. And that’s interesting for working\nbecause every new car is another planet. You can’t use the same system in\nevery car.”\n\nIn fact, Audi even commissioned a brand new algorithm – the Fraunhofer\nSymphonia 2.0 3D algorithm – for the Audi A8 to make sure it sounded better\nthan any Audi ever built to date. This algorithm was designed by Germany’s\nprestigious Fraunhofer Institute, and I’m told it will almost certainly\nfeature in future Audi vehicles.\n\n## Designing great audio doesn’t come cheap\n\nAudi benefits from the scale of its operations. Unlike smaller car makers,\nAudi has plenty of cash to splash; last year in made a pre-tax profit of €1.5\nbillion and generated over €50 billion in revenue. This means it can invest in\nserious sound infrastructure.\n\nFor instance, the Audi team proudly shows off its anechoic chamber, a room-in-\nroom concept that is decoupled from the outer room using a spring system. The\nwalls are covered in angular, glass-fibre protrusions that absorb echoes,\nallowing for accurate audio testing. I’m told this cost several hundred\nthousand Euros to build, demonstrating Audi’s commitment to the craft of in-\ncar audio.\n\nI also get a tour around Audi’s in-house music studio, which is kitted out\nwith at least €200,000 of high-end speakers. Apparently, the studio – also a\nroom-in-room design – costs even more.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: Audi | The audio reference room at Audi’s Ingolstadt HQ\n\nAudi uses this area to find out what music should really sound like; that’s\nwhy Audi’s sound team call it a “reference room”. Top audio experts at the\ncompany will listen to detailed orchestral music – and even The Eagles’ _Hotel\nCalifornia_ , I learned – to understand exactly how specific instruments sound\nacross audio channels. They’ll test extensively, in stereo, 5.1, and even 3D\nto capture precisely what a song should sound like.\n\nThen, those same soundsters sit in a car – like the new A8, for instance – and\nlisten to the exact same songs again, using the studio experience as a\nreference. By repeating this process over and over, the team is able to tune\nthe speaker systems in the car to sound as close as possible to the original\naudio.\n\n## Kitting out the car is like a ‘Jamie Oliver meal’, apparently\n\nBefore Audi even gets to the tuning stage, the position of the speakers has to\nbe determined.\n\nThis involves working closely with the design team, and realising how the\nsound system will fit with existing concepts for the car.\n\n“We start very early with concepts,” says Wolfram Jähn, Project Manager for\nSound Development on the Audi A8, speaking to _Trusted Reviews_ , “and we make\nsimulations of the loudspeaker in the car. Before the first prototype is\nbuilt, we can say whether it’s a good installation in the car or not.”\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: Audi\n\nAt this stage, Audi will use these computerised simulations to tinker with\nthings like speaker position, radiation, and vibration – as well as choosing\nthe correct loudspeaker. Doing the simulations is important because, as Jähn\npoints out, “if you have any problem, like a woofer in a wrong position, you\ncan’t change it later”.\n\nThen, once the speakers are placed into the vehicle, the tuning begins: “The\ntuning is correcting what you cannot avoid. Reflections, absorptions, wrong\npositions for loudspeakers – so you have to increase the level at certain\nfrequencies.”\n\nThis tuning process takes at least three months for the advanced sound\nsystems, according to Jähn, although it’s quicker for cheaper, more basic\nsystems.\n\n“Then you put everything together,” Jähn tells _Trusted Reviews_. “When Jamie\nOliver is making a meal, and he is buying poor ingredients as a five-star\nchef, he can’t make a good a meal. It’s the same. In the end, it’s a lot of\ntaste. You really have to decide how should the sound system sound.”\n\nHe continues: “It’s very typical for sound systems that there’s not one point\nthat’s the winning thing. The importance for sound systems in cars is it’s a\nchain of elements that have to work together, and then you have a strong\nchain. If you have a weak part, then it will make the whole system weak.”\n\n**Related:[Jaguar E-Pace](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/jaguar-e-pace-\nrelease-date-uk-price-specs-features-top-speed-images-2993596)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: Audi\n\n## Destroying speakers is part of the fun\n\nOne of the key ingredients in Audi’s recipe for great sound is a quality\nroster of loudspeakers. Christian Rückert from Audi’s loudspeaker development\nteam explains how they will go through countless speakers in a bid to find the\nperfect designs for a given car.\n\nTo do this, Audi will conduct various tests, including checking the strength\nand proportions of specific speaker components. Exact benchmarks must be met,\ndue to the demanding nature of a car environment. Audi even has to make sure\nthat its speakers are designed to stay sufficiently cool, to prevent issues\nwith audio.\n\n“The voice coil is wound copper wire,” I’m told. “If it’s getting hotter, the\nresistance is changing, and we get less power from the amplifier. It’s limited\npower.”\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: Audi | Christian Rückert in Audi’s anechoic chamber\n\nHe says temperature can cause even more problems with high-frequencies\nspeakers – so-called “tweeters”: “If you have a tweeter, for example, inside\nis ferrofluid – it’s a magnetic oil. At low temperatures, it’s really hard,\nand at high temperatures, it’s fluid. So it’s changing dramatically the\nperformance of the movement of the voice coil.”\n\nRückert explains that this is one of the key differences between choosing\nspeakers for a home hi-fi system, and selecting car-grade speakers: “One is\nlocated at home at 23 degrees Celcius; here we are located in a car, going\nfrom -40 degrees up to 85 degrees – that’s our working range. So we cannot\nchoose all components identically, but our goal is to have the high-end\nperformance of those speakers in the car.”\n\n“Our goal in development is to push it to the limits. As much as power in the\nend, as possible,” he adds.\n\nThe tests, then, are unsurprisingly rigorous. So rigorous, in fact, that Audi\nregularly ends up breaking speakers simply by pushing them too hard.\n\n“We can destroy the speaker,” Rückert tells _Trusted Reviews_. “In the test\ndepartment, it’s normal. Of course we are breaking the speakers. In the car,\nit should not happen. We have limiters inside, experts for tuning the car and\nthey limit it to a certain level.”\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: Audi\n\n“Using different signals, there are ways to kill every speaker, everywhere,”\nRückert goes on. “You just need to know how. So the worst thing for a\nsubwoofer is to put high-frequency signals. At high frequencies, there is no\nmovement – and movement is important for cooling.”\n\n“You can kill the speaker. If you know how, it’s easy,” he adds, cheerfully.\n\n## The Audi A8 sounds better depending on where you sit\n\nNo system is perfect, and certainly not in the messy acoustic environment of a\ncar. That’s why Audi’s audio systems sound different depending on where you’re\nsitting in the car. The end goal is overall audio accuracy, according to\nproject manager Jähn:\n\n“We really look for clarity, honesty. It must be a system which is not taking\naway something, but not adding something which is not there. Really giving a\npure sound. Nothing more, nothing less.”\n\nUsing the infotainment system (available in both the front and back of the\ncar), it’s possible to drivers and passengers to manually adjust where the\nmusic sounds best in the car. Due to the design of the Audi A8, I’m told the\nbest possible sound is available in the back – that’s thanks to less cluttered\nsurfaces and a more broad acoustic space. But you can shift the quality of the\nsound space around the car simply by using on-board controls, as Jähn\nexplains:\n\n“It’s very difficult for the acoustic to have a good sound in all places. You\nhave to make compromise. Especially in this car, normally the VIP is sitting\nin the back.”\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: Audi\n\nHe also tells me that the A8L – the long-wheelbase version of the car – has\neven better sound than the standard version, simply by virtue of the fact that\nit offers a larger acoustic space to work with.\n\nAlongside the sound location controls, you can also activate a dedicated movie\nmode. This centralises the audio around the centre-console display, which\nmeans it feels “really like a cinema”, according to Jähn. He also says that\nthe sub-woofer in the back is used for a low-frequency effect during movies\n“so when Godzilla comes, you can feel it”.\n\nThe Audi sound team clearly has a passion for great audio, and it’s patently\nobvious that a tremendous amount of work goes into developing in-car sound\nsystems. The nuance of the audio might not match the studio setting, but it’s\nan incredible feat of audio engineering given the tough car environment.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nCredit: Audi\n\nThe process may be laborious, but the end result is thrilling. Fortunately for\nAudi, Jähn tells me it’s pretty easy to work out whether they’ve perfected the\naudio or not:\n\n“When you put the music in [the car] and you’re not starting to shake and it\ndoesn’t touch you emotionally, then we have done something wrong.”\n\n“In the end, the emotion in the music has to be in the car,” he\ncontinues.”Then it’s a good system.”\n\n_The new Audi A8 2017 will be released for UK sale in October, and is expected\nto start from just under £70,000._\n\n**Related:[Kia Sportage review](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/kia-\nsportage)**\n\n**Which of your cars had the best sound system?
