It runs Android Nougat, giving it the versatility it\nneeds to do everything but slob out for you.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n## Why is it interesting?\n\nA lot of devices claim to be adept at multi-tasking, but often they’re a jack\nof all trades and master of none. Remix IO, however, excels in all areas, on\npaper at least.\n\nIt boasts an octa-core processor, which should keep things moving nicely. That\npartners with 2GB of RAM, so it should be able to handle the latest Android\ngames no sweat.\n\n![remix io\nkeyboard](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIt’s equipped for 4K viewing at 60fps, just like the best streaming boxes\naround, and it can run apps from both standard Android and the Android TV OS –\nthey exist side-by-side on the device, as if it was one operating system.\nNeat.\n\n**Related:[The MVR Ascend is a British-made Gear VR\nrival](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/the-mvr-ascend-h1-lets-you-\nplay-gta-5-in-vr-on-ps4-xbox-one-and-pc-immerse-yourself-in-this-week-s-\nfeatured-kickstarter)**\n\nIt also has HDR tech on board, which is something usually reserved for only\nthe cream of the crop when it comes to streaming boxes.\n\nWorried about the fact that Android games are optimised for touch input? Don’t\nworry, you don’t have to get down on your knees and prod your telly. The\nmakers have included a Gaming Toolkit, which lets you custom map your most\nnatural keyboard/mouse and game controller buttons to any Android game.\n\nPlus, it’s a pretty capable Android PC in its own right. It includes both a\nVGA port for older monitors and projectors, and an HDMI for TVs and modern\nmonitors. (Though remember, if you’re using the VGA, you’ll miss out on the 4K\ngoodness.)\n\nIt runs Remix OS, a new operating system based on Android, which allows for\nmultiple user accounts, so everyone in the family can set their own profile.\nIt also gives you multiple windows for multitasking, a task bar, start menu,\nkeyboard and mouse optimisation, and more.\n\nLike we say, a one-stop-shop.\n\n## What are the challenges?\n\n![remix io\nandroid](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nBefore you go chucking money at anything on Kickstarter or Indiegogo, a word\nof warning. Crowdfunding inherently entails risks, as by backing a project,\nyou’re giving the team behind it financial assistance to make their idea a\nreality – not buying a finished a product.\n\nAll being well, you should get your product, it’s just not guaranteed, and nor\nis the delivery timeline, so bear that in mind and consult Kickstarter’s\n[Backer FAQ](https://www.kickstarter.com/help/faq/backer+questions) for more\ninformation.\n\n**Related:[AER lets you lob your GoPro into the\nair](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/aer-lets-you-lob-your-gopro-into-the-\nair-and-is-our-kickstarter-of-the-week)**\n\nThere’s plenty that can go wrong with such a complex product like Remix IO,\nbut the makers say they have a dedicated team just a 30-minute drive away from\nthe manufacturer, so they can deal with any issues in person.\n\nThey also say they’re working with “highly experienced logistics partners” to\nmitigate any issues with shipping.\n\nIf it all goes to plan, it should start shipping in March.\n\n## Is there anything similar available?\n\n![remix io with\nremote](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAdmittedly, you can do pretty much the same thing with any lounge-based PC,\nbut they’re usually hulking great beasts that you wouldn’t want anywhere near\nyour telly.\n\nYou can play games on the [Amazon Fire\nTV](https://www.trustedreviews.com/amazon-fire-tv-review) – it even has its\nown controller – but it can’t double as a PC.\n\n**Related:[We all secretly want a robot butler like Big-i\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/big-i-is-a-robot-butler-for-the-\nhome-and-this-week-s-featured-kickstarter)**\n\nIn other words, no, nothing else offers the same capabilities in such a\ncompact form factor.\n\n## Should I crowdfund this?\n\nIt’s the 21st century. If we want to do different things on our TV, like\nemail, browse the web, stream shows and play games, we shouldn’t have to keep\nswitching from our streaming boxes to our smart TV interfaces, and then\nstopping to hook up a laptop. It should just work.\n\n![remix io\ntv](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIf that sounds like music to your ears, Remix IO could well be for you. The\nearly bird is just $99 (around £80). Considering that’s only a few quid more\nthan an Amazon Fire TV, it sounds like a bargain to us.\n\n## And one to avoid this week…\n\n[Perfect Intimacy HD Dildo Cam](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/perfect-\nintimacy-hd-dildo-cam-camera#/). Yep, it’s a camera you put in the end of a\ndildo, to “capture your life’s most intimate moments”.\n\nWhy would you want to do that? Who knows.\n\nSeeing as the man behind it calls himself “Dick Long Wang,” we assume it’s a\njoke. At least we hope it is.\n\n**WATCH: All you need to know about TVs**\n\n**  \nWhat do you think of Remix IO? Let us know in the comments below.**\n\n"}
