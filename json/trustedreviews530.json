After months of use I\nhaven’t had any serious issues with the phone.\n\nUnlike competing phones, like the [Huawei\nP9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/huawei-p9-review), the HTC 10 remains\nlightning fast. Games open in a matter of seconds and run chug- and stutter-\nfree and I’m yet to have a serious software crash.\n\n**Related:**[ **HTC U11: This HTC’s next flagship**  \n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/htc-11-release-date-specs-2017-price-uk-\nnews-rumours)  \nThe phone has also survived more than average wear and tear. As well as\nseveral standard accidental drops onto _TrustedReviews’_ carpeted floor, the\nphone also survived a hazardous impact with a tree after an accidental trip\nwhile running. It remained crack and chip free.\n\nBattery life has slightly deteriorated, but not as much as I’d expected. The\nHTC 10 still easily lasts a full day off one charge and I regularly manage to\neek out two days with light use.\n\nThe camera is still a slight annoyance, but only because I’ve experienced the\nmajestic awesomeness of the [Galaxy\nS7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-s7-review) – which still has\nthe best phone camera sensor on the market.\n\nThe HTC 10’s camera isn’t bad, but the use of Ultrapixel tech, which instructs\nthe camera to capture bigger pixels and more light, works a little too well.\nPhotos taken in even moderately bright lighting conditions are regularly\nwashed out and have unwanted flare effects. Careful use can get around the\nissue, however, and I’m still more than happy to snap memento shots of meetups\nwith friends.\n\nHowever, the phone’s biggest selling point remains its advanced audio\nqualities. HTC’s been leading the mobile audio market for quite some time and\nthe 10 cements its position as the best phone maker for music fans.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nPutting aside the phone’s Boomsound speakers that, while above average, are\nonly useful to cretins that insist on using their phone to listen to music\noutloud, the HTC 10’s standalone headphone amp is its best feature.\n\nThe HTC 10 uses a dedicated DAC as well as headphone amp. HTC claims the 10’s\namp is twice as powerful as competing phones, and after a few months with the\nphone I believe it. The HTC 10 consistently delivers superior audio quality to\ncompeting phones, including the Galaxy S7, LG G5 (without its add on DAC),\nOnePlus 3 and Huawei P9 on a variety of genres.\n\nEverything from heavy metal, punk, prog and jazz sounds fuller and better\nbalanced on the HTC 10 and it’s a key reason the 10 remains my handset of\nchoice, even though it falls behind its archrival, the Galaxy S7, in other\nareas.\n\n**Buy Now:[HTC U11 on O2 (2GB) – £59.99 upfront,\n£34/month](http://www.awin1.com/pclick.php?p=13928137733&a=277673&m=2264&clickref=tr-\nmobiledeals)**  \n**Buy Now:[HTC U11 on EE (5GB) – £0 upfront,\n£37.99/month](http://www.awin1.com/pclick.php?p=10671366431&a=277673&m=3202&clickref=tr-\nmobiledeals)**  \n**Buy Now:[HTC U11 on EE (8GB) – £139 upfront,\n£37.99/month](http://www.awin1.com/pclick.php?p=8529115601&a=277673&m=380&clickref=tr-\nmobiledeals)**\n\n**Related:[Best HTC U11 deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/best-\nhtc-u11-deals-1)**\n\n_**Continue reading for our full HTC 10 review  \n**_\n\n## What is the HTC 10?\n\nAfter the frankly awful HTC One M9, the Taiwanese brand went back to the\ndrawing board and, well, it worked. The HTC 10 more than matches up to the[\niPhone 6S](https://www.trustedreviews.com/iphone-6s-review) in looks, and it\ndoesn’t fall behind the Samsung Galaxy S7 when it comes to specs.\n\nWith its sloping curves, aluminium body and clean front, the HTC 10 is one of\nthe best looking phones on the market, but with the [iPhone\n7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-7-release-date-price-rumours-\nvideo-images-features-uk) and [Samsung Galaxy Note\n7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-galaxy-note-7-review) coming soon is\nit still worth buying?\n\n**Video: Watch our HTC 10 video review**\n\n## HTC 10 – Design\n\nWhile the HTC 10 takes the brand’s flagship smartphone in a new design\ndirection, it’s still very familiar. The front is stripped from the One A9,\nand the back is a tweaked and tuned version of the rear casing from the [One\nM9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/htc-one-m9-review).\n\nIt’s far from original and looking at it face-on you’d be forgiven for\nconfusing it with an iPhone or Samsung Galaxy S7, but for me it’s the perfect\nmix of style and substance.\n\nFirst off, this phone is clearly made from metal – and proud of it. The back\nis cool to the touch, with an elegant curve that helps it sit comfortably in\nyour hand. This curve flows into some heavily chamfered edges that add a bit\nof much-needed flair.\n\nIt’s a divisive design choice, though. I really like them as they give your\nfingers somewhere to sit, but the some of the _TrustedReviews_ team were less\nimpressed, claiming they’re far too shiny.\n\n**Related:[HTC 10 vs Samsung Galaxy\nS7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/htc-10-vs-galaxy-s7)**  \n![front](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe camera sensor sits bang in the centre, and while it doesn’t have what I’d\nconsider a ‘hump’, it does jut out ever so slightly. Alongside it is an LED\nflash and a space for the laser autofocus system.\n\nLike any metal phone, the sleek design is broken up by two bands of antenna\nlines that run around the top and bottom. These don’t stand out anywhere near\nas much as they do on the iPhone and they feel like part of the design, rather\nthan something that has to be there.\n\nAlong the side you’ve got the usual combination of a volume rocker and\nsleep/wake button, the latter of which is bevelled and easily identifiable\neven when the phone is in your pocket.\n\nMost other phones have switched to a single tray that houses both the Nano SIM\ntray and a microSD card, but the HTC 10 still has one tray on each side. I’d\nlike to see this combined to makes things sleeker, but it makes little\ndifference in reality.\n\n**Related:[Best smartphone](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-\nsmartphone_round-up)**  \n![htc10 7](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nFlip the phone over and the HTC 10 is one of the cleanest devices around. HTC\nhas even removed its brand logo – a minimal change that makes a big\ndifference.\n\nCompared to last year’s One M9 flagship, there are a couple of major\ndifferences here.\n\nThere’s now a capacitive home key sitting below the display that isn’t so much\nof a button but a touchpad. Like pretty much every worthwhile Android phone\nthis year it features a fingerprint scanner inside, but coming from the Galaxy\nS7 it feels strange not to get get that satisfying ‘click’ when I press down.\n\nHTC has also switched to capacitive Back and Recent Apps keys, as opposed to\non-screen versions, and these sit either side of the home button. It’s all\ndown to personal preference whether you prefer physical or virtual buttons,\nbut it does free up that extra bit of screen real estate.\n\n![htc10 5](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)_The phone comes in black, silver and gold_\n\nWhereas LG took plenty of risks with its funky modular design of the G5, HTC\nhas played it relatively safe here. That’s not a dig, though. In fact I’d say\nthe HTC 10 is my favourite phone of the year so far when it comes to the\noverall look and feel.\n\nIt almost matches the Galaxy S7 for size, though it’s marginally taller and\nnoticeably weightier. It feels reassuringly expensive and solid, which is\nsomething I just can’t say about the LG G5.\n\nIt’s the precision, though, that wins it for HTC. Everything is symmetrical,\nwith the headphone jack, camera sensor and USB-C port on the bottom, all in\nline with each other. I would have preferred to see that headphone port on the\nbottom, but that’s just a minor quibble.\n\nConsidering its history, it’s no surprise that HTC has designed a stunning\nlooking phone. It hasn’t taken risks and opted for something more ‘out there’,\nbut it still has charm and is an absolute pleasure to use.\n\n## HTC 10 – Screen\n\nHTC has updated just about every part of the One M9 for its successor, and the\ndisplay is no exception.\n\nIt’s grown slightly to 5.2-inches, but the bigger upgrade is the resolution.\nIt’s much more pixel dense now, thanks to the 2560 x 1440 quad-HD resolution,\nand it covers 99.9% of the sRGB colour gamut. It’s a mightily impressive\npanel, though as it’s LCD – 5th-generation LCD, to be precise – it does lack a\nlittle of the vibrancy of Samsung’s Super AMOLED screen. It’s not far off, and\nit’s hard to notice unless you have both phones sat next to each other.\n\n**Related:[HTC 10 vs iPhone\n6S](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/htc-10-vs-iphone-6s)**  \n![htc10\n31](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nIt’s a lovely display to look at. Colours are punchy and bright, without being\noversaturated, and they’re accurate too. The wide colour gamut is great for\nwatching video as it was originally intended and accurately editing snaps,\nmaking this a strong media machine.\n\nThere is a slight pinkish tinge to the display when it’s tilted to the side\nand this dampens viewing angles, but it’s not a deal-breaker. Viewing angles\nare still great and reflections are kept to a minimum, but colours are skewed\never so slightly when you’re not looking directly at it. I had a similar issue\nwith the [Galaxy S7 Edge](https://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-\ngalaxy-s7-edge-review), so it’s certainly not a problem exclusive to HTC’s\ndisplays.\n\nThe HTC 10 is missing a feature both the LG G5 and Galaxy S7 tout, which is an\nAlways-On mode. This clever method of displaying your most recent\nnotifications when the display is seemingly off is far from essential, but\nit’s a useful extra that I’ve grown to like after using those two phones. LG\nmanaged it with an LCD screen, so I’m not sure why HTC hasn’t tried anything\nsimilar.\n\nWhat it does offer over its rivals is improved brightness. Well, in certain\nsituations. In regular use, the maximum brightness on the HTC 10 is much\nbrighter than that of the LG G5 and Galaxy S7, though it doesn’t feature the\ntrick used by those two where it can boost brightness even more in direct\nsunlight. Still, the HTC 10 is perfectly usable outdoors.\n\n[ Next  \nPerformance, Audio and Software\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/htc-10-performance-audio-and-\nsoftware-page-2)\n\n"}
