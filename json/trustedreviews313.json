Confused about the difference between\nIncense and Lure Modules? **  \n**  \nWell worry no more, Pokémon beginner, we’ll have you up to speed in no time at\nall with our guide to the basics of Pokémon Go.\n\n**Related:[How to play Pokemon Go – Tips and tricks to become a\nmaster](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/how-to-play-pokemon-go-tips-\ntricks-guide)**\n\n## PokéStops\n\nTo start levelling up and gaining experience points, you’ll need to start\namassing not only Pokémon, but also items to help build and strengthen your\nteam. You can collect items – more on those later – from PokéStops. These are\nthe 3D blue diamonds on your map and represent free supply stores from where\nyou collect all the necessary items to help your roster of fledgling Pokémon\nalong.\n\n## Incense and Lure Modules\n\nYou’ll want to start attracting more Pokémon so you can catch them and amass a\nlarger team. When you begin the game, you’re given two Incense pots to get\ngoing. Activate them to emit a fragrance that will have the little creatures\ndrawn to you like bees to honey.\n\n**Related:[How to battle in Pokémon\nGo](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/how-to-win-battle-pokemon-go-\nbattling-training-fighting-gym-guide)**\n\n![Pokemon Go\nlure](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n###  How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nWhile Incense pots allow only you to attract Pokémon, Lure Modules work for\nevery single trainer in the vicinity and can be used on PokéStops. The stop\nwill then start producing pink petals to let you know it’s a hotspot for\nPokémon.\n\n## Pokéballs\n\nSo, now to catch your Pokémon. To do that, you’ll need Pokéballs. These can be\ncollected from PokéStops or bought with the game’s currency: Pokécoins. Try\nspinning the ball before you throw to add to its effectiveness.\n\n## Factions\n\nThere are three factions, or teams, that Professor Willow will ask you to join\nonce you enter a gym – see below – for the first time. Which team you join\nwill depend on which names or colours you prefer, since no team is better than\nthe other. You can pick from Team Mystic (blue) Team Valor (red) and Team\nInstinct (yellow).\n\n## Gyms\n\nGyms are marked by large towers on your map and are typically associated with\nlandmarks or points of interest. Once you reach level five, you can start\nbattling for control of gyms.\n\n**Related:[7 bizarre places Pokemon have been spotted in Pokemon\nGo](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/pokemon-go-launch-7-bizarre-\nplaces-android-ios)**\n\n![Pokemon Go\nGym](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nGyms are important because this is where the battles take place. You and your\nteam will aim to capture gyms by defeating other teams. Gyms that aren’t owned\nalready show up grey on your map. Place your Pokémon here and the gym is\nyours. When a gym is already occupied, it will show up with the team’s colour.\nYou can challenge ownership by battling its occupants.\n\nThis is where building a balanced team helps. For example, Pokémon with water\nstrength are good lined up against Pokémon with fire strength. Conversely,\nfire outmuscles grass and so on – it’s like a game of rock, paper, scissors.\n\nRule the gyms and you rule the game – simple.\n\n## Potions, Super Potions and Revives\n\nAfter a hard battle, your Pokémon will need recovery before the next\nchallenge. Applying potions can heal wounds; super potions heal them quicker.\nRevive is a medicine that completely restores a Pokémon that has fainted due\nto defeat or distress from a taxing battle.\n\n## Candy and Stardust\n\nCandy and Stardust help evolve your Pokémon into fighting superstars. Again,\nthese are among the items that can be collected from PokéStops. In addition,\nyou can give Pokémon back to the professor who will hand over candy in\nexchange.\n\nUpgrading your Pokémon is important as you progress through the game. Candy is\nspecific to the Pokémon you apply it to, whereas Stardust can be used on\nanything.\n\n## Eggs\n\nEggs can hatch Pokémon and also add XP and stardust to your arsenal. You can\nhatch them by walking around – so the more you play, the more you’ll gain.\n\n**Related:[ Best Android Apps](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best-android-\napps_round-up)**\n\n![Pokemon Go Lucky\nEgg](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nAnd don’t think you can cheat by driving. The system gives you credit only for\ntravelling under 20mph, so cycling and skateboarding are the only things\nyou’ll get away with.\n\n## Razzberries\n\nThese are the fruit you can use to try to make hard-to-catch Pokémon easier to\nnab. Throw one out during a capture scenario and you should be able to bring\nthe insolent little critter around. Once you’ve gained their trust, it will\nmake catching them far easier.\n\n## Footprints\n\nFinally, the “Nearby” guide in the bottom-right of your screen is a useful\ntool. Each Pokémon on the list will have footprints below them. These little\nsteps mean you can track the Pokémon you may be lacking in your lineup. You\ncan then purposefully navigate to the ones you need. Zero steps: they’re right\non top of you; three, and you’ve got further to go.\n\n![Pokemon Go\nNearby](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSimply circle the one you want and don’t close the grid. The closer it gets to\nthe top left, the closer you are. If it drops a place, you’re walking in the\nwrong direction. It’s a little like that “warmer, colder” game you played as a\nkid.\n\nGenerally speaking, you don’t have to go that far. Just make sure that you’\nhave the best weapons in your holster to capture that rare and powerful\nPokémon.\n\n**Watch: What is Pokemon Go?**\n\nGot any other tips we should include?
