Much of that fresh DNA\nhas been implanted straight into the Mate 20 Pro (and more modest [Mate\n20](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/huawei-mate-20)) as well.\n\n![Huawei P20 Pro in late 2018\nfinishes](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe latest colourways and finishes of the Huawei P20 Pro\n\nBoth Pros feature extended aspect ratio displays with the bezels being notably\nslimmer on the newer Mate, not least because of the removal of a fingerprint\nsensor, or at least a visible one. Championed by last year’s specialist\n[Huawei Mate RS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/huawei-mate-rs-\nporsche-design), the new Mate 20 Pro is the first mass-market smartphone to\nsport an in-display fingerprint sensor and initial testing is promising. It\ndoesn’t feel quite as fast as the sensor beneath the P20 Pro’s display, but it\nmakes for a more seamless design overall.\n\nBoth phones feature IP-certified dust and water resistance, although the newer\nMate 20 Pro is marginally hardier (IP68 versus IP67, as on the P20 Pro) and\nboth also forego a traditional headphone jack, which might irk some users. At\nleast Huawei includes a USB-C-to-3.5mm adaptor in-box with the P20 Pro; the\nsame can’t be said for the Mate.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\n![Huawei Mate 20\nPro](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThe Mate 20 Pro is unmistakably related to the P20 Pro.\n\nFlip both phones over and you’ll find some eye-catching finishes awaiting you.\nThe P20 Pro was the first of the company’s phones to debut punchy new glass\nfinishes like Twilight and Pink Gold, with new leather-backed special editions\narriving more recently. The Mate 20 Pro pulls the same trick with graduated\nglass backs in a wider assortment of colours, some of which also debut an all-\nnew ‘hyper optical’ hairline pattern that improves grip too.\n\n**Related:[Best Phablets](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nphablet-3500572)**\n\nBoth phones rock a triple camera array on their backs, although the Mate 20\nmakes its camera setup more of a feature, setting them within a rounded square\nin the centre of the phone’s back. Whether this is a design improvement is\nhard to say, but it certainly helps the Mate 20 Pro stand out from the crowd\nof other glass-backed rivals out there.\n\n## Mate 20 Pro vs P20 Pro: How do their specs and features differ?\n\nEven though both phones follow similar principles, everything has been amped\nup on the Mate 20 Pro.\n\nThe P20 Pro uses Huawei’s late-2017 flagship processor, the Kirin 970, while\nthe new 7nm Kirin 980 makes its debut on the Mate 20 Pro, promising up to a\n20% speed improvement and a 40% improvement in power efficiency over the older\nchip. Both phones also come with 6GB of RAM, so they’re well-equipped for\ndemanding multitasking and the like.\n\nThe special edition leather-backed P20 Pro does offer a little extra oomph\nwith a whopping 8GB of RAM, but it’ll likely still fall short of the Kirin\n980’s advanced efficiency.\n\n| **P20 Pro** | **Mate 20 Pro**  \n---|---|---  \n**Dimensions** |  155 x 73.9 x 7.8 mm | 157.8 x 72.3 x 8.6mm  \n**Weight** |  180 grams | 189 grams  \n**Display** |  6.1-inch OLED, 18.7:9 ratio, DCI-P3, HDR, Full HD+ (2240 x\n1080) display | 6.39-inch curved OLED,  \n19.5:9, DCI-P3, HDR,  \nWQHD+ (3120 x 1440) display  \n**Processor** |  Kirin 970 | Kirin 980  \n**RAM** |  6GB/8GB | 6GB  \n**Rear camera** |  40 + 20 (mono) + 8-megapixel triple camera | 40 + 20 (RGB)\n+ 8-megapixel triple camera  \n**Front camera** |  24-megapixel | 24-megapixel w/ depth sensing face unlock  \n**Battery** |  4000mAh | 4200mAh  \n**Software** |  Android 8.1 Oreo w/ EMUI 8.1 | Android 9.0 Pie w/ EMUI 9  \n**Storage** |  128GB/256GB.

Sadly, aside from greater\npeace of mind over the P20 Pro’s tech, the additional effort Huawei has made\nhere doesn’t grant the Mate 20 Pro the ability to authorise sensitive actions\nlike purchases or let you log into banking apps using the sensor. Such\nfunctionality will only come about if developers make use of the sensor’s\nspecific APIs, and right now, that seems unlikely.\n\nThere’s a whopping 4000mAh battery inside the P20 Pro. It offers some of the\nbest battery life of any flagship currently on the market and what’s more, it\nfeatures respectably rapid 22.5W [fast\ncharging](https://www.trustedreviews.com/how-to/what-is-fast-\ncharging-3521693). Like so many aspects of the Mate 20 Pro, it takes all of\nthese great aspects from the P20 Pro and improves upon them.\n\nNot only does the phone sport a larger 4200mAh power pack, but it’s also the\nfirst of the company’s phones to debut even more rapid 40W SuperCharge fast\ncharging and it’s the first of Huawei’s phones to integrate wireless charging.\nThe company didn’t skip either, granting the Mate 15W fast wireless charging\nand, in an industry first, wireless reverse charging – letting you juice\nanother Qi-enabled smartphone (such as an [iPhone\nXS](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-xs) or [Samsung Galaxy\nS9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9)) wire-free.\n\n**Related:[Best Wireless Charger](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nwireless-charger-3505891)**\n\nBoth phones’ primary triple camera arrays might sound the same on paper but\nHuawei has switched things up with its newer phone. While the resolution\nremains unchanged, the company is now confident that its new Matrix Camera\nsystem takes good enough shots that it can do away with the secondary\nmonochrome sensor used by the likes of the P20 Pro. Instead, the Mate 20 Pro\nbenefits from an ultra-wide angle 20-megapixel secondary RGB sensor that lets\nyou capture even wider shots and take macro images as close as 2.5cms from\nyour subject.\n\nWhat’s more, the beefier processor lets you capture markedly smoother 4K video\nat 30 frames per second, along with new filtered shooting modes that add real-\ntime effects to footage such as colour pop.\n\n**Related:[Best Phones](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nsmartphone-3431175)**\n\n## Mate 20 Pro vs P20 Pro: How much more expensive is the new Huawei?\n\nThe Huawei P20 Pro may have only been out five months but its flagship price\nhas already fallen to a more approachable €640/£669. The newly unveiled Huawei\nMate 20 Pro is slated to hit the market on October 16 costing considerably\nmore, at €1049.\n\n**Do the Mate 20 Pro’s additional features justify the added cost over the P20\nPro?
