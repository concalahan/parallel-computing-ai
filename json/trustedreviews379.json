If you’re rocking a [Google\nPixel](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel) or recent Nexus\ndevice then you can taste that Oreo right now, but if you’re one of the many\nAndroid users that aren’t then you might be in for a long wait.\n\n## Essential Phone Android 8.0 update\n\nEssential is the new kid on the block when it comes to Android phones, and we\nhaven’t even seen the bezel-free phone in the UK yet. But, it seems that it’s\nabout to get the Android Oreo update.\n\n**Related:[Not interested in Android?

Considering they’re the phones made to\nbe adverts for the latest versions of Android, it’s hardly a surprise Google’s\nown Pixel and Nexus handsets get a quick update.\n\nAndroid 8.0 Oreo is rolling out to Pixel, Pixel XL, [Pixel\nC](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-c), [Nexus\n6P](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nexus-6p) and [Nexus\n5X](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nexus-5x) owners in the coming\nweeks and factory images and OTA links are available right now on the Android\nDevelopers website.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Google Home Hub YouTube](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Will Google Home Hub ever get Netflix?

Stay tuned for more Oreo details & new products!\n[pic.twitter.com/B2Os1tOONP](https://t.co/B2Os1tOONP)\n\n>\n\n> — HTC USA (@HTCUSA) [August 24,\n2017](https://twitter.com/HTCUSA/status/900794911045242880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nHTC has already announced that its 2017 flagship, the [HTC\nU11](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/htc-U-11), will be getting a taste\nof Oreo before we welcome in 2018. In a tweet sent from the official HTC USA\naccount, the Taiwanese brand also said that Android 8.0 is coming to the [HTC\nU Ultra](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/htc-u-ultra) and last year’s\n[HTC 10](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/htc-10).\n\nQ4 is the only timeframe given, but hopefully these updates will start rolling\nout before the festive season hits.\n\n**Related:[Samsung Galaxy S8 vs iPhone\n8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-8-vs-samsung-\ngalaxy-s8-3286367)**\n\n![HTC U11 vs HTC\n10](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThings are a bit murkier for non-flagship, and older, HTC devices but we’ll\nupdate this list when we know more.\n\n## Samsung Android 8.0 update\n\nSamsung isn’t historically known for getting Android updates out quickly, but\nthere are some rumours that might change with Android Oreo. There has been\nrumblings that Samsung is already working on an update to its two best phones\nof the year – the [Samsung Galaxy\nS8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s8) and S8 Plus.\n\n**Related:[Samsung Galaxy Note 8\nreview](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-8)**\n\nThough, until we receive something official from the Korean company we won’t\nknow for sure when we’ll see Android 8.0 Oreo.\n\n## Sony Android 8.0 update\n\nSony might be lagging behind the competition with the actual phones it\nproduces, but it is looking to be one of the top performers when it comes to\nquickly getting Oreo out to devices.\n\nThe [Sony Xperia XZ1](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sony-xperia-xz1)\nand [XZ1 Compact](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sony-xperia-\nxz1-compact), both announced at IFA 2017, will come with Oreo installed when\nthey start shipping later in September.\n\nIt’s not just flagship Xperia devices that will getting Oreo, in fact a whole\nload of Sony phones are set to be upgraded.\n\nHere is the complete list:\n\n  * [Sony Xperia X](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sony-xperia-x)\n  * Sony Xperia X Performance\n  * [Sony Xperia XZ](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sony-xperia-xz)\n  * Sony Xperia X Compact\n  * [Sony Xperia XZ Premium](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sony-xperia-xz-premium)\n  * [Sony Xperia XA1](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sony-xperia-xa1)\n  * Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra\n  * Sony Xperia XZs\n\nWe don’t yet know when these updates will start hitting devices.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n## Huawei Android 8.0 update\n\nHuawei tends to release a phone early in the year and then another towards the\nend. This year we’re expecting the [Huawei\nP10](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/huawei-p10) to be joined by the\nMate 10 in October.\n\nIn previous years the Mate series has shipped with the latest update onboard;\nthe [Mate 8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/huawei-mate-8) came with\nthe [Marshmallow](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/android-marshmallow),\nwhile the [Mate 9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/huawei-mate-9)\nshipped with Nougat. If the pattern continues, hopefully the Mate 10 will ship\nwith Oreo already installed.\n\nWe’re not sure when, or if, the other Huawei devices will receive the update.\n\nThe brand-new [Huawei Mate 10](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/huawei-\nmate-10) and 10 Pro both ship with Android Oreo, so at least we know Huawei\nhas a stable build ready.\n\n## LG Android 8.0 update\n\nLG kicked off the 2017 trend of slimming down thick bezel with the [LG\nG6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/lg-g6), and followed it up with\nwhat looks to be a fantastic phone in the form of the [LG\nV30](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/lg-v30).\n\nBut unlike the LG V20, which shipped with Android 7.0 Nougat, the V30 won’t be\nrunning the latest version of Android when it’s plucked from store shelves.\n\n**Related:[LG V30 vs Samsung Galaxy\nS8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-v30-vs-galaxy-s8-3275821)**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nWe haven’t yet had any concrete information on when LG’s phones will be\nreceiving Oreo, but we’ll update this page when we know more. ****\n\n##  Motorola Android 8.0 update\n\nOnce renowned for its snappy updates, Motorola hasn’t been quite so consistent\nin recent times. Thankfully, we have already got confirmation from Motorola\nthat certain devices will be seeing Oreo soon.\n\n  * Moto Z2 Force \n  * [Moto Z2 Play](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/moto-z2-play)\n  * Moto Z Force \n  * [Moto Z](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/moto-z)\n  * Moto Z Play\n  * [Moto G5S Plus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/moto-g5s-plus)\n  * [Moto G5 Plus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/moto-g5-plus)\n  * [Moto G5](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/motorola-moto-g)\n\nThat covers all the main 2017 devices from Moto, aside from the Moto E4, but\nit is missing the notable older devices from 2016. The Moto G4, G4 Plus and\nMoto G4 Play are all absent from the list which is something of a\ndisappointment.\n\nThere’s also no mention of an update for the recently announced [Moto\nX4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/moto-x4), though could simply be\nbecause it’s not even out yet.\n\n## OnePlus Android 8.0 update\n\nThe OnePlus 5 is one of our very favourite Android phones of 2017, and it’s\nthe best device from the growing Chinese upstarts yet.\n\nA lot of what makes the [OnePlus\n5](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/oneplus-5) so great is the lack of\nneedless extras in its software, which is very similar to stock Android you’d\nfind on a Pixel phone.\n\nIt seems that OnePlus is already in the process of testing out its Oreo\nupdate, with some [OnePlus\n3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/oneplus-3) users already receiving\nthe update through a special closed beta programme. We’d expect this beta to\nbe expanded to other users before the update goes live for all.\n\n**Related:[OnePlus 5 vs iPhone\n7](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/oneplus-5-vs-iphone-7-2952355)**\n\n![ONEPLUS\n5](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\n##  Nokia Android 8.0 update\n\n2017 has been a huge year for the Nokia brand, and its owners HMD. Along with\nresurrecting the iconic 3310 in slightly shonky fashion, it has produced a\nbunch of pretty decent Android phones. The [Nokia\n3](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nokia-3), [Nokia\n5](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nokia-5) and [Nokia\n6](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/nokia-6) hit shelves earlier in the\nyear and have all been confirmed to be getting the Oreo update at some point.\n\n> We are on it\n[@nokiamobile](https://twitter.com/nokiamobile?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) .\n[@Android](https://twitter.com/Android?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n[#Oreo](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Oreo?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\nmaturing nicely on\n[#Nokia8](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Nokia8?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) ,\nwill release when perfect.
