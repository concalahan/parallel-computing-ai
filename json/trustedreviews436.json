It was among the first to adopt an elongated display\nwith the [Galaxy S8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-\ngalaxy-s8), and it’s also one of the few to have made the transition without\nsuccumbing to the much-maligned notch.\n\nWith this in mind, we’ve placed the shiny new Galaxy Note 9 phablet against\none of Samsung’s best big-screened phones of 2017: the Galaxy S8 Plus.\n\n## Samsung Galaxy Note 9 vs Galaxy S8 Plus – Worth the upgrade?\n\nThe S8 Plus and last year’s [Samsung Galaxy Note\n8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-8) butted up\nagainst one another far more than the smaller S8 ever did. With only 0.1\ninches of screen between them, both doled out a great media experience, not\nleast because Samsung was among the first to add HDR support to its mobile\nlineup.\n\n**Related:[Samsung Galaxy Note 9 vs Galaxy Note\n8](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-9-vs-\nnote-8-3526974)**\n\nBoth panels also delivered impressively crisp imagery thanks to the WQHD+\nresolution at play, not to mention the fact that Samsung favours richer AMOLED\npanels too.\n\nWe may be 18 months down the line, but the story is much the same. The Note 9\nretains its predecessor’s defining S Pen functionality (albeit with a few new\nabilities) and sports a bigger battery, which has the potential to take you\nbeyond a day and a half of use.\n\nA new pair of chipsets (depending on the market in which you buy the Note 9)\nalso adds oomph beyond the Exynos 8895/Snapdragon 835-powered S8 Plus is\ncapable. And a new GPU in the Note 9 should deliver better mobile gaming, too.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: Photo by Raúl Nájera on Unsplash \n\n### How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the answer\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/alexa-vote-us-mid-term-\nelections-2018-3613635 \"How to vote in the US midterms 2018: Alexa has the\nanswer\")\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  *   * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  * \n\nAs for memory and storage, the Note 9 comes with 6GB or 8GB (depending on the\nstorage option), whilst some variants of the S8 Plus fall comparatively short\nwith 4GB. This has the potential to hinder multi-tasking and frequent app-\nswitching.\n\nThe other big difference between the majority of Samsung’s 2017 flagships and\nits 2018 devices – including the new Note 9 – is the newer phones’ dual rear\ncamera setup.\n\nThe 12-megapixel single sensor on the rear of the S8 Plus is still undeniably\nexcellent. However, Samsung’s camera technicians never rest on their laurels,\ngracing the Note 9 with a souped-up mix of the dual 12-megapixel setup first\nencountered on the Note 8 with the dual aperture magic that debuted on the S9.\nAlbeit, this time with a fingerprint sensor in a more convenient position –\nanother trait lacking in the S8 Plus.\n\n**Related:[Samsung Galaxy Note 9 vs Galaxy\nS9](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-9-vs-\ngalaxy-s9-3527010)**\n\n## Samsung Galaxy Note 9 vs Galaxy S8 Plus – Specs\n\nHere’s a rundown of some of the fundamentals at play within both the new\nGalaxy Note 9 and Samsung’s Galaxy S8 Plus:\n\n**Price** £899/£1099£699 (64GB)\n\n| **Galaxy Note 9** | **Galaxy S8 Plus**  \n---|---|---  \n**Display** |  6.4 inches,  \n1440 x 2960, AMOLED | 6.2 inches, 1440 x 2960, AMOLED  \n**Processor** |  Exynos 9810/Snapdragon 845 | Exynos 8895/Snapdragon 835  \n**RAM** |  6GB/8GB | 4GB/6GB  \n**Rear camera** |  Dual 12-megapixel | Single 12-megapixel  \n**Front camera** |  8-megapixel | 8-megapixel  \n**Battery** |  4000mAh | 3500mAh  \n**Software** |  Android 8.1 Oreo | Android 8.0 Oreo  \n**Storage** |  128/512GB + microSD up to 512GB | 64/128GB w/ microSD up to\n512GB  \n**Stylus** |  S Pen w/ Bluetooth | None  \n  \n## Samsung Galaxy Note 9 vs Galaxy S8 Plus – Design and software\n\nThe Note series has always sported a more square appearance than the\ncurvacious Galaxy S line, and the same is true here. The Note 9, like the S8\nPlus, is a sandwich of curved Gorilla Glass on the front and back, with a\nmetal frame running around the phone’s edge.\n\nThe rounding of the corners on the Note’s body and display are both\nsignificantly smaller than the S8 Plus’ silhouette – which, if it’s anything\nlike the Note 8, will make it a touch less ergonomic.\n\nSamsung now colour-matches the glass and metalwork on 2018’s Note, while the\nS8 Plus comes in all-black or a silver frame when paired with any other\ncolourway. The predominantly glass design does at least facilitate both\nphone’s wireless and fast-charging support, which has now become a staple of\nSamsung’s flagship devices.\n\nAs for the software experience, both phones sport heavily skinned but\nrelatively slick variations on Android, dubbed the Samsung Experience. Running\natop 8.0 Oreo (with an update to 8.1 Oreo slated for later in August) on the\nS8 Plus and Android 8.1 Oreo at launch on the Note 9, with a presumed update\nto [Android 9.0 Pie](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/android-pie)\nsometime next spring, the Samsung Experience 9.0 is decidedly similar on both\nphones.\n\n**Related:[Samsung Galaxy Note 9 vs iPhone\nX](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-9-vs-\niphone-x-3527113)**\n\nThere’s native support for multi-tasking, Bixby is unfortunately just a\nbutton-press or a swipe away, and Samsung’s pre-loaded software – such as its\nThemes app, Health app and Edge Screen – are all present and correct on both.\n\nBeing a Note rather than a Galaxy S device, Samsung also throws in a few\nstylus-driven experiences on the Note 9. These include Samsung Notes, the\nPENUP illustrative social network and Air Command, which lets you take\nsnippets, draw animated live messages and use the S Pen to request real-time\ntext translation.\n\n## Samsung Galaxy Note 9 vs Galaxy S8 Plus price – Which is better value?\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Note 9 is the company’s productivity-driven flagship for\n2018, whereas the Galaxy S line has always had a proclivity for entertainment.\nLast year’s S8 Plus will continue to deliver a sterling smartphone experience\nand is still receiving major Android updates from Samsung, so should remain\nrelevant for at least another year. The Note 9, meanwhile, is essentially the\nbest of Samsung’s best right now and, as such, comes with a price tag to\nmatch, starting at £899.\n\n* * *\n\n## Note 9 Pre-order contracts\n\n**Sky Mobile** – 2GB of data: [Galaxy Note 9 128GB – no upfront,\n£42/month](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=11005&clickref=tr-\nnote9&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sky.com%2Fshop%2Fmobile)\n\n**Three** – 4GB of data: [Galaxy Note 9 128GB – £79 upfront,\n£48/month](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=10210&clickref=tr-\nnote9&p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.three.co.uk%2F)\n\n**EE** – 8GB of data: [Galaxy Note 9 128GB – £150 upfront,\n£48/month](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=380&clickref=tr-\nnote9&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fsamsung-galaxy-note-9-128GB-\nmidnight-black%3Ftariffcode%3DBG4YMFEB18)\n\n**Vodafone** – 40GB of data: [Galaxy Note 9 128GB – £66 upfront,\n£49/month](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=1257&clickref=tr-\nnote9&p=http%3A%2F%2Fshop.vodafone.co.uk%2Fshop%2Fcontracts-and-\ndeals%2Fsamsung-galaxy-note-9%2Fsku94702)\n\n**Virgin Mobile** – 5GB of data, 1000 minutes, unlimited texts: [Galaxy Note 9\n128GB – no upfront,\n£55.50/month](http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=277673&awinmid=6399&clickref=tr-\nnote9&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.virginmedia.com%2Fmobile%2Fpay-\nmonthly%2Fsamsung%2Fgalaxy-\nnote-9%2F%3FcontractDuration%3D24%26tariffID%3D1174810128)\n\n**EE** – 30GB of data: [Galaxy Note 9 128GB – £59.99 upfront,\n£68/month](https://www.carphonewarehouse.com/mobiles/pay-monthly-\ntariff.html#!/sort/relevance/model/SAMNOTE9128BLA)\n\n* * *\n\n## Early verdict\n\nIf you want the S Pen functionality, better battery life, an even larger\ndisplay and a more versatile camera, then the Note 9 is the way to go – but\nyou’ll pay through the nose for it at launch.\n\nThe S8 Plus will continue to serve you well for media and gaming on a big-\nscreened phone, and it’s dropped in price considerably. If you’re still\nhankering for stylus input, the Note 8 has also seen a reduction in price and\nwill likely drop further, faster once the phone hits stores.\n\n**Related:[Samsung Galaxy Note 9 vs Galaxy S9\nPlus](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-9-vs-\ngalaxy-s9-plus-3525284)**\n\n"}
