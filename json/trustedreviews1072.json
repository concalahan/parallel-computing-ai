Arriving on PC also brought a wave\nof [GTA 5 mods](https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/best-\ngta-5-mods-2925928). This popularity inevitably means there are huge\nexpectations for its sequel, something fans are desperate to see in the coming\nyears.\n\nHowever, with [Red Dead Redemption 2](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/red-\ndead-redemption-2-release-date-news-rumours-and-trailers-round-up-2912356)\ncoming to [PS4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/playstation-4) and\n[Xbox One](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/xbox-one-s) this October,\nRockstar’s attention is focused on the Old West for now.\n\n* * *\n\n**Pre-order Red Dead Redemption 2 from[Amazon UK](http://amzn.to/2FMtwWX) |\n[Amazon.com](http://amzn.to/2GhZGay)**\n\n* * *\n\nBut that doesn’t stop us getting hyped for GTA 6.

Rumours point at Vice City and\na female protagonist, but that’s just what people want to hear, isn’t it?\n\n* * *\n\n### **Looking for console deals?**\n\n  * [Best PS4 deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-ps4-deals-2993085)\n  * [Best Xbox One deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/best-xbox-one-deals-2993078)\n  * [Best Nintendo Switch deals](https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/nintendo-switch-deals-2993180)\n\n* * *\n\n## ![GTA\n6](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-\nplaceholder-3.svg)\n\n## GTA 6 wishlist – Things we’d love to see\n\n**A strong female protagonist**\n\nEvery single GTA game has had a strong male protagonist, whether it’s the trio\nFranklin, Trevor and Michael from GTA 5, Niko from GTA 4 or the legendary\nTommy Vercetti from GTA Vice City\n\nIt’s about time Rockstar Games showed how well it can deal with introducing a\nstrong female character to that line-up, even as part of a multi-protagonist\nsystem like GTA 5.\n\nWe’ve not had a single strong female supporting character since Catalina from\nGTA 3, reappeared in San Andreas either. Let’s not forget her punishment for\nspeaking up was a rocket straight into the helicopter.\n\nRockstar has been criticised in the past for a sexist attitude towards the\nfemale characters in its games, thanks to its penchant for prostitutes and\nstrip clubs. What better way to prove the naysayers wrong than to introduce a\nfemale lead?\n\n**Related:[Best PC Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-pc-\ngames-3520096)**\n\n![GTA 6](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**A fresh location**\n\nOne of the top things on the GTA 6 wishlist is a brand-new location. So far,\nthe GTA series has explored three key areas: Vice City, Liberty City, and San\nAndreas. We’ve also dabbled in London and Alderney in some more minor GTA\ntitles.\n\nDespite there being 15 or so GTA titles, that’s a pretty narrow location\ncircle for the games.\n\nTherefore, we think it’ll be refreshing to explore a new city in GTA 6.\nImagine a GTA game set in Chicago, Philadelphia, New Orleans or even\nWashington DC.\n\n**Improved vehicle variation**\n\nAlthough GTA 5 brought back bicycles, we’d like GTA 6 to branch out on the\nvehicle variation available. If the series continues to go down the San\nAndreas path, wouldn’t it be appropriate for GTA 6 to introduce rollerblades\nand skateboards with which to traverse the boulevards?\n\n**Related:[Call of Duty Black Ops 4](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/call-\nof-duty-black-ops-4-news-release-date-gameplay-wishlist-treyarch-3373836) **\n\n![GTA 6](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Better shops, more houses, and a diverse city**\n\nGTA 5’s San Andreas is certainly vast – bigger in scale than the last three\nGTA games and Red Dead Redemption combined, in fact. However, bigger doesn’t\nnecessarily mean more interactive.\n\nWhile driving through San Andreas’ seemingly unceasing terrain, you quickly\nrealise that there isn’t much to do outside of missions, side quests or the\nStrangers and Freaks meetings.\n\nYes, there are a few stalls on Vespucci Beach and a variety of smaller stores\nif you stray off the pavement, but we’d really appreciate heightened\ninteraction with the stores, houses, and buildings within the new world.\n\n**First-person option from the off**\n\nGTA 5 for Xbox One, PS4 and PC introduced an optional First Person Shooter\n(FPS) mode for the game. It’s a great way to have a really immersive GTA\nexperience and it’s impressive that Rockstar has implemented it in such a way\nthat it’s possible to play through the whole game in the first person.\n\nIt certainly changes up the combat system and driving sections of GTA 5, but\nwe realise it isn’t perhaps the best way to enjoy the game from start to\nfinish.\n\nAlthough it might not be for everyone, the FPS option should definitely be\navailable to everyone from the off. Then you can decide how you play the game\nand customise your viewing angle to your particular playing style.\n\n**Related:**[ **Best Nintendo Switch\nGames**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-nintendo-switch-games)\n\n![GTA 5](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n**Console and PC launch simultaneously**\n\nThis goes without saying really, but we would love a simultaneous console and\nPC release for the next GTA game.\n\n**VR Support**\n\nThe addition of a first-person perspective in GTA 5 added a poignant layer of\nrealism to the experience, so imagine this in virtual reality. Such a feature\nmight prove controversial, but it would certainly feel like a substantial\nstepping stone for a medium still in its infancy. Exploring an expansive open\nworld without restrictions in VR would be simply mind-blowing, and we’d love\nto see Rockstar take a stab at it.\n\n[](https://amzn.to/2tmZS2h)\n\n[](https://amzn.to/2tmZS2h)\n\n###\n\n[Grand Theft Auto V (PS4)\n\n](https://amzn.to/2tmZS2h)\n\n£21.99\n\n[Amazon\n\n](https://amzn.to/2tmZS2h)\n\n[View Deal](https://amzn.to/2tmZS2h)\n\n[Amazon\n\n](https://amzn.to/2tmZS2h)\n\n**Related:** **[Best PS4 Games](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-\nps4-games)**\n\n_**What would you like to see from GTA 6?
