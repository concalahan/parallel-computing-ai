Its 8-core/16-thread configuration provides masses ofprocessing for a fantastic proce.We’ve paired it with the feature-packed Gigabyte X470 Aorus Gaming motherboardand 16GB or RAM. It would be tempting to get 32GB but RAM prices are just toohigh at the moment to justify 32GB for most users.Meanwhile, if you were wondering about both[AMD](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/amd-threadripper-release-date-price-specs-3231747) and [Intel](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/intel-core-i9-specs-release-date-skylake-x-2948774)‘s new ultra-high-endThreadripper and Skylake X CPUs they’re both overkill for most users. The onlyreason most will want to consider them is if you’re building a PC withmultiple graphics cards, and that’s mega-bucks territory.The rest of this system is based on our £1500 gaming PC build with a fast mainSSD and a secondary hard drive for bulk data, plus a quality power supply andcase. We’ve swapped out the CPU cooler for one that’s a tad beefier to copewith the 2700X’s extra heat output.We’ve chosen the Nvidia GTX 1080 Ti graphics so as to deliver one of the bestgaming performance available right now. Only Nvidia’s 20 Series GPUs can beatit, but we’re yet to give them a thorough testing, so we not yet able todetermine whether the RTX 2080 represents a better buy.**Potential swaps:** If you’re after even more of a workstation-type buildthen you may want to swap back to the 32GB of RAM and get a slower graphicscard but otherwise the main consideration here is whether to swap to an IntelCPU. The [Intel Core i7-8700K](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/intel-core-i7-8700k) is the ultimate gaming CPU right now – until Intel releases its9th Gen CPUs – but with this build we wanted something of a balance betweengaming and multi-core workstation workloads.The other alternative is to drop things down a gear by opting for the [AMDRyzen 7 2700](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/amd-ryzen-7-1700). Thischip still gets you eight-core performance but for just £250. Similarly, dropthe motherboard to a £120 MSI X370 SLI Plus and go for a GTX 1070 and you’llhave a multi-core workstation build for around £1500 that’s still mighty goodfor gaming – especiallly if you do a bit of overclocking."}
