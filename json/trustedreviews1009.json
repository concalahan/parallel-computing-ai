While there are\nsimilarities, Photos is less a folder-based filing cabinet and more a giant\nphoto album with basic editing tools and clever machine learning.\n\nIt’s this machine learning that gives Photos its eerily good search abilities\n– and a slight edge over the likes of Amazon Prime Photos, Shoebox and\nCluster. As long as you don’t mind Google combing through your holiday snaps\nand hunting for famous landmarks to tag, of course.\n\n**Related:** [Best Camera Phone\n2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/guide/best-camera-phone)\n\n## **Google Photos – How do I backup my camera’s photos?**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nThere are two ways to start your Google Photos backup – from the desktop app\nor the smartphone app.\n\nTo automatically backup photos from any SD card or desktop folder, you need to\ndownload ‘[Backup & Sync](https://www.google.com/drive/download/backup-and-\nsync/)’ (Windows and Mac).\n\nThis replaces two older desktop apps (Google Photos Backup and Drive) and lets\nPhotos make clones of your photos and videos to stash away safely in the\ncloud.\n\nAre these exact copies or compressed versions? This is the big decision when\nyou’re setting up ‘Backup & Sync’. You get two options: ‘High quality’ or\n‘Original’.\n\nGoogle will store an unlimited number of 16-megapixel photos and 1080p videos\nin ‘High quality’ for free, but this isn’t quite the whole story; they’re\ncompressed, too, to reduce space.\n\nIn our tests, Google’s compression was impressive, crunching files down in\nsize without any major loss in quality. If you mainly view photos on-screen,\nor are largely backing up smartphone snaps, you should be fine with the ‘High\nquality’ option.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nHowever, if you’re a photographer who needs non-compressed RAW backups, or\nyou’re a fan of printing out your snaps, then you’ll probably want to plump\nfor ‘Original’.\n\nAs Google ‘only’ gives you 15GB storage for free, this will likely come at a\ncost, but at £8 per month for 1TB storage (or £79 per year), Google Photos\ncompares favourably to the likes of Dropbox.\n\nThere’s one big caveat: Google Photos doesn’t support every type of RAW file,\nso it’s worth checking [its support\npage](https://support.google.com/photos/answer/6193313?visit_id=1-636641542300390572-417488421&p=filesizes&hl=en&rd=1#filesizes)\nto see if your camera’s version is on there before you splash out on a 20TB\nplan.\n\nDecided to plump for Google Photos? Once you’ve downloaded ‘Backup and Sync’\nand signed into your Google account, it’s then just a case of choosing the\nfolder(s) you want Photos to automatically back up.\n\nTo back up SD cards, you’ll first need to insert one into your SD card slot.\nThen in the ‘Backup & Sync’ setup, click ‘Choose Folder’ and select the SD\ncard as a source to continually back up.\n\nOnce you’re setup, Google Photos’ ‘Backup & Sync’ lives in the menu bar at the\ntop of your screen, where you’ll be able to see it whirring away and saving\ncopies of your snaps to the cloud.\n\n## **Google Photos – How do I back up my smartphone snaps?**\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nLooking for an easy way to automatically back up your smartphone’s camera\nroll? The Google Photos app is a good choice for this, too.\n\nDownload it for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/google-\nphotos/id962194608?mt=8) or\n[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.photos&hl=en_GB),\nmake sure ‘Backup & Sync’ is turned on, and your smartphone photos will be\nautomatically backed up to Google’s servers.\n\nNaturally, you get slightly less control in iOS compared to Android. For\nexample, in the Android app you can specify which folders Photos backs up,\nsuch as Instagram, downloads or screenshots. To do that, go into ‘Backup &\nSync’ then select ‘Back up device folders’ to toggle certain folders on and\noff.\n\nIf you’re running out of internal smartphone storage due to some slightly\nover-enthusiastic snapping, the Photos app’s ‘Free up space’ option will also\nhandily delete any photos on your phone that are already backed up.\n\n**Related:** [Best phone 2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-\nsmartphone-3431175)\n\n## **Google Photos – How do I backup my analogue photos?**\n\n![Google\nPhotos](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nGoogle’s cloud photo album isn’t just for digital snaps – if you have a stack\nof wedding Polaroids that you want to save for posterity, there’s a link to\nGoogle’s PhotoScan app in the Photos menu.\n\nThis lets you use your phone’s camera to scan physical snaps, which are then\nautomatically sent to your Google Photos backup.\n\nEven better, If your photos are black and white family heirlooms, Google\nPhotos will soon be able to colorise them. This feature was announced at\n[Google I/O 2018](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-io-2018-3382045),\nalthough Google hasn’t said exactly when it will be coming to the Google\nPhotos app. We’ll update this feature as soon as it arrives.\n\n## **Google Photos – How can I make a photo book?**\n\n![Google\nPhotos](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nGoogle’s Photo books service was first announced back in 2017, but you can now\nfinally get a physical incarnation of your favourite snaps posted to you in\nthe UK.\n\nGo to the [Photo books site](https://photos.google.com/photobooks) and it’ll\nsuggest some albums for you from your collection, though you’re probably best\noff choosing your own by pressing the ‘start a new book’ button.\n\nThe site groups shots by location and time period then gives you an\nattractive, gift-friendly layout (which you can make tweaks to).\n\nThe books contain 20 pages, though you can add extra ones from 49p per page up\nto a maximum on 100 pages. Pricing is pretty reasonable too, with soft-covered\nbooks starting at £11.99 and hardcover ones available for £22.99.\n\nYou’ll need to shell out a little extra for shipping too (around £4.99 for\n‘economy’ delivery), but the total cost is still pretty reasonable for\ncharming reminder of an event or your year’s highlights. We’ll update this\npage when we’ve had the chance to order one and test out its paper and print\nquality.\n\n**Related:** [Google Photos will add colour to your black-and-white\nphotographs](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-photos-colourise-\npictures-black-white-3469620)\n\n"}
