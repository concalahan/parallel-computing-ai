The company also recommends being on a connection with a minimumdownload speed of 6Mbps for the smoothest streaming experience.As well as live streams, the company will let you watch highlights on-demand.What’s more, any matches it shows live will be available on-demand – and intheir entirety, boring bits and all – for a full 24 hours.As games are being streamed and not televised, we’d recommend staying awayfrom Twitter and any live blogs, in order to avoid spoilers.“As with all online streaming, there will be a short delay on our liveoutput,” the company has confirmed. “The Eleven Sports platform will featureadaptive playback which dynamically adjusts the quality of the video streamyou receive based on the speed of your connection.”**Are you tempted by Eleven Sports?
