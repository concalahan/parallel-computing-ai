The HP Envy x2,\nAsus NovaGo and Lenovo Miix 630 all have incredibly impressive battery life,\nbut performance can also be extremely sluggish, and there are software\ncompatibility issues too.\n\nWith the 850, which has been specifically built for Windows 10 devices and\nwill not come to smartphones, Qualcomm is promising faster performance, higher\ndata speeds and even longer battery life.\n\n## Latest\n\n  * [ ![Twitter Trump](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg) Credit: @lgbtfeedla \n\n### Twitter gives users more power to report fakers, as purge continues\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/twitter-is-giving-users-more-power-to-\nreport-fake-accounts-as-purge-continues-3613624 \"Twitter gives users more\npower to report fakers, as purge continues\")\n\n  * [ ![Amazon Echo Dot \\(3rd Gen\\) 1 hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to enable it\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-enable-alexa-whisper-mode-\necho-3607478 \"Alexa’s new whisper mode rolls out in US today – here’s how to\nenable it\")\n\n  *   * [ ![LG CLOi hero](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-reviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\n### LG CLOi robots in action – from cute personal assistants to industrial\nfloor care\n\n](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/lg-cloi-robot-3600210 \"LG CLOi robots in\naction – from cute personal assistants to industrial floor care\")\n\n  * \n\nAccording to the company, Snapdragon 850-powered devices will offer a 30%\nperformance boost over Snapdragon 835-powered computers. That’s good news on\npaper, but we can’t jump to any conclusions before we’ve had the chance to\nactually spend some time with a Snapdragon 850 machine. In a demo, a Qualcomm-\nbuilt reference design (pictured below) performed smoothly while running\nVendetta.\n\nQualcomm says that the new chip will bring a 20% battery life boost too (up to\n25 hours of continuous usage), as well as a 20% increase in Gigabit LTE speeds\n(up to 1.2Gbps in theory), and 30% faster graphics.\n\n“The Snapdragon 850 Mobile Compute Platform is designed to support many\nsought-after smartphone features in the PC and to stay connected to LTE or Wi-\nFi so users can receive notifications and have their data virtually always\nsynced on the go,” said Qualcomm.\n\nAlex Katouzian, the senior vice president and general manager of Qualcomm’s\nmobile business unit, also promised new AI-based features, such as a power\nmanagement tool, describing artificial intelligence as “part of everyday life\nnow”.\n\n![](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/07/trusted-\nreviews-placeholder-3.svg)\n\nSnapdragon 850 reference design\n\n## Snapdragon 850: New hardware and release date\n\nQualcomm is yet to spill the beans on new hardware, but it has revealed that\nSamsung, HP, Asus and Lenovo will be releasing Snapdragon 850-powered devices\nlater this year. They’ll arrive in time for the holiday season.\n\nRecent leaks have also suggested that Dell is working on a rather unusual-\nsounding Snapdragon 850 device. According to\n[reports](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/dell-working-multi-screen-\nwindows-10-arm-device-snapdragon-850-3479819), it will feature two screens,\nand could be used as both a tablet and a smartphone.\n\nPerhaps concerningly, Katouzian mentioned at the Snapdragon 850 reveal that\nresearch indicated that consumers are “willing to pay more” for devices with\nbetter battery life and Gigabit LTE connectivity.\n\nWe considered the £1000 835-powered Envy x2 to be fairly vastly overpriced.\nIndeed, at a roundtable, Qualcomm’s VP of global product marketing, Don\nMcGuire, said he believes $600-$800 is the “sweet spot” for Snapdragon-powered\nWindows 10 devices.\n\n"}
